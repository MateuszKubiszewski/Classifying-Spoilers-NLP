			"It’ll be just like old times this weekend for Tom Brady and Wes Welker.",
			"Welker revealed Friday morning on a Miami radio station that he contacted Brady because he’ll be in town for Sunday’s game between the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium. It seemed like a perfect opportunity for the two to catch up.",
			"But Brady’s definition of \"catching up\" involves far more than just a meal. In fact, it involves some literal \"catching\" as the Patriots quarterback looks to stay sharp during his four-game Deflategate suspension.",
			"\"I hit him up to do dinner Saturday night. He’s like, ‘I’m going to be flying in from Ann Arbor later (after the Michigan-Colorado football game), but how about that morning we go throw?’ \" Welker said on WQAM, per The Boston Globe. \"And I’m just sitting there, I’m like, ‘I was just thinking about dinner, but yeah, sure. I’ll get over there early and we can throw a little bit.’ \"",
			"Welker was one of Brady’s favorite targets for six seasons from 2007 to 2012. It’s understandable him and Brady want to meet with both being in the same area. But Brady typically is all business during football season. Welker probably should have known what he was getting into when reaching out to his buddy.",
			"\"That’s the only thing we really have planned,\" Welker said of his upcoming workout with Brady. \"It’s just funny. I’m sitting there trying to have dinner. ‘Hey, get your ass up here and let’s go throw.’ I’m like, ‘Aw jeez, man.’ He’s going to have me running like 2-minute drills in his backyard or something.\"",
			"Maybe Brady will put a good word in for Welker down in Foxboro if the former Patriots wide receiver impresses him enough."

			"2070 is shaping up to be a great year for Mother Earth.",
			"That's when NASA scientists are predicting the hole in the ozone layer might finally make a full recovery. Researchers announced their conclusion, in addition to other findings, in a presentation Wednesday during the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.",
			"The team of scientists specifically looked at the chemical composition of the ozone hole, which has shifted in both size and depth since the passing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. The agreement banned its 197 signatory countries from using chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that break down into chlorine in the upper atmosphere and harm the ozone layer.",
			"They found that, while levels of chlorine in the atmosphere have indeed decreased as a result of the protocol, it's too soon to tie them to a healthier ozone layer.",
			"\"Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline,\" Susan Strahan of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center explained in a media briefing. \"That assumption is like trying to understand what's wrong with your car's engine without lifting the hood.\"",
			"Instead, the scientists believe the most recent ozone hole changes, including both the largest hole ever, in 2006, and one of the smallest holes, in 2012, are primarily due to weather. Strong winds have the ability to move ozone in large quantities, effectively blocking the hole some years, while failing to block it in others.",
			"\"At the moment, it is winds and temperatures that are really controlling how big [the ozone hole] is,\" Strahan told the BBC.",
			"LiveScience reports weather is expected to be the predominant factor in the ozone hole's size until 2025, at which point CFCs will have dropped enough as a result of the Montreal Protocol to become noticeable.",
			"By 2070, however, the ozone hole is expected to have made a full recovery.",
			"\"It’s not going to be a smooth ride,\" Strahan cautioned the Los Angeles Times. \"There will be some bumps in the road, but overall the trend is downward.\""

			"Passion is overrated — 7 work habits you need instead"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"It’s common wisdom. Near gospel really, and not just among young people and founders. Across generational lines, sentiments like those from Steve Jobs’ 2005 commencement at Stanford have been engraved into our collective consciousness:  ",
			"\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.\" ",
			"In other words, follow your passion. There’s just one problem: \"‘Follow your passion’ is dangerous advice.\" ",
			"That’s a troubling claim, but it comes straight from Cal Newport’s investigation into \"the details of how passionate people like Steve Jobs really got started\" as well as what scientists say predicts happiness and fuels great accomplishment. ",
			"Newport’s not alone. In recent years, a host of leaders, academics, and entrepreneurs have all come to the same startling conclusion: nearly everything you’ve been told about following your passion is wrong. ",
			"Here are seven habits you need instead. ",
			"Ryan Holiday, author of Ego Is the Enemy:",
			"\"Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with — no, because of — passion. ... [P]urpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.\" ",
			"Until about a century ago, passion was a dirty word. Classical philosopher like Socrates and Marcus Aurelius saw passion as a liability not an asset: an insatiable and destructive force. Why? ",
			"Chiefly because passion is dangerously self-centered. In fact, our own modern descriptions of passion betray this inward bend: \"I want to [blank]. I need to [blank]. I have to [blank].\" In most cases, whatever word finishes those sentences — regardless of how well meaning it might be — is overshadowed by the first. ",
			"Purpose, on the other hand, is about them, not me. It reorients our focus onto the people and causes we’re trying to reach, serve, help, and love. In The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes this pursuit as a \"striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\" ",
			"Passion makes us bigger. Purpose connects us to something bigger and in doing so makes us right sized. ",
			"Shaa Wasmund, author of Stop Talking, Start Doing:",
			"\"‘No’ is a far more powerful word than ‘Yes.’ Every ‘Yes’ said out of obligation or fear takes time away from the things and people we love. When an opportunity appears connected with your passion, it’s even trickier. Instead of snatching up everything that might get your closer to the life you want, give yourself the space to pick carefully.\" ",
			"Good is the enemy of great. That’s how Jim Collins put it anyway. Learning to say \"No\" is easily one of the most vital skills we can cultivate. And yet, even if you’ve mastered \"No\" to the obvious stuff, passion rears its head. ",
			"The blinding effect of passion leads us unthinkingly into projects and meetings that, in truth, are dead ends. Worse, they sap time and energy that would otherwise move us forward. When Tim Ferriss asked journalist Kara Swisher what message she’d put on a billboard for millions to see, her answer was a single word, \"Stop.\" ",
			"And that’s what picking is all about: slow down, pause, evaluate, weigh, and only then make a clear-headed choice. Picking involves, first, putting a time buffer on our decisions, particularly decisions that appear \"connected with your passion.\" Second, running our choices by an objective third party: a friend or colleague who can call out our blind spots. ",
			"Sleep on it. Reach out. The sun will rise tomorrow. And be ruthless with your \"No’s.\" ",
			"Angela Duckworth, author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance:",
			"\"After you’ve discovered and developed interest in a particular area, you must devote yourself to the sort of focused, full-hearted, challenge-exceeding-skill practice that leads to mastery. You must zero in on your weaknesses, and you must do so over and over again, for hours a day, week after month after year.\" ",
			"We all love shortcuts. The allure of getting more by doing less is seductive. But are there times when doing more equals more? Absolutely.  ",
			"The classic illustration comes from David Bayles and Ted Orland’s Art and Fear where a ceramics teacher divided his class into two groups. The first was told they’d be graded on quality. The other, quantity. To get an A, the quantity group was required to produce fifty pounds of clay pots. Not exactly an artistically inspired assignment. And yet, when grading time came, \"a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.\" ",
			"What accounted for this reversal of expectations?  ",
			"Easy: while the quality group held back — laboring under perfectionism — the quantity group got busy. They practiced. And that’s good news. If greatness came down to passion — or worse, talent — then it’d be reserved for only a select few. Practice means greatness is doable ... one tiny step after another. ",
			"Liran Kotzer, CEO of Woo.io:",
			"\"Passion is indeed very important, but what most people don't know is what’s needed to achieve their true potential. Whether it’s to acquire new skills, get a promotion, or achieve what they want, it all starts with having a plan based on real data and real-world options.\" ",
			"The only word less sexy than practice is planning. And yet planning is a golden thread woven through the lives of artists, leaders, and entrepreneurs alike. The trick here is that plans need not be grandiose. Rather, they shouldn’t be. ",
			"Optimism is wonderful when it comes to our dreams. However, when it comes to what’s next — the nitty-gritty actions that’ll get us there — optimism kills. Infected with passion, our plans lose touch with reality. We overestimate strengths and underestimate challenges. Beyond the \"real data and real-world options,\" we build castles in the sky. That’s one of the reasons platform like Woo, which lets you get feedback from companies and headhunters anonymously, are so valuable. ",
			"Where passion disconnects us from reality, planning — especially planning of the SMART goal and number-crunching variety — drives home the true state of affairs.  ",
			"That true state rescues us from false expectations, show stoppers, and resentment. As a good friend of mine likes to say, \"The question when you’re trying to bring a dream into reality shouldn’t be, ‘What going to go right?’ It should be, ‘What’s going to go wrong?’\" ",
			"Jason Stone, founder of Millionaire Mentor Inc.:",
			"\"Passion can only take you so far. After that, if you don't have the skills, the tools, the resources, the knowledge, and the track-record to move forward, take risks, and expand. Otherwise, you won’t be able to position yourself as an authority. Positioning is key to make sure you are ready when opportunity strikes!\" ",
			"Humans are associative creatures. We think and act not in isolation but by comparing and contrasting. ",
			"\"The basic approach of positioning,\" wrote Al Ries and Jack Trout in Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, \"is not to create something new and different, but to manipulate what’s already up there in the mind, to retie the connections that already exist.\" This is especially true when it comes to how other people see us. ",
			"Passionate people often come off as self-inflated. They’re legends in their own minds. Positioning means leveraging who you are and what you’ve done as a springboard to what’s next. It embraces the associate nature of other people and — while it still leaves room for confidence — acknowledges that how others perceive us is more real, at least to them, than how we see ourselves. ",
			"Troy Osinoff, author of My Bad Parent: Do As I Say, Not as I Did:",
			"\"People that think they completely understand their world are the most susceptible to overlook new opportunities. Peripheral is about establishing an unwavering curiosity to use your existing knowledge in uncovering new patterns and trends both for the sake of your personal development as well as the success of your business or career.\" ",
			"Passion makes us myopic. We become so focused on the desire inside us, we lose sight of what’s around us. Objectivity — the ability to see the world as it truly is — atrophies in the blinding light of passion. ",
			"Adopting a peripheral perspective forces us to examine the margins. It widens our view. Rather than rush headlong into disaster, we’re able to spot not just the pitfalls but the opportunities we would have otherwise missed. ",
			"How? By cultivating curiosity. Questions like, \"What am I missing? What am I ignoring? Who could give me a fresh take?\" are vital in every area of life. Likewise, so is putting ourselves in new situations, reading books outside our passions, and intentionally pursuing people who have nothing to do with what it is we think we want. ",
			"Brian D. Evans, founder of Influencive and Inc. 500 Entrepreneur:",
			"\"The person who calls themselves a student is more a master than those who try to wear the title. Get up when you get knocked down. Come back stronger, faster, and (above all) smarter. The constant desire to learn and overcome has helped me achieve everything. You must persevere.\" ",
			"Although it might sound odd, perseverance is as much about putting in effort as it is battling ego. Drunk on passion, masters are doomed to repeat failures in the name of \"pushing through.\" In contrast, students do more than hone their craft; they learn from their mistakes. ",
			"Asked if the Patriot’s historic comeback in Super Bowl LI was his \"greatest game ever,\" Tom Brady replied: \"[W]hen I think of an interception return for a touchdown, some other missed opportunities in the first 37, 38 minutes of the game, I don’t really consider playing a good quarter-and-a-half, plus overtime as one of the ‘best games ever’ but it was certainly one of the most thrilling.\" ",
			"Certainly Brandy persevered, and it’d be nice if that guaranteed success. But sometimes you won’t come back to win it. At least, not in the moment. Jobs will be lost. Pitches turned down. Relationships ended. And reviews harsh.  ",
			"Failure, however, isn’t just an inevitable stepping stone toward success. Rejection is part of success itself. As Louis CK put it to a budding comedian, \"The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time and, if you don’t give up, you will get better.\" ",
			"Understood rightly, no. But as the be-all-and-end-all? Yes. ",
			"Cal Newport’s prescription was skill: passion is the result of excellence, not it’s source.  ",
			"Far from a magic bullet, passion can mislead us, blind us, and even turn us in on ourselves. Newport was right: \"‘Follow your passion’ might just be terrible advice.\" Thankfully, these seven habits put passion in its place so that the fire Jobs spoke of doesn’t burn out ... but endures. ",

			"5/5 say yes.",
			"Cheers to your health! All five of our experts give red wine a purple-stained smile.",
			"At 125 calories for a five-ounce pour, it's a lighter choice than beer and mixed drinks, says Julia Zumpano , a dietitian at Cleveland Clinic’s Heart & Vascular Institute. And yes, it's got more antioxidants, too—including resveratrol, that famous compound billed as the miracle in chocolate and vino.",
			"But recent research has given resveratrol the side eye as the reason for wine's healthy glow. The aptly-named inCHIANTI study, a 16-year-long look at the blood, urine and dietary questionnaires of hundreds of people living in the Italian wine-making region of Chianti, recently found that resveratrol wasn't associated with disease or lifespan, to the shock and dismay of wine lovers everywhere. But that doesn't mean red wine does nothing for you—just that resveratrol might not be compound that deserves all the credit. \"Many studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption, especially wine, is associated with lower cardiovascular disease and mortality compared with both no alcohol consumption or consumption above moderate,\" says Luigi Ferrucci , founder of the inCHIANTI study and now scientific director of the National Institute on Aging. \"The mechanism of this association is not clear, and does not appear to be related to resveratrol.\"",
			"And even if it does have a positive effect, some experts say there's likely not enough in a glass to make a difference. \"Despite the common belief, resveratrol content in wine is very low, highly variable and thus unpredictable ,\" says Juan Carlos Espín , a research professor in the department of food science and technology at the Spanish National Research Council who studies the compound. Red wine's wide spectrum of polyphenols is the more important part, and you'll probably have to commit to the habit (moderately!) to get lasting health benefits, he says.",
			"What we do know, says David Katz , MD, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, is that drinking habitually but moderately prevails in the Mediterranean diet. \"So whatever the mechanisms, moderate alcohol intake—perhaps red wine especially—is associated with health and long life,\" Katz says.",
			"Light drinking in general—up to a drink a day for women, and two for men—is known to be good for you, says James O'Keefe, MD, chief of preventive cardiology at Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City. It’s associated with lower risk for coronary artery disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure and stroke. And all of our experts agreed that red wine takes the ribbon. \"Red wine is clearly the drink of choice if you are doing light to moderate drinking for your health, and daily consumption just before or with the evening meal may be the most protective pattern,\" O’Keefe says.",
			"In fact, O’Keefe says his grandma Dorothy used to enjoy a happy hour drink every night, and she lived to be 103. \"She used to joke, ‘The key to a long healthy life is to not drink too much...but then again, don't drink too little either.’\""

			"Analysis: This may be the most brutal number in the CBO report"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Plenty has been made of the big Congressional Budget Office finding that 24 million people could lose their insurance under Republicans' Obamacare replacement over the next decade. That's higher than expected and poses a clear and massive hurdle for Republicans as they attempt to convince dozens of skeptical members.",
			"But there's another number that paints a particularly dire picture for the GOP's alternative — especially in light of President Trump's populist rhetoric.",
			"According to the CBO, 64-year olds making $26,500 per year would see their premiums increase by an estimated 750 percent by 2026. While they are on track to pay $1,700 under the current law, the CBO projects the American Health Care Act would force them to pay $14,600. Even if you grant that inflation will allow them to make slightly more money by 2026, that's still about half of their income going to health care.",
			"Here's how that looks as a percentage of income (h/t Philip Bump):",
			"As skeptics of the law noted, that suggests the reason premiums as a whole will eventually decline is because older, poorer people simply won't be able to afford it. The legislation reduces premiums substantially for younger people but increases them substantially for older people — and especially poorer, older people — according to the CBO.",
			"The CBO's estimate of the premium increases for older, poorer Americans is actually worse than a previous one from AARP. Here's what AARP, which has announced its opposition to the bill, said last week:",
			"... Our estimates find that, taken together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much as $3,600 for a 55-year old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000 for a 64-year old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for a 64-year old earning $15,000 a year.",
			"If you're a Republican looking at these numbers, you have to be concerned — just from a self-preservation standpoint.",
			"Republican leaders have made great pains to argue that the CBO's estimate of the millions who will lose insurance is faulty, or even that it's a necessary side effect of returning to a more free-market approach to health care. But the GOP's counter-argument is predicated on the idea that its alternative would at least allow people access to coverage. Paying such a substantial portion of one's income on health insurance doesn't meet that goal — if, in fact, the CBO's estimate is anywhere close to accurate.",
			"It also affects a group of voters who are integral to the Trump Coalition. Less-formally educated and lower-income white Americans were the backbone of the electoral shift that allowed President Trump to be elected, and he has promised them the world: Coverage that is even more affordable than the Affordable Care Act and \"insurance for everybody.\"",
			"On top of all that, older people are much more likely to vote than younger people, especially in a midterm election like 2018. So basically, Trump's win was built on older, poorer people, for whom this law appears to drive up premiums and drive down the insurance rate, while benefiting the younger and wealthier.",
			"That's not something that will assure skeptical Republicans at all — even if they can get past that 24 million number."

			"Almost every place you shop online has a \"promotional code\" box at checkout -- but fewer than a quarter of shoppers use it. We asked the experts for their best advice on where and how to cash in.",
			"By Lynn Andriani",
			"Start With Your Wardrobe",
			"David Weinrot, chief marketing officer at the coupon code site Tada!, says apparel is the top category for sitewide coupon codes (flowers and home goods are big, too), since there's so much inventory and retailers constantly need to make room for new items. Clothing is also where you'll find the biggest discounts, says Daniel Washburn, general manager of another coupon-code site, Coupon Mountain. While some sites broadcast a \"25% off today only!\" coupon code at the top of their home page, more use coupon sites (which get a commission of about 5 percent when you click on a code) to get the word out. There are a couple of tricks to finding these money-saving treasures, aside from searching for a store name with a term like \"coupon\" or \"coupon code,\" says Sarah Jones, coupon editor at DealNews.com. For clothing, she searches the brand name and style name (e.g., \"Michael Kors Chain Lace-Up Shirtdress\") plus the word \"coupon.\" Then she searches for coupons for stores that sell the item, to see what they are currently offering. The idea is to do a mix of general and specific searches to see what comes up.",
			"Upgrade Your Electronics Piece by Piece",
			"Tech retailers, such as TigerDirect and Newegg, release the most coupon codes, says Jones -- but you won't find 30 percent off everything sitewide with those retailers. Since the category has such small margins, stores can't afford to discount widely; instead, they offer codes that give heavy discounts for particular items. For the quickest results, Jones likes to search by model number (this works especially well for electronics and computers).",
			"Shop At The Beginning Of The Month -- Or On A Monday",
			"Most retailers release their codes onto sales channels at the beginning of the month, and the majority expire on the 15th or 30th. In particular, Weinrot says retailers that sell items that need replenishing -- such as vitamins, diapers and contact-lens solutions -- tend to release coupon codes early in the month, since they know that's when people tend to restock. You can look for codes throughout the month on Mondays, since many stores rotate new offers on a weekly basis, says Jones.",
			"Do The Math",
			"Prices vary widely: You might find that one store's price without a coupon might be better than another store's price with one. Also consider shipping costs. For instance, a store that has everyday free shipping may have a price that comes out lower with a 10-percent-off coupon than another store's 20-percent coupon with shipping charges added, says Jones. A general rule of thumb: For smaller purchases, take a free shipping code over a code for 10 percent off; for larger purchases, 10 percent (or more) off will probably save you more money than free shipping would.",

			"Some stores rarely or never offer coupon codes (Jones cites Walmart and Zappos as examples). But DealNews shared with us their list of the top 25 retailers, sorted by volume of published coupons in 2013:",

			" The controversial past of public bathrooms",
			"Target, facing a boycott over its policy of allowing transgender customers and employees to use the bathroom of their choice, says it will spend $20 million to expand bathroom options at all of its U.S. stores.",
			"Target ( TGT CFO Cathy Smith said Wednesday that the company has heard objections to the transgender bathroom policy from some customers, though she said other customers had voiced support. In response, Target has decided to expand its use of a third, single-toilet bathroom at all of its stores, which can be locked by users.",
			"That bathroom can be used by any customer who needs some privacy, including parents with small children of a different gender or those who are uncomfortable with a public bathroom in which a transgender person is allowed.",
			"\"We put that in motion for some time prior to the [June] shareholders meeting,\" said spokeswoman Katie Boylan. \"At the end of the day, Target is all about inclusion. We want everyone to feel comfortable in our stores.\"",
			"There are about 1,800 U.S. Target stores, and all but 300 already have the single occupancy bathrooms available. All but about 25 of those stores should have the new bathrooms by the end of the year, and the remaining stores should get them early in 2017, Boylan said.",
			"The retailer reported disappointing sales and cut its forecast on future sales Wednesday morning, sending its stock lower.",

That's why they invited BBC Click reporter Dan Simmons to stand on the bridge above a sample panel of glass, and go to town on it with a sledgehammer. But the result may not have been what they were looking for:",
			"OK, so in a sense, the experiment was a success. Although Simmons' first blow shattered the glass, he was unable to structurally compromise the underlying layers even after he let loose on it dozens of times. But that won't stop this video from making people who see it want to puke from terror. And is it really good press for this bridge to show it splintering instantly like a drunk college student's iPhone screen?",
			"Imagine if people were on that bridge and it cracked like that? Would they really care about the physics of its structural integrity? Or would they stampede to the other side, trampling each other like frightened elephants? That's the problem with glass bridges—everyone wants to give them a shot, but nobody is actually ready to accept death."

			"After adding a much requested pinch and zoom feature last week, Facebook-owned photo sharing giant Instagram is taking away a popular feature-photo maps.",
			"According to technology news site Mashable, Instagram is killing the feature that allowed you to see a map of where a given user's photos were taken (if they designated a location for the photo). You could also zoom in on maps to get a closer view of where photos were taken in a particular city or region. Instagram's base of approximately 500 million users can still see their own personal photo maps, but just no longer access other users' maps.",
			"\"Photo Map was not widely used, so we've decided to remove the feature and focus on other priorities,\" the company said in a statement to Mashable.",
			"The removal of a feature is a rarity for Instagram, which has been on a tear recently adding new features as it looks to compete with mobile messaging rival Snapchat.",
			"Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.",
			"For example, with Pinch and Zoom, users can use the pinch and zoom gesture on their iPhone screen to zoom on photos and videos in the main feed, on other user’s profiles, and in the explore tab of the app.",
			"A few weeks ago, Instagram debuted a new feature called Stories, operating similar to Snapchat’s feature with the same name. Like Snapchat’s Stories, the Instagram version allows users to collect a number of individual photos and videos into a \"story\" that they can share with their followers.",
			"The Facebook-owned app also recently launched an events-themed video section, which is comparable to a feature that Snapchat has been offering for some time. Earlier this year, Instagram started filtering its main feed using an algorithm, following in the footsteps of parent company Facebook."

			"The subway is a germaphobe’s nightmare: the steep stairs that dare you not to hold the handrail, the ticket-vending touchscreen tacky with fingerprints, the smush of people packed together, all with questionable levels of hygiene.",
			"This must mean that subway cars are just as packed with microbes . But should we be worried? A group of researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health wanted to find out, so they took a bunch of trips on the Boston city subway and started swabbing. In their new study published in the American Society for Microbiology’s journal mSystems , the scientists report on what they found when they sampled the seats, seat backs, walls, poles, ticketing machines and hanging straps on the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority.",
			"They were amazed at how much the city subway looks, microbially speaking, like a mosaic of humans. The most dominant bacteria on all of the surfaces were from people's skin and mouths. And the kinds of colonies that thrived in certain places, like hanging grips, depended on how that surface is used: the scientists found enriched colonies of breathing-borne bacteria on touchscreens and vaginal bacteria on fuzzy polyester seats. Happily, though, the scientists didn’t find pathogenic organisms that typically cause sickness or antibiotic-resistant genes.",
			"\"I was surprised by the degree to which these environments really do look like people,\" says senior author Curtis Huttenhower, associate professor of computational biology and bioinformatics. \"But if you think about the relative size of a bacteria compared to how porous clothing is, it’s no surprise that we’re shedding all sorts of bugs.\"",
			"In the future, this kind of technology might be helpful to monitor the microbes in different environments, like a subway, an airport or a kindergarten classroom. If the colonies started to shift from their normal state, that could signal the start of flu season or an early outbreak of norovirus, for example, and officials would get an early cue that it’s time to step up interventions like handwashing.",
			"So ditch the tissue when you hold the train pole. Riding the subway, Huttenhower says, is just like shaking a bunch of people’s hands."

			"That's almost half as many students as there should be, if Hogwarts has 1,000 students as Rowling said.",
			"There are seven years, and four houses. So theoretically, there should be about 35 Gryffindor students in Harry's year, almost double the 18 we see.",

		"targetParagraphs": [
			"By Mark Alsip and Kavin Senapathy",
			"Depending on whom you ask, Goop.com is either a ritzy lifestyle publication or a grab bag of the ridiculous, from advice on vaginal steam treatments to a shopping section featuring a $73 wooden spoon and a $576 earring (you read that right; it’s a single earring for the left ear).",
			"The site’s curator, actress and aspirational human being Gwyneth Paltrow, isn’t only out to sell a lifestyle but to protect us from the so-called toxins she claims lurk in beauty products, foods and non-steamed vaginas found in average neighborhoods, poisoning unsuspecting commoners. The site’s name is derived from Paltrow’s initials and features her face throughout, at times smiling, other times solemn, and occasionally covered in high-end luxury goop, known as face cream or mask for the frugal department store shoppers. In other words, Goop is an internet extension of all things Gwyneth.",
			"As Paltrow herself has been called a hypocrite, for everything from smoking cigarettes once a week to attending a swanky gala mere hours after publicly shopping on a food stamp budget, so too should Goop be judged. When celebs and sites whose advice fans hold dear warn against exposure to certain ostensibly harmful chemicals and in the next breath sell products containing those same substances, we wonder whether they’re disingenuous or sincerely misinformed. This chemical hypocrisy is a common phenomenon as co-author Mark Alsip frequently reveals on his Bad Science Debunked blog, and one Goop is no stranger to.",
			"In the Goop article \"Full-On—Yet Totally Non-Toxic—Lipstick,\" the site recommends seven \"better-than-good-enough-to-eat\" lip colors that aren’t \"potentially toxic.\" This and other Goop articles suggest dire health consequences from topical use or ingestion of several chemicals including aluminum, and personal care products containing it are squarely in the lifestyle maven’s crosshairs. An entire Goop exposé dedicated to \"toxic\" lipsticks features aluminum, the most common metal in the Earth’s crust, prominently as an ingredient to avoid.",
			"Since Goop asserts that aluminum is harmful even in small amounts, we wonder whether Paltrow’s team intentionally overlooked that two of the three Rituel de Fille \"Forbidden\" lipsticks the site sells contain aluminum hydroxide. Paltrow’s unscientific definition of a \"dangerous\" chemical compound seems to be the mere presence of aluminum rather than the amount and mode of exposure, an important distinction toxicologists make. Nearly a dozen products on Goop contain the element in various compounds, and peddling the item on the same website that calls it dangerous is indefensible.",
			"Aluminum, Paltrow’s site warns, can contribute to heavy metal toxicity, calling the condition \"one of the greatest threats to our health and well-being.\" Perhaps Goop needs to add a disclaimer: Expect hyperbole. Though Goop says that heavy metal toxicity is \"quite common,\" experts disagree. \"Unfortunately for quacks (and fortunately for us), genuine heavy metal poisoning is increasingly uncommon,\" explains Dr. David Gorski, outspoken critic of alternative medicine, at the Science Based Medicine blog. \"[O]ften the diagnosis of \"heavy metal toxicity\" made by alt-med practitioners is based on 'provoked' urine levels, a methodology that has no validity.\""

			"DIS, -1.77% An alligator killed a 2-year-old boy at a Walt Disney Worldresort in Orlando, Fla. earlier this month, prompting discussions about safety in the area where he was pulled underwater.",
			"Despite the fear this type of tragedy causes, the odds of a fatal alligator attack in the U.S. are small. In fact, bees, wasps, hornets, dogs and even cows kill more Americans each year than alligators — or even sharks — do.",
			"The Washington Post used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — the U.S. health agency based in Atlanta — to show which animals cause the most deaths in the country each year . The CDC tracks Americans’ deaths based on their death certificates to keep detailed records on mortality.",
			"Bees, wasps and hornets caused the most deaths, an average of 58 per year between 2001 and 2013, according to the Post’s analysis of the CDC data. Cows killed 20 people each year, dogs killed 28, and a separate category called \"other mammals\" accounted for 52 deaths per year. Sharks, alligators and bears killed one person each year, on average.",
			"The deaths caused by cows don’t include health problems from eating beef; according to the CDC, most of the cow-related deaths happen to people working with cattle in enclosed areas or herding them. Their handlers typically have died from blunt force trauma to their heads or chests.",
			"That said, alligator attacks happen more often than once a year; they just aren’t always fatal.",
			"Alligators bit nine people in 2015 in the state of Florida, and one of them fatally — a 61-year-old man who was snorkeling was killed by a 12-foot alligator — according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. That was slightly fewer bites than in the preceding years; in 2013, alligators bit 15 people, and in 2012 and 2014 they bit 10.",
			"Because in Florida’s population has been growing (it reached more than 20.2 million in 2015 , up from 18.8 million in 2010, according to the U.S. Census) there has also been an increase in alligator complaints, according to the Commission; it has fielded an average of 16,000 alligator-related complaints each year in the last decade. As a result, the Commission has a Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program that allows the killing of 7,000 \"nuisance alligators\" each year.",

			"To help encourage companies to start advertising on its platform, Snapchat also partnered with a number of creative agencies with expertise in making Snapchat ads, as well as agencies that can help with the tech and analytics side of advertising.",
			"Peter Sellis, Snapchat’s head of monetization product, told Adweek,",
			"We have to be thoughtful about the inventory, ad load and the ad experience. But we also know that we cannot build custom ad-tech solutions for every big type of advertiser, for every vertical. And so these [partners] really excel in those kinds of ways.",
			"Though the ads will occasionally show up in between different stories as users auto-advance, they won’t appear in the middle of one story in an attempt to not overwhelm users, according to TechCrunch.",
			"To that end, Snapchat also will apparently review every ad. I don’t know how much reviewing every ad will really help Snapchat’s users, but it’s good to see Snapchat being proactive about this rollout.",
			"Sellis added,",
			"By doing this the right way, focused on creativity and doing it early, it allows us to be extraordinarily conservative.",
			"Well, Snapchat can try to sell me on the idea of ads in any way it wants, but I’m still not buying."

			"I was about eight when someone showed me how to draw this. It started with two sets of three parallel lines that were joined diagonally left to right, then capped off at the top and bottom with pointy bits. It was a fierce, beautiful \"S,\" and drawing it was addictive.",
			"Soon all my schoolbooks were covered in the \"S.\" I never questioned what it meant or where it came from. I just knew I loved it. But it turns out I wasn't the only one.",
			"I recently googled the \"S\" and discovered that although everyone loves it, no one knows its origins. Various Reddits and notice boards are full of really nostalgic people without a clue.",
			"It seems the \"S\" has appeared throughout all of North America, South America, Europe, Russia, Asia, and Australia. Some people think it's a 90s thing; others report seeing it as early as the 1960s. There were theories that it was the symbol of some 80s hair-metal band. Other people thought it was the original emblem for the clothing brand Stussy. Others thought it was an incarnation of the Superman logo. No one was sure.",
			"I thought I'd ask the office.",
			"\"That's the Superman 'S,'\" mused Ben, our in-house graphics guy. I asked him if that meant it was actually from Superman, but he said it wasn't. \"No, I think it's just what kids think when they're drawing it. They really just draw it because it's cool.\"",
			"I got on the phone to DC Comics to find out if they knew anything. According to Benjamin LeClear, who manages the comics library at their studio in Burbank, California, the \"S\" has nothing to do with Superman.",
			"\"It doesn't look like any of the emblems from the old Superman Shield logos,\" he said after rummaging through their collection. \"His 'S' has a lot of open space and almost never connects to itself.\"",
			"LeClear told me he'd become intrigued and, like me, launched his own mini investigation on the web only to turn up nothing. \"I didn't realize what a crazy urban myth and mystery this pointy 'S' thing is,\" he said. \"I would love for this to be Superman-related, but I don't think it is. Though Superman has the most famous 'S' symbol of all time.\"",
			"\"It's the Stussy 'S,'\" exclaimed Ramona, one of our producers. Like Ben's guess, she didn't think it was actually an emblem associated with Stussy, but refused to believe it had any other name. \"It's definitely called the Stussy 'S,'\" she said, then drew her own version that wasn't as good as mine.",
			"Pretty much every forum on the web mentions Stussy—the Californian surf/street-wear company founded in the 80s. A lot of people seem convinced the symbol was originally a Stussy logo, so I called Stussy.",
			"\"No, this is not an original Stussy Logo,\" stated Emmy Coates, who has worked alongside Shawn Stussy since 1985. \"I personally get asked this a lot, but people have been drawing this 'S' long before Stussy was established. People have just assumed it was Stussy, and it's sort of spread from there. It's actually quite amusing.\"",
			"I finally asked Coates what she thought the symbol looked like. \"It looks like Suzuki logo,\" she replied.",
			"I was tempted to call Suzuki but didn't. I needed to zoom out and take in the bigger picture, so I got in touch with an expert in symbols and semiotics: Paul Cobley.",
			"Cobley is a professor in language and media at Middlesex University in London. According to him, the theory that it was a hair-metal symbol was also ridiculous—\"It's certainly not the Saxon logo,\" he said. \"Theirs was far more sharp and had a staff.\" Then he offered the most likely yet bland explanation of all. That is, it's fun to draw.",
			"\"The reason kids go through this is probably because it's a Moebius strip ,\" he said, referring to the sort of looped one-surface shapes M. C. Escher was fond of drawing. \"It can't be drawn continuously, but it does have a perpetual flow.\"",
			"Moebius strip. I think he was onto something. Most nine-year-olds can't draw, so when someone hands them a magical recipe to create something fairly cool on demand, that'll go viral. Especially when the shape has the sophisticated, mathematical lineage of a Moebius strip. Yes I'd learned the term ten minutes earlier, but whatever.",
			"The \"S\" isn't a Stussy logo or a Superman emblem or a gift from aliens. I think it's just the most fun ever."

			"Cyprus is the cheapest option for a last-minute February half-term getaway, new research has shown.",
			"Paphos, on the island's west coast, and also one of 2017’s two European Capitals of Culture, ranked first in an analysis of package holiday prices and on-the-ground costs in 10 popular winter sun destinations. ",
			"The research conducted by the Post Office calculated the cost of a February half-term package holiday for two adults and two children, along with eight essential holiday purchases spread, including seven bottles of beer, 14 cups of coffee, and seven three-course family meals.",
			"Cyprus, \"a land for romantics, dotted with castles, churches, monasteries, mosaics, white-sand beaches and the bluest of seas\", according to our expert, Fiona Hardcastle, beat Lanzarote to first place. The former recorded overall costs of £1,131, next to the latter’s £1,664.",
			"In third place was Cancun in Mexico, with all the items costing £2,106, the only destination in the top five not to use the euro. The Mexican peso is the only currency weaker against the pound than a year ago in the research, with Britons receiving around 2.5 per cent more for their money.",
			"\"Sterling’s recent rally means that holidaymakers will not have to dig quite so far into their pockets as they would have had to do a few weeks ago,\" explained the Post Office’s Andrew Brown.",
			"\"However, there are big difference in prices among winter sun resorts and these can really have an impact on the overall holiday budget.\"",
			"The more expensive destinations in the ranking were all long-haul, with Jumeirah in Dubai, the dearest, with overall costs of £3,266. In ninth place was Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic (£2,791); in eighth was Penang in Malaysia (£2,382).",
			"\"Bargain-hunters will be well advised to add the cost of meals and drinks in resorts to the price of a holiday package to find the destination that will give them the best overall value,\" added Brown.",
			"\"In places like Dubai where meal and drinks prices are high, booking all-inclusive packages will keep their costs down.\"",
			"Last month, the Post Office’s annual global holiday costs barometer rated the Algarve in Portugal, once again, as the cheapest place in the world for a summer holiday. It pipped Bulgaria’s Sunny Beach to the top spot."

			"LONDON, Sept 30 - Google, which has been grilled twice in the past year by a UK parliamentary committee over its tax practices, had a UK tax bill of 35 million pounds ($55 million) in 2012, on sales of $4.9 billion to British customers, its accounts showed.",
			"The Internet search giant paid a tax rate of 2.6 percent on $8.1 billion in non-U.S. income in 2012, because it channelled almost all of its overseas profits to a subsidiary in Bermuda which levies no corporate income tax, the group's accounts show.",
			"Corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the international agenda in the past year with the G20 and G8 groups of leading economies promising to get to grips with the growing practice of companies diverting profits from where they are earned and into tax havens.",
			"Google said it follows all tax rules in every country where it operates and that it does not pay much tax in Britain because its profits are not generated by its UK employees.",
			"Google UK Ltd, and other subsidiaries across mainland Europe, pay little tax because they are designated as providers of marketing services to Google Ireland Ltd, the Dublin-based subsidiary whose name appears on invoices to most non-U.S. clients.",
			"Google declares little profit in Ireland because the unit there sends almost all of the profit earned from the non-U.S. clients to the Bermudan affiliate, in the form of licence fees for the use of Google intellectual property.",
			"The parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) grilled Google's Northern Europe boss, Matt Brittin, in May after a Reuters investigation showed the company had advertised dozens of jobs for salespeople, despite Brittin telling the committee last year that the company does not pay tax on its UK revenues because it does not conduct sales from British territory.",
			"A PAC report later accused of Google of using \"contrived\" mechanisms to avoid tax and called on the government to change the rules on taxing multinational companies.",
			"Google's Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said attempts to force technology companies to pay more tax could stymie innovation.",
			"Google's UK tax charge on 2012 income was only 11.6 million pounds, with 24 million being payable in relation to employee share based remuneration. (Editing by Louise Ireland)"

			"Among the greatest feelings in the world are the amazing feeling of becoming a dad. The feeling of being able to bring in a new life into this world is totally overwhelming. Most of the times, even big and strong men can’t help but get emotional once they see their babies for the very first time.",
			"When it comes to fatherly excitement, one man from Canada can say that he felt more than any other dad-to-be in the world. He was waiting to see not only his first baby but five! His heart was filled with desire and excitement to kiss and hold his Quintuplets. But when the most awaited day of his life came, he had never prepared for the news that hit him so hard in the face.",
			"The Father-To-Be",
			"Paul Servat is a man in his mid-thirties. He was living in Montreal with his family and friends. Due to his busy schedule, he never realized that he was growing old.",
			"Looking at his friends happy and content with their own families, Paul had realized he wanted to build a family of his own. He was at the height of his career, fit and healthy and he knew that it’s time for him to look for his other half. Of course, there’s an accessible place to do so.",
			"A Whirlwind Romance",
			"At the age of technology, Paul had easily found his match on a dating site. It was 2013 when a woman named Barbara Bienvenue caught his attention. He was two years her junior and he can easily make her laugh.",
			"At their age, there was no time for long courtship. After a few weeks of chatting with each other, they decided to meet in Montreal. The two clicked together and they started dating. Soon enough, the whirlwind romance had blossomed into something else.",
			"A Sudden But Delightful News",
			"Barely two months after dating exclusively, Barbara called Paul and told him that she had something to say. As they were only at the earliest stage of their relationship, Paul had no idea what his girlfriend would say.",
			"When they met, Barbara was smiling from ear to ear. And when she told him the good news, there was a quick moment of shock for Paul. But when the news synced in, a big grin formed on his face as well. At last, he’s going to be a father!",
			"The Whole Neighborhood Rejoiced",
			"Paul was swept away by the news. Just a few months ago, he had longed to build a family of his own. Before he knew it, all that he ever prayed was being handed to him. He couldn’t be any happier.",
			"When his family and friends found out about the good news, they all felt happy for the couple. They even held a celebration to express how much delighted they are for what was happening in their lives. From that day on, the excited father-to-be began his countdown.",
			"Additional Blessings",
			"Additional Blessings",
			"As weeks passed by, the couple began to notice that Barbara’s tummy was unusually big. Realizing they might be expecting twins, Barbara went to undergo checkup and when she returned, Paul couldn’t help but jump for joy. They are going to have more than one child, and even more than two. In the begining Paul couldn't believe it, but they were going to have no less than five children!",
			"They Must Be Prepared",
			"Barbara was one of the lucky women in the world who had conceived quintuplets. Paul couldn’t believe his ears at first. Unlike his friends who had fathered children in their twenties, he was past his prime of becoming a father. But when it was finally given to him, he had it big time! However, there also came his worries.",
			"Paul was earning an average income. It was enough to start a family but wouldn’t be sufficient for five. Lucky for them, they had family, friends, and neighbors who were more than willing to lend a helping hand. The preparation for the quintuplets’ arrival has begun.",
			"Setting Up a Facebook Page",
			"Since the inception of social media platforms, getting help had never been easier. With the help of his friends and co-workers, Paul had set up a Facebook page. He shared their story and used the page to document Barbara’s pregnancy. From his personal to professional contacts, Paul humbly asked for sponsorships.",
			"Aside from their neighbors, help from the local businesses in their community had arrived. To be able to show how grateful they are, they took photos of the gifts and posted them on the Facebook page. They want everyone to know that their efforts are paying off.",
			"Healthy Pregnancy",
			"With each passing day, Paul grew more and more excited. He was always on Barbara’s side whenever she asked for something. He had been so patient of her mood swings and was careful to her like she’s a baby herself. He never wanted anything bad to happen to the mother of his children.",
			"So that Barbara wouldn’t get bored in the house, they started arranging the room of their babies. It was such an unforgettable moment for Paul and he felt younger than ever. If only he could, he would pull the days. But for the meantime, he had to be patient. As they say, all good things are worth the wait.",
			"Moments to Cherish",
			"All throughout the waiting ordeal, Paul felt extremely happy. Even the happiness of his parents who are longing for grandchildren was evident. Her mother was always with Barbara, assisting her in her needs whenever he’s away.",
			"Aside from updating the generous people on Facebook, Paul and Barbara had solemn moments as well. His girlfriend had given him the opportunity to pick the names for their babies and he deeply appreciates it. A month before the due date, Paul was confident that they were ready.",
			"The Time Has Come",
			"Barbara was on her 34th week when it happened. She was hysterical as she told Paul that her water broke. Usually, a full-term pregnancy consists of 37 weeks. It was his first time to deal with this kind of situation. However, he knew from his research that he needed to stay calm.",
			"As fast as he could, he prepared the things and took his girlfriend to the hospital. His family accompanied them as well. Finally, the most awaited day of his life has arrived.",
			"Necessary Precautions",
			"When they arrived at the hospital, the doctors attended to Barbara right away. Since she was not yet in the pain of labor, the necessary processes were done. She was checked up and the doctor performed an ultrasound.",
			"Paul was nervous and excited at the same time. He was waiting outside for great news. When the doctor finally went out, Paul was quite surprised at the expression on his face. He’s looking confused. Could there be a problem with the babies? His heart skipped a beat.",
			"Misunderstanding and Confusion",
			"Judging by the frown on his face, Paul can sense that something was wrong. The staff nurses were clearly uneasy as well. He can’t wait for answers any longer. He approached the doctor.",
			"Paul was then taken aside. The doctor was unsure where to start. Perhaps he was even contemplating on the fact that he discovered. Then, like a sword, his words hit Paul’s heart and mind.",
			"What Went Wrong?",
			"In his excitement, Paul had a hard time accepting what the doctor was saying. His girlfriend was still inside the emergency room. His family was around him, all were eagerly waiting for Barbara’s safe delivery.",
			"However, the doctor was explaining there were no babies to expect at all. Barbara was not pregnant in the first place. For the love of God, Paul couldn’t understand what was happening. How on Earth could this happen?",
			"Seeing the Signs",
			"For almost nine months, Paul had been with Barbara. He saw her belly grew and he was there when her morning sickness was on its height. She was starting to make milk as well. Even his mom had never sensed that there’s something weird that’s going on.",
			"Then like a clap of thunder, it hit him. He was never there when Barbara went to the clinic for checkups. At first, she told him they were expecting twins. Then the next time it became triplets. The following she told her she was carrying four babies. Then it became five. Paul was beginning to feel like a fool. It was then that the doctor told her about Barbara’s condition.",
			"Shocked and Stunned",
			"After months of joy, excitement, thrill, and preparations, Paul was shocked to the core. They were living under one roof and he never had the slightest idea that Barbara was faking her pregnancy. He saw the signs with his own eyes.",
			"From time to time, they took photos and uploaded them on their Facebook page in hopes of getting sponsorship. No one close to them had even suspected that there was no baby at all. At that moment, he became unsure whether there was someone close to them who had the idea that Barbara was lying all along. And then there was one.",
			"A Woman’s Skepticism",
			"Genevieve Laflamme is the first person to sense that something weird was happening. She recently gave birth to triplets. Although she had some suspicions in her mind, she just can’t barge in and tell Paul. He was too happy and excited.",
			"Instead of trusting her intuition, she just convinced herself to believe that Barbara was indeed carrying quintuplets. Moreover, she provided her with tips on where they can get financial support. Genevieve even connected Paul and Barbara to the generous folks who sponsored the diapers for her triplets. Upon learning the news, she quite regretted her decision of keeping silent about her suspicions.",
			"Living with Lies",
			"Paul was not the only one who was brokenhearted with the news. His parents, relatives, and friends were all shocked as well. Even the friend who helped him set up the Facebook page for sponsorship couldn’t help but get annoyed and disappointed with all of Barbara’s lies.",
			"He was so in love and caught up with the idea of becoming a father. He couldn’t think of any reason why the woman she loved and trusted with all his heart would make a fool out of him. Then he found out it was not the first time.",
			"Family’s Knowledge",
			"During their brief relationship, Paul never had the chance to ask Barbara about her family. All that he knew about his girlfriend was that she was from Quebec as well. Barbara didn’t want to talk about her relatives so he respected her silence.",
			"When the hoax came out, a relative of Barbara came forward and told Paul that it was not the first time Barbara fooled people. She had long cut ties with them because of her unusual behavior. They were devastated to know that she did again.",
			"Lies in the Past",
			"The relative, who didn’t want to mention his name, told Paul that Barbara had an ex-boyfriend in the past who suffered the same fate as him. She told the man that she was pregnant with twins. Like Paul, the ex-couple had raised funds to prepare for the coming of the babies. But in the end, Barbara’s lies were exposed as well.",
			"When Barbara left her hometown, the relatives were pretty sure she will never live in lies again. Her honor had been compromised and she promised them that she will lead a better life. But did Barbara really deserve to be condemned or was she a victim as well.",
			"What Barbara Really Needs",
			"Although Paul was angry at the deception, his family had talked to him about how to handle his emotions. The doctors were empathetic. In his mind, he was thinking about the friends and sponsors that are all waiting for their announcement. He had plenty of explanations to do.",
			"At the hospital, the doctor talked about phantom pregnancy. Based on the explanation, what happened wasn’t totally under Barbara’s control. The woman he loved needs deeper understanding. Moreover, she needs medical attention.",
			"What is Phantom Pregnancy?",
			"Pseudocyesis or commonly known as phantom pregnancy is a condition wherein a woman convinces herself that she’s actually pregnant. It’s easy to fall trap as the signs and symptoms of a real pregnancy can be seen and experienced.",
			"According to WebMD, the exact cause of phantom pregnancy is yet unknown. However, they have found out that the extreme desire of a woman to become pregnant is one of the psychological factors. It even causes changes in the body. This condition is really hard to differentiate from real pregnancy."

			"Most successful businesses operate by following a fundamental set of core values. Their vision and mission statement reflect these values, the day to day operations are driven by them and they dictate how major decisions are made. Having core values provides a clarity that fosters focus and makes prioritizing easy.",
			"As human beings, we all have a personal set of core values that reflect the essence of who we are. We all have them. However having them and consciously allowing them to guide you through life are two entirely different things. Understanding and living a life driven by your own personal values is one of the major keys to success, happiness and inner peace.",
			"Write it out",
			"The first step in living a life full of purpose and passion is to write down your own personal values. Your values, though tied to your morals and ethics are not a system of right or wrong. Your personal values are the things you value the most. What drives you? What makes you feel alive, energized and invigorated? Is it love, family, money, career, popularity, serving others, social justice, rescuing animals? The list goes on and on. What do you love? What matters to you?",
			"Now that you have identified them–write them down.",
			"Why? Research shows that writing down your values yields dozens of positive results such as:",

			"who you truly are. You will begin to manage your time better. You will learn to make better choices about where you spend your time.",
			"about where you spend your time. Knowing and being true to what really matters to you will ignite your passion for your purpose and being able to fulfill your purpose fuels that passion even more. The two are interdependent and keep you motivated and moving forward.",
			"Our values are like our internal compass. They keep us headed toward our true north. When we get off course, having them written down helps us notice sooner. Writing about our values helps remind us of where we need to be and it helps us get back on track more easily.",
			"Our values are our roots that keep us grounded in what’s important to us. Having them written down visually reminds us to stay true to who we really are.",
			"In short, discovering, defining, writing down and living your core values helps to ensure that you get more of the right things done and makes the journey so much more enjoyable.",
			"Seeing your personal values in writing reduces stress",
			"Dr. Kelly McGonigal, Stanford Professor and author of the book The Upside of Stress, has studied the impact that connecting our personal values to our experiences–specifically journaling about the connection–has on our overall health, well-being and ability to cope with stress. According to Dr. McGonigal’s research there are life altering benefits to writing about our personal values:",

			"The summer's 1st real rom-com's about abortion and fart jokes"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Romantic comedies have become so rare that when the trailer for \"What If\" with Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan premiered last week, Vulture's Amanda Dobbins wrote, \"It looks like someone actually made a rom-com in 2014?\" Indeed, a genre that produced some of the most loved films of all-time -- anything written by Nora Ephron, for instance -- has all but disappeared from the multiplex. This is the world that \"Obvious Child\" enters into on Friday, following six successful months on the festival circuit.",
			"\"It is 100 percent made to be a romantic comedy,\" director Gillian Robespierre told HuffPost Entertainment when asked if she would consider her new film part of Hollywood's once-favored genre. \"That's a genre I love, and we just took that style -- boy meets girl -- and put a little twist on it. We messed it up a little bit. I hope people call it a romantic comedy, and I'm proud to have it called that.\"",
			"Robespierre \"messed it up a little bit\" by focusing her love story on a stand-up comic named Donna (Jenny Slate) who has a one-night stand, gets pregnant and decides to have an abortion. According to Robespierre, \"Obvious Child\" -- which was first a 2009 short film that also starred Slate -- was created as an answer to films such as \"Knocked Up\" and \"Juno,\" where unexpected pregnancies led to new families. \"They just didn’t feel true,\" Robespierre told the New York Times in a recent interview.",
			"\"I'm so neurotic that I'm sure there's backlash out there,\" the director said about her film, which debuted at this year's Sundance Film Festival to near-universal praise. \"Not just from the right, but from people who think scatological jokes are lowbrow or unintelligent and everyone who makes them are boring neanderthals. But! Those people are not fun people. Farts are funny. I think you're kind of a robot if you don't think so. You don't have to love the movie, but you have to love a fart sound.\"",
			"Robespierre has such a fondness for fart sounds that she includes one in her movie's meet-cute: Donna's one-night stand, Max (Jake Lacy from \"The Office\"), accidentally farts in her direction while she's squatting to pee in the street. (It later earns him the nickname \"Pee Farter.\")",
			"\"I like our movie because I think that it's satisfying in the way that traditional rom-coms are satisfying, but that it's storyline is just more modern and less squeaky clean,\" Slate said. \"But it's not trying to be shocking.\"",
			"Slate, 32, is best known for her one-season stint on \"Saturday Night Live,\" guest appearances on \"Bored to Death\" and \"Parks and Recreation\" and Marcel The Shell, a short film that she made with her now-husband, Dean Fleisher-Camp. (According to the actress, plans are still in motion for a Marcel feature film, though nothing is set in stone.) Like Donna, she's a stand-up comic in real life, often performing in Brooklyn.",
			"\"When we saw her on stage, before we started working on the short, we felt like she was saying what was going on in our head,\" Robespierre said of finding her lead actress. \"She was so funny and charming, and also beautiful and wearing dresses and very feminine. She was saying everything we thought, and always have been thinking, about our bodies and families and life. It was one of those moments where you wanted her to either be in a movie or be your best friend.\"",
			"Playing a stand-up comic was not necessarily difficult for Slate, but she and Robespierre made sure that Donna had her own style.",
			"\"She doesn't realize that she doesn't have to put everything out there,\" Slate said. \"She doesn't realize she's spraying the area and some people don't want to be sprayed. But it's also satisfying for her to put everything out there.\"",
			"Robespierre structures \"Obvious Child\" around three stand-up routines. The first introduces Donna and her openness with jokes about her then-boyfriend and life views in general. (She is pro-farting, as it turns out.) The second is more of a meltdown, with Donna lashing out after being dumped. The third happens the night before her scheduled abortion procedure.",
			"\"That to me was totally alien to me. I wouldn't do that,\" Slate said of the final performance, where Donna reveals to an audience of mostly strangers that she's having an abortion. \"I might do it after the fact. But, in general, I tend to not bring up subjects that seem like hot-button issues in my standup. Because I feel like I have too much of my own personal shit to sort out first, and I don't feel that I'm up for it. I don't feel I have anything very funny to say about big issues. For Donna, she's not talking about a big issue. She's talking about herself. So that I relate to. I relate to her understanding that it is in her nature to be confessional. Her nature is not going to change, even though she has to go through a big experience.\"",
			"Slate has been praised for her performance in \"Obvious Child,\" though the plaudits have come in two different forms: Depending on the publication, she's either enjoying a breakout moment or her comeback.",
			"\"I don't even think about those things at all. I'm grateful that people are writing about the movie, but I don't walk around with a clear narrative of myself,\" Slate said of the opposing media designations placed upon her this year. \"I literally just think about myself day by day. It sucks in a way, because I don't want to be labeled as someone. To me, it's not that simple. [...] I can only do my shit.\""

			"Does student debt derail young people from the American dream of owning a home? That depends on which headline you click.",
			"So what’s really going on here? The findings of the two studies don’t exactly contradict — one finds that student loan borrowers say they’re delaying buying a home because of their payments and the other notes that young people with college debt are more likely to buy a home than those who never went to college. But the way the research is framed may change the way we view the results, said Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at Demos, a left-leaning think tank.",
			"\"There are important reasons to look at homeownership and what’s happening among young households because it’s still the greatest opportunity to generate wealth that young people have,\" he said. \"But what I find frustrating about the debate around student debt and homeownership is that it looks at only two binary variables: Whether you have student debt and whether you own a home. The debate assumes that if it’s not having an impact on homeownership, it’s not having an impact at all.\"",
			"It’s hard to deny that the debt is having an impact, given the rising cost of a college degree combined with stagnating wages over the past several years, Huelsman said. Student debt is It’s hard to deny that the debt is having an impact, given the rising cost of a college degree combined with stagnating wages over the past several years, Huelsman said. Student debt is making it more difficult to save for retirement, research from his organization found. Still, he understands where the obsession with student debt on homeownership comes from. \"People tend to look at homeownership as a marker of economic health,\" he said.",
			"The idea that student loans may be putting young people at risk of missing such an important economic milestone draws attention in large part because it raises the question as to whether skipping college is a smart financial decision. But it’s not the act of going to college that makes it more difficult to buy a home — it’s the debt. And in fact, for those who complete college, buying a home is easier than for high school graduates, even with the debt that comes with the degree. By age 35, somewhere between 40 and 50% of college graduates own homes, regardless of whether they took on debt to attend school, compared with roughly 30% of those without a degree, a recent The idea that student loans may be putting young people at risk of missing such an important economic milestone draws attention in large part because it raises the question as to whether skipping college is a smart financial decision.

His organization Discussions of rising student debt and its consequences \"always begs the question, does this mean that people should skip college?\" said John Zurick, the president of SALT, a program that helps borrowers better manage their student debt. His organization has found that student debt does delay major life decisions like homeownership. \"But for us the resounding answer is no, you should not skip college.\" Instead students should be mindful of the cost and the amount they’re borrowing when choosing a school, he said.",
			"While today’s college graduates may have a more difficult time saving for a home than their parents and grandparents—who were less likely to have to worry about student loan payments—there are other reasons why they could be delaying homebuying, said Svenja Gudell, the chief economist at real estate website, Zillow. Fewer than 40% of Americans under 35 own a home, compared with more than 60% of Americans overall, While today’s college graduates may have a more difficult time saving for a home than their parents and grandparents—who were less likely to have to worry about student loan payments—there are other reasons why they could be delaying homebuying, said Svenja Gudell, the chief economist at real estate website, Zillow. Fewer than 40% of Americans under 35 own a home, compared with more than 60% of Americans overall, according to census data . The average age of first-time home buyers also ticked up over the past several decades; in the 1970s, the median age of a first-time home buyer was 29 or 30, according to Zillow . Today, it’s roughly 32.",
			"High rents in major cities mean that many millennials don’t have extra money to put aside, she said. And even those young people who do have the funds set aside may find themselves priced out. \"You’re just having a hard time finding a home that is affordable for millennials, especially in these areas where the job market is going really well,\" Gudell said. \"You see these markets that have a fair amount of good jobs that also have a fair amount of wage growth; their inventory is so tight that you’re having trouble finding an affordable home.\"",
			"All of this is to say that the financial lives of young people are complicated in part because of student debt and so it’s hard to say exactly why 20-somethings are pushing the goal posts forward on this economic milestone. \"There are so many things going on in terms of how people are building their own family finances to the extent that they can, that to just look at two pieces of that — student debt and the choice to buy a home — it’s incomplete,\" Huelsman said."

			"Why you shouldn't drive slowly in the left lane"
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"There are basically two types of drivers: those who get worked up about people driving slowly in the left lane, and those who do it all the time and have no idea they're upsetting everyone else.",
			"In case you're in the second group, some background: every state has some sort of law that discourages people from traveling in the left lane on multi-lane roads and highways. It's not that you're never allowed in the left lane, just that you should only use it when necessary, for passing, then get back over.",
			"That's because even if you're driving fast, there's always someone going faster. If you promptly get back over after passing, that car will be able to pass you, allowing everyone on the road to get to their destinations as quickly as possible. If you don't, it'll inevitably lead to buildups of traffic and likely raise the chance of accidents.",
			"The system works best when people aren't hogging the left lane. That's one reason why National Motorists Association has declared June Lane Courtesy Month in an effort to to raise awareness about the importance of getting out of the left lane.",
			"State laws restrict driving in the left lane",
			"Every state has some law on the books restricting use of the left lane. In 29 states (shown in yellow), the law says any car that's moving slower than the \"normal speed of traffic\" should be in the right lane — so even if it's going at the speed limit, a car that's not moving as fast as the other cars around shouldn't be in the left. Georgia has increased the penalty for violating this law to a misdemeanor.",
			"In 11 states (shown in green), the laws are even stricter — specifically saying the left lane is only for turning or passing. Most of the remaining states say cars need to get over if they're blocking traffic that wants to pass, or if they're traveling more slowly than the speed limit.",
			"Police are cracking down on left lane drivers",
			"Traditionally, these laws have seldom been enforced, and were often just used as a legal excuse for police to pull people over for unrelated reasons. ",
			"Recently, though, police in several states — including Washington, Texas, and Ohio — have increasingly been issuing tickets to people they spot traveling slowly in the left.",
			"It impedes traffic and probably makes everyone less safe",
			"There's a certain rationale for these laws and enforcement campaigns. When drivers travel in the left lane, it makes the road more congested and probably more dangerous for all parties involved.",
			"Research shows that many traffic jams result from a surprisingly small number of slow cars obstructing traffic, with their effects rippling outward. A small buildup of cars that can't pass because someone is driving slowly in the left — right next to another car traveling slowly in the right — is the exact type of scenario that can start this cascade of traffic.",
			"Now, some people counter that as long as they're going the speed limit, they don't have to move over — and by slowing down would-be speeders, they're making the roads safer.",
			"Apart from the fact that in 44 states, simply going the speed limit doesn't permit drivers to travel in the left lane, this argument doesn't make a lot of sense based on research into how accidents occur.",
			"Unfortunately, there isn't much research on the effect of impeding people from passing in the left lane specifically. But there is evidence that slowing down and changing lanes is more dangerous than speeding.",
			"Lanes changes account for about four percent of all car accidents in the US, and perhaps as much as ten percent of accidents on highways. Meanwhile, research has generally shown that the strongest predictor of an accident isn't speeding, but variance from the average speed of traffic — and a car going five miles per hour slower than the surrounding traffic has a greater chance of causing an accident than one going five miles per hour faster than it.",
			"If relatively slow drivers are scattered among the right and left lanes, faster drivers have to repeatedly slow down and weave back and forth, changing lanes many times to pass all of them. If the slower drivers are all driving in the right lane, a faster driver can pass several at a time, then get back into the right, cutting down on the total number of lane changes and eliminating the slow downs.",
			"There's even some evidence that this is why accident and fatality rates are so much lower on the German autobahn, compared to US interstates, even though speed limits are higher (or in some places nonexistent) in Germany. Lane discipline is much more strictly maintained there, allowing drivers to travel more safely at faster speeds."

			"Six lessons from the godfather of California cuisine"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"When asked to describe the current state of California cuisine, chef Daniel Patterson replies with a simple, \"I don't think I'm qualified to answer that.\"",
			"Modest words from someone who has been lauded as \"a leading force in California cuisine\" and \"the man single-handedly reinventing California cuisine,\" and whose food has been revered as \"a signature cerebral brand of California cuisine.\"",
			"Whether he chooses to embrace these accolades or not, Patterson's cooking undoubtedly embodies the very best of California cooking, fusing fresh and seasonal local treasures with innovative preparations and presentations. The proprietor of San Francisco's double-Michelin-starred Coi shows the figs-on-a-plate crowd who's boss, transforming ingredients into the very best versions of themselves: asparagus blanched in asparagus water, strawberries coated in a strawberry glaze.",
			"And his influence continues to expand throughout the Bay Area and the world. Alongside the enduring popularity of Coi and his handful of restaurants in downtown Oakland, Patterson's first-ever cookbook, the aptly titled \"Coi: Stories and Recipes,\" comes out this month (he's also an avid food writer, and the book features original essays that accompany dozens of recipes). The newest addition to Patterson's ever-expanding empire will be the \"very casual\" Alta CA, slated to open in San Francisco's burgeoning Mid-Market neighborhood later this year.",
			"The Huffington Post recently caught up with Patterson to see if we could glean any morsels of wisdom from the self-taught chef and father of two. Herewith, a few lessons from an icon most certainly qualified to discuss the state of California cuisine and beyond.",
			"Patterson, right, preparing food in Madrid.",
			"1) Eat your veggies. Coi's evolving tasting menu is often vegetable-centric, a testament to the flavor complexity of plants. \"It's how we like to cook; it's how I like to eat,\" Patterson says, adding that Northern California is known for its produce. \"We have extraordinary vegetables here ... it's more challenging and ultimately rewarding for me to work with products that have a much greater range of flavor.\"",
			"2) Enjoy said veggies a few weeks after their season starts. \"We won't take things at the beginning of the season,\" Patterson, who sources his menu from a wide range of \"the very best\" foragers and producers in the Bay Area, explains. \"We wait until they are at peak flavor.\"",
			"3) Ingredients dictate everything. The dishes on Patterson's menus take shape only after he and his team know exactly which ingredients they'll be using. \"We mostly focus on what tastes good,\" he says. \"We'll let the ingredients talk a little bit, figure out where they want to go at any given time.\"",
			"4) Don't serve complex foods to your 4-year-old. When asked if he feeds his son dishes from the Coi menu, Patterson responds with, \"Hell no!\" At home, he says, he focuses on simple meals. \"We have a slow cooker,\" he says. \"I'll roast a chicken, throw the bones in with some water. Add some vegetables, take the bones out, put in some beans, turn that into dinner with some greens.\"",
			"5) You can succeed without a mentor. Patterson never attended culinary school or worked under a renowned chef, instead opting to open his first restaurant in Sonoma at the age of 25. \"I was able to start cooking and figure out what my style was without any preconceived ideas,\" he says. \"At the same time, I think it took me a lot longer to figure things out than it would have if I’d worked under a mentor. That would have been great, too -- there are pros and cons to both.\"",
			"6) It's no fun to play favorites. \"My favorite dish is always the next one I'm working on,\" Patterson says."

			"By Jeff Russell, B. Comm., MA Published : September 13, 2016",
			"Which Is the Fastest Growing Economy in 2017?",
			"When the discussion comes to naming the fastest-growing economy in the world, China seems to always be under the spotlight. But there’s a whole other world out there, full of countries that are also undergoing explosive growth. You may even be surprised to learn that China doesn’t top the fastest-growing economies list.",
			"The following list of the fastest-growing economies in the world is based on 2017 growth projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). (Source: \"World Economic Outlook October 2016,\" International Monetary Fund, last accessed October 5, 2016.)",
			"Take a look at our list of the top 10 fastest-growing emerging economies in the world.",
			"10. Nigeria",
			"2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 0.6%",
			"Nigeria is Africa’s largest country and economy, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of about $490.0 billion in 2015. The country is rich in resources, especially oil, but it is moving toward a service sector economy. In 2014, the country reached a record GDP of $568.51 billion, when the service sector contributed 57% to Nigeria’s growth.",
			"As the country is reliant on oil, its economy has faced some scrutiny.",
			"But if you look at the long term, Nigeria’s growth has been simply amazing. Over the past decade, Nigeria’s government has made economic reforms to accelerate growth. From 2000 to 2012, Nigeria’s GDP per capita has roughly doubled, from about $1,400 per person to about $2,800 per person.",
			"9. Colombia",
			"2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 2.7%",
			"Colombia is one of the biggest economic hubs in Latin America. Petroleum is the country’s main export, accounting for about 45% of total exports.",
			"Colombia’s government has made sound economic policies and has aggressively made free trade agreements in recent years to stimulate economic growth.",
			"Growth in 2014 was 4.4%. Sadly, low oil prices have impacted the growth rate for the country. Its long-term outlook remains solid regardless.",
			"8. Turkey",
			"2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 3.0%",
			"Turkey’s free market economy is increasingly driven by its industry and service sectors, although employment in agriculture still accounts for about 25% of its workforce.",
			"The country’s government has recently undergone steps to privatize institutions and reduce state involvement in basic industry, banking, transport, and communication.",
			"The emerging middle class is adding vigor to the economy and helping to expand production beyond the traditional textile and clothing sectors.",
			"7. Romania",
			"2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 3.8%",
			"Romania joined the European Union in 2007 and has since made considerable economic reforms to its institutions to align it with a market economy and stimulate economic growth. Domestic consumption and foreign direct investment have helped drive that growth.",
			"Romania has a diversified economy, but its service sector is growing, accounting for about 52% of GDP, while agriculture and industry accounts for 12% and 36% of GDP, respectively.",
			"Poverty used to be a huge problem for Romania, but the country’s explosive economic growth has greatly alleviated it.",
			"6. Egypt",
			"2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 4.0%",
			"Since 2000, Egypt’s government underwent economic reforms to attract foreign direct investment and spur economic growth. The reforms and policies helped Egypt’s economy grow at a rate of eight percent annually between 2004 and 2009.",
			"Egypt’s growth rate over the past decade has taken a hit since the 2011 revolution. The country’s government faces numerous challenges as to how to get back up to past growth rates by restoring market and investor confidence. Regardless, the country continues to accelerate at a decent pace.",
			"5. Pakistan",
			"2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 5.0%",
			"Pakistan is currently liberalizing its economy, including privatization of all government corporations, with the goal of attracting foreign direct investment.",
			"About 40% of the country’s population is employed in the agricultural sector, but economic growth is being led by foreign direct investment and the services sector.",
			"Pakistan has made substantial reductions in poverty. It fell from 35% in 2002 to about 13.6% in 2011. With a solid growth rate expected going forward, it wouldn’t be shocking to see the poverty rate decline further.",
			"4. Indonesia",
			"2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 5.3%",
			"Indonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia and the 16th largest economy in the world. Even though economic growth has slowed down in recent years, the country’s growth is still outputting impressive numbers.",
			"Gross national income per capita has grown aggressively since 2000. In 2000, GDP per capita was $560.00, rising to $3,650.00 in 2014.",
			"Indonesia has also made great strides toward reducing poverty, more than halving the poverty rate to 11.2% in 2014.",
			"Indonesia is in the third phase of a 20-year development plan that will focus on infrastructure development, education, and healthcare. These, along with foreign direct investment, will be the main drivers of growth.",
			"3. China",
			"2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 6.2%",
			"Since the 1970s, China’s government has reformed its economy from a closed, centrally planned system to more of an open market-oriented one. The restructuring of the economy and reforms have led to an over-tenfold increase in GDP since 1978.",
			"In 2010, China became the world’s largest exporter, as it has become a manufacturing powerhouse. Over the past two years, there’s been a significant amount of noise that suggests that China’s headed toward a slowdown. Despite this, the country continues to register phenomenal growth rates.",

			"Dear Liz,",
			"I am in a happy state of shock because I have two job offers at the same time! I am a recent follower of your job search advice. I've used three pieces of your advice in my job search and that's how I got the two job offers I'm considering now.",
			"I was job-hunting for six months and I didn't get even one interview during that time. I completed over 100 online job applications. Even as I was filling out the forms I felt that it was a helpless, useless process. All of the online applications are the same, no matter which company you apply to work for.",
			"They all want to know how long you worked at each job and they all ask about your Tasks and Duties. Isn't it obvious from your job title what your Tasks and Duties in the job were?",
			"When I started to read your columns I stopped completing online job applications and I started writing Pain Letters instead. I sent out six Pain Letters at first and I got two replies.",
			"One was a very nice email from a hiring manager who isn't looking for any help right now (I had not seen a job ad from her company, but I thought the company sounded interesting) and the other reply came from the HR Director in a second company where I'd sent a Pain Letter to the hiring manager.",
			"The HR Director, Paula, said that the hiring manager I had reached with my Pain Letter didn't have any job openings but two other managers did. I interviewed with Paula's company and met both managers, and that's where my first job offer came from. The second job offer came from my third batch of Pain Letters.",
			"All in all I have sent out seventeen Pain Letters now, I've had six job interviews and I've got two job offers to decide between. I think I am going to take the offer at Paula's company because the people there were both extremely smart and very nice during the entire interview process.",
			"I think the culture is healthier there than it is in the other company where I have a job offer. It's a great company too, but why not work in the healthiest place possible?",
			"I am 34 years old and I was raised to follow rules. I guess most people were. I have never broken rules  before the way I did in this job search. I guess anybody who got one of my Pain Letters and didn't like it didn't respond to me, and that's perfectly fine.",
			"Here are three major pieces of your advice that I followed:",
			"I stopped applying for jobs online, and started sending Pain Letters and my Human-Voiced Resume directly to hiring managers, instead. Along the way I got a lot better at using LinkedIn to conduct research!",
			"The Definitive Careers Guide From Forbes encompasses every aspect of the job hunt, from interview to promotion. Discover how to get ahead today.",
			"I got a consulting business card and started to give it out at networking events. I haven't had any consulting projects yet but I've grown my network a lot and I've also grown my confidence.",
			"I stopped being so shy and timid at interviews. No one is going to know what I can do for them unless I tell them. I used my LinkedIn research to get inside the heads of each of my hiring managers, and I'm sure that's why I have two job offers now.",
			"The managers who did get back to me weren't the least bit bothered by my direct approach to them. They were glad. They said that it's really  hard to find people to fill their positions. I figured that was true but because we hear so much about talent shortages you start to think that your skills are a dime a dozen.",
			"Now I know that's not true. Thanks for your encouragement, Liz! I don't expect to go back to rule-following in my job search for a long time, if ever. I know that CEOs and other executives don't fill out online job application forms, so why should I?",

A Legend of course, the epitome of clean cut American optimism, dancing with Gene Kelly as an equal, a warrior woman who never stopped working. A devoted mother and grandmother, and aunt and great aunt, and friend. I lost my mom a few years ago. She loved that Debbie was my TV mom. I hope they find each other and hug and kiss and my mom says, \"I got you, Debbie. Carrie's waiting for you.\" RIP Bobbie Adler. ❤"

			"THE BIG FAILURE THAT HILLARY KEPT SECRET FOR 30 YEARS"
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"The first time Bill Clinton proposed to Hillary Rodham was at twilight in England’s romantic Lake District in the spring of 1973. She declined.",
			"The couple had recently graduated from Yale Law School and were at a crossroads in their two-year relationship. While the spurned Bill returned home to teach at the University of Arkansas and prepare to run for office, Hillary moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and rented a room near Harvard to study for the bar exam and begin work for Marian Wright Edelman at the Children’s Defense Fund.",
			"Hillary loved Bill but could not imagine herself making a life in his home state of Arkansas . Though she had grander ambitions, she still felt pulled in two directions. And then she got a nudge in what proved to be the right direction from an unexpected source: the biggest failure of her young life — one that she kept secret from friends and the public for 30 years, and that would have historic implications as well.",
			"The sky was the limit, or perhaps Arkansas was.",
			"Like her Rhodes scholar boyfriend, Hillary had been a politically minded overachiever for years. The Illinois native and former Goldwater girl had become a Democrat at Wellesley College during the late 1960s and enjoyed her first taste of national fame when she delivered the commencement address at the school’s graduation — one of several student addresses featured in the June 1969 issue of Life magazine. After Yale, the sky was the limit, or perhaps Arkansas was.",
			"As legendary Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein chronicles in A Woman in Charge, there were plenty of reasons for Hillary to avoid Arkansas. For one, moving there would mean she’d likely have to take a teaching job like Bill or work at a local law firm — not exactly her life’s ambition . Her friends thought she was crazy to even consider it, and Bill’s mother, Virginia, who had met Hillary in New Haven, was not a big fan of hers. Bill had always dated flashier women, including a former Miss Arkansas, and Virginia was not convinced that Ms. Rodham was good enough for her son.",
			"But after Hillary rejected his proposal in England, Bill was able to talk her into visiting Arkansas that summer ... and into taking the Arkansas bar exam. Still, when Bill and Hillary parted after her brief stay in Arkansas, Bernstein writes, \"their situation seemed totally unsettled.\"",
			"After sitting for the Arkansas bar exam, Hillary, along with 816 other aspiring lawyers, took the District of Columbia’s bar exam in July 1973. Passing that test was the No. 1 prerequisite to securing a decent legal job in the nation’s capital. Hillary then started her job at the Children’s Defense Fund, which she loved. Living alone in Cambridge, and without Bill, was hard, though. Hillary spent most of her salary, she later admitted, on telephone calls. \"Despite the satisfaction of my work,\" Clinton reflects in her autobiography, Living History, \"I was lonely and missed Bill more than I could stand.\"",
			"Then, in early November, Hillary received shocking news: She had failed the D.C. bar exam. A full two-thirds of the test’s takers had passed, many of them with a far less impressive educational pedigree than hers. \"For the first time in her life, she had flamed out,\" writes Bernstein, \"spectacularly, given the expectations of others for her.\"",
			"The future Mrs. Clinton was hardly the first person, or future leader, to fail a major examination. A Harvard Law School grad, and future first lady, named Michelle Robinson, failed her first attempt to pass the Illinois bar exam. Two future California governors, Pete Wilson and Jerry Brown, fared no better with the California bar. Winston Churchill famously failed the entrance examination to Britain’s elite Sandhurst military academy ... twice.",
			"\"[M]y heart was pulling me toward Arkansas,\" Clinton reflects in Living History. \"When I learned that I passed in Arkansas but failed in D.C., I thought maybe my test scores were telling me something.\" Northeastern University professor Daniel Urman doubts that the failure was a \"deal breaker\" for her move to Arkansas and that Clinton’s reading it as a sign probably stems in part from a \"motivated retelling of history.\" Still, it’s hard not to conjecture what turn her life — and history — might have taken had she passed the D.C. exam.",
			"A few weeks after the bad news, Bill came to visit Hillary in Boston and the two spent time exploring the city and planning their future. He had rented a small house on 80 secluded acres outside of Fayetteville and was eager for her to join him. Which she did, taking up her own post at the University of Arkansas in 1974 after several months in D.C. working on the Senate’s impeachment inquiry staff tied to the ongoing Watergate scandal. In 1975, she finally said yes to a subsequent proposal from Bill, and the two were married in Fayetteville. Hillary would keep her exam failure hidden, however, even from close friends, for the next three decades until she mentioned it, almost in passing, in Living History. The bottom line, as she would write: \"I knew I was always happier with Bill than without him.\""

			"Although much attention has focused on concussions in high school sports, shoulder injuries are common as well. And these injuries may vary by sport.",
			"A recent study found that football had the highest rate of shoulder injuries among high school students.",
			"The high school sport with the lowest rate of shoulder injuries was girls' soccer.",
			"Less than one in 10 high school students needed surgery for their injuries, and almost half returned to play within a week of their injury.",
			"This study, led by T. Walker Robinson, MD, MPH, of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, investigated shoulder injuries among US high school athletes.",
			"The researchers collected data about nine sports from a group of 100 nationally representative high schools for the school years ranging from 2005-2006 through 2011-2012.",
			"The sports included boys' football, soccer, basketball, wrestling and baseball, as well as girls' soccer, volleyball, basketball and softball.",
			"The researchers looked at the rate of shoulder injuries among the total number of \"athletic exposures,\" defined as a single athlete participating in a single practice or game.",
			"To qualify as a shoulder injury, it had to occur as a result of the sport, require attention by a trainer or doctor and either be a fracture and/or result in the athlete having to sit out at least one day from the sport.",
			"Out of a little more than 13 million athlete exposures, a total of 2,798 shoulder injuries were reported during the six-year study period. This number translated to approximately 2.15 shoulder injuries sustained for every 10,000 athlete exposures, which matches up with the approximately 820,700 shoulder injuries reported nationwide during this time period.",
			"The athletes experienced shoulder injuries three times more often during games and competitions than during practices.",
			"The sport with the highest rate of injuries was boys' football (almost five injuries per 10,000 exposures), while the lowest was girls' soccer (about 0.5 injuries per 10,000 exposures).",
			"Only about 8 percent of the injuries required surgery, with almost two thirds of the injuries being either a strain/sprain or a dislocation/separation.",
			"About 40 percent of the injured athletes experienced a strain or sprain, and 29 percent experienced a dislocation or separation.",
			"While only about 8 percent of the injured athletes ended up having to sit out the season (or their high school career) as a result of their injuries, about 41 percent returned to play within a week.",
			"\"Continued prospective surveillance is necessary to monitor injury rates, to gain further information about risk factors leading to shoulder injuries, and ultimately to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based interventions to prevent future shoulder injuries,\" the researchers wrote.",
			"This study was published January 13 in the journal Pediatrics. The authors reported no potential conflicts of interest.",
			"The research was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Federation of State High School Association, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, DonJoy Orthotics and EyeBlack."

		"targetParagraphs": [
			"It has been decades since beloved American actor and performer Dick Van Dyke has endorsed a presidential candidate. He’s coming out of the shadows now, though, to endorse Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. In an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, Van Dyke discussed his new book, sang a song from \"Mary Poppins\" and, yes, shared his support for Sanders.",
			"Many people have criticized Bernie Sanders’ supporters, describing them as entitled millennials. Critics don’t realize, though, that it is not just the young who want Bernie in office. He appeals to people of all demographics, including 90 year-old men like Dick Van Dyke.",
			"Van Dyke started by saying that he is not one to frequently get involved in politics. However, Bernie Sanders, with his vision for America, seems to have brought him back into the political sphere. \"Well, I haven’t campaigned since Eugene McCarthy, so you know how political I am, but I’m 90 degrees — 90 years old so I like to give a hand to young aspiring politicians like Bernie.\" He continued:",
			"‘Bernie has lit a fire that’s been lit a hundred times over the last hundred years but always got sidelined or squelched, but somehow, Bernie has caught the eye and minds of young people and I think this time it’s going to happen.’",
			"He went on to discuss the importance of having a president like Sanders, saying, \"We’ve got to put him in the White House. He goes back to Woodrow Wilson who said there was an invisible force over and above the United States government. The banks and the insurance companies, and it’s been going on that long. Ike warned us, and even Jimmy Carter warned us of what was happening.\"",
			"Perhaps the most important thing that Dick Van Dyke has said about Bernie Sanders did not come up on MSNBC, though, but rather on his personal YouTube channel, where he shared a video a few days ago declaring his support for Sanders. In the video, he said:",
			"‘In Bernie Sanders I see a man saying that the emperor has no clothes, while everyone around him insists they see clothes. Whether or not he makes it to the White House, I hope and pray that everyone hears the alarm he is sounding now, it may be the last voice we ever hear.’"

		"targetParagraphs": [
			"As if actress and all-around feminist superwoman Rashida Jones hadn't already turned us into hardcore tween fan-girls, the \"Parks And Recreation\" star's most recent comments have us seriously swooning. The Harvard grad sat down with The Guardian's Hadley Freeman to discuss her final farewell to \"Parks And Rec,\" funny women in Hollywood and the \"full princess fantasy.\"",
			"After allegations of \"slut-shaming\" Hollywood actresses during an October 2013 Twitter debacle, Jones clarified and expanded on her perception of a \"pornification\" of pop culture in a column for Glamour magazine. This week, the actress told The Guardian: \"I'm just asking people to take a breath and talk about it. I also wanted to say there's more than one way to be a woman and be sexy -- like, you're a really great dancer, or you're really f**king smart.\"",
			"I had the full princess fantasy: the white horse, the whole being saved from my life, which is ridiculous. What do I want to be saved from? My life's great! But it's just this weird thing that's been hammered into my head culturally: that's the only way to succeed, that's the only thing that counts for a woman. I'm happy, but the fact that I'm not married and don't have kids – it's taken me a long time to get to a place where I actually am OK with that, where I actually don't feel like I'm some sort of loser.",
			"Jones also discussed her frustration with the value put on marriage as an achievement for women -- and how she overcame the narrative that women can't be happy without it:",
			"While Jones has had to defend some of her positions, there's no question she is committed to women's equality -- if not superiority, as she quipped (but seriously though...) to The Conversation in 2013: \"I do think because women are so clever and flexible and such good communicators, it's been hard for men to evolve and keep up. I think we could do a little better to help them out.\"",
			"We definitely agree that a woman can be sexy in many more ways than just her appearance. Keep preachin', Rashida."

			"The California city of San Rafael might be one of the more beautiful places in the country, but if you’re a smoker, it might not be the place for you.",
			"Last week, the San Francisco suburb made active a smoking ban that officials say is the strictest in the country, prohibiting smoking cigarettes in your own home.",
			"The ordinance specifically bans smoking in dwellings that share a wall with another unit, including apartments, duplexes and condominiums. The hope is to eliminate second-hand smoke from creeping through doors and windows, ventilation systems, floorboards and other susceptible openings. According to a U.S. Surgeon General report, secondhand smoke kills about 50,000 Americans per year, including 430 infants.",
			"The San Rafael City Council unanimously approved the ban last year.",
			"\"I'm not aware of any ordinance that's stronger,\" said Rebecca Woodbury, an analyst at the City Manager’s office, to ABC. \"It doesn't matter if it's owner-occupied or renter-occupied. We didn't want to discriminate. The distinguishing feature is the shared wall.\"",
			"While California outlawed smoking in bars, clubs and restaurants in 1995, the San Rafael ban is the first to move the restrictions inside the home -- a move that the American Lung Association called \"groundbreaking.\"",
			"\"This legislation will improve the health of all Californians by reducing exposure to smoke that drifts into housing units from balconies, patios, and other units,\" said the association's president and CEO, Jane Warner.",
			"But not everyone celebrated the move.",
			"\"This...smoking ban actually intends to punish people for what they do in their own homes,\" said San Rafael resident Thomas Ruppenthal to the council. \"I really feel this is tyranny.\"",
			"Some housing advocates also spoke out against the ban, claiming that it targeted low-income earners, The Sacramento Bee reported:",
			"Brian Augusta, of the Western Center on Law and Poverty, said that targeting multifamily units disproportionately affects low-income people who can't afford standalone homes.",
			"\"If smoking is an addiction, and it clearly is, are we telling people that they have to quit smoking - without support - or leave their homes?\" he said.",
			"In the same article, Kimberly Amazeen of the American Lung Association offered a rebuttal.",
			"\"The real discrimination is against low-income families who can't escape exposure to deadly secondhand smoke,\" she said, \"and they can't find another place to live because of their income or health.\""

			"It may get you out the house and running around.",
			"But Pokemon Go opens up a whole other world of health problems, doctors warn.",
			"The game sends users running around streets and parks all over the world trying to catch virtual Pokémon with their cell phone cameras.",
			"It uses Google Maps to create a world that mirrors the user's own reality.",
			"As a result, with their eyes glued to the virtual map on their screen, scores of users have been failing to look out for real life dangers.",
			"One user in California tweeted an x-ray showing he broke his collarbone on the day of the game's release. Others have sprained their ankles, suffered blistering sunburn, and become neurotic about racking up as many Pokemon as they can.",
			"For all the millions of people addicted to Pokemon Go, there's good news: it could be your new workout",
			"One user in California tweeted an x-ray showing he broke his collarbone on the day of the game's release",
			"One user posted a photo of a huge bruise on their leg, writing: 'My first pokemon go injury lmao. My depth perceptionless ass walked into a bench corner.'",
			"Another said: 'Is there such thing as a Pokemon Go hangover? Because I think I have one. Sunburnt neck, sore feet, and 0 Pokeballs in my inventory.'",
			"And one wrote: 'My brother went to catch a Pokémon and ended up with a sprained ankle.'",
			"From blisters and sunburn to pulled muscles and eye strain, medical professionals have given Daily Mail Online a run-down of the ways to stay safe while trying to catch 'em all.",
			"1. SUNBURN",
			"The release of Pokemon Go has coincided with a sweltering heat wave in the US and the UK.",
			"That hasn't stopped users pounding the streets.",
			"But Joshua Zeichner, Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mt Sinai Hospital, has offered Daily Mail Online some tips to avoid skin damage while playing.",
			"Wear sunscreen",
			"'Apply a nickel sized dollop for your face and reapply every two hours or immediately after heavy sweating,' Dr Zeichner, an American Academy of Dermatology affiliate, advises.",
			"'Wear sun protective clothing, broad brimmed hats and sunglasses for additional protection.'",
			"No matter how easily you burn, wear sunscreen with a broad spectrum coverage that has at least SPF 30 protection, he says.",
			"No matter how easily you burn, wear sunscreen with a broad spectrum coverage that has at least SPF 30",
			"Stay out of the sun",
			"And if possible, avoid the sun during peak hours of 10am and 2pm, or even 4pm.",
			"Treating sunburn",
			"If your Pokemon-catching escapades do lead to a burn, Dr Zeichner advises applying a milk compress with a washcloth soaked in skim milk and ice cubes.",
			"Proteins in the milk coat and soothe the skin, he explains.",
			"Keep the skin hydrated using a aloe based moisturizer, and apply one per cent hydrocortisone ointment twice daily.",
			"If there is pain or any blisters, visit your Dermatologist for a prescription regimen.",
			"'It doesn't matter if you are sitting at the beach or running around playing Pokemon Go, you are exposed to UV light from the sun just the same,' Dr Zeichner advised.",
			"'Follow the same tips while playing Pokemon Go as you would otherwise when you are out in the sun.'",
			"2. SKIN DAMAGE - FROM YOUR SCREEN",
			"You can suffer long-term damage from UVB rays reflected off your phone screens, The American Academy of Dermatology warns",
			"Dr Zeichner also warns about another kind of skin damage: the eroding effect your phone screen has on your face.",
			"A recent article published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatologists outlined the long-term damage of reflected UVB rays which come from phone screens.",
			"'If you are outside on your phone or tablet, UV light can reflect from the screen directly to your face.'",
			"He advises limiting the amount of time spent looking at your screen.",
			"3. BLISTERS",
			"According to Anthony Rossi, assistant professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College, the key to beating blisters is prevention.",
			"Protect your feet",
			"Wear nylon or moisture-wicking socks - not cotton.",
			"If wearing one pair of socks doesn't help, try wearing two pairs to protect your skin.",
			"You should also make sure your shoes fit properly. Shoes shouldn't be too tight or too loose.",
			"Wear the right clothing",
			"During physical activity, wear moisture-wicking, loose-fitting clothes.",
			"Avoid clothes made of cotton, as cotton soaks up sweat and moisture, which can lead to friction and chafing.",
			"According to Anthony Rossi, assistant professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College, the key to beating blisters is prevention",
			"Try bandages",
			"For problem areas, such as the feet or thighs, consider using adhesive moleskin or other soft bandages. Make sure the bandages are applied securely.",
			"Problem areas? Try powder or petroleum jelly",
			"This helps reduce friction when your skin rubs together or rubs against clothing.",
			"Know when to stop",
			"Stop your activity immediately if you experience pain or discomfort, or if your skin turns red: Otherwise, you may get a blister.",
			"'If you do get a blister, be patient and try to leave it alone,' said Dr. Rossi.",
			"'Most blisters heal on their own in one to two weeks. Don't resume the activity that caused your blister until it's healed.'",
			"4. SPRAINS, FRACTURES, BROKEN BONES",
			"Responding to the reports, the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons has issued official guidance on how to stay safe while playing.",
			"'We love that these games are bringing children and adults outdoors and encouraging exercise,' Dr Alan Hilibrand said.",
			"'But we also want everyone to be mindful of their surroundings as they enjoy this activity.",
			"'Walking while looking at your phone or electronic device can result in sprains, broken bones, and other serious, even fatal, injuries.'",
			"As people pelt about the streets, they aren't looking around them - leaving them open to accidents",
			"Traffic",
			"Keep your eyes on your surroundings instead of your phone when you cross into traffic or enter an intersection.",
			"Be careful when you cross streets and wait for a traffic light if possible.",
			"Watch for cars and bikes.",
			"Look up",
			"When you reach a curb, look up. Don't look down. Use the same level of caution when you're in the middle of intersections.",
			"Watch out for other people",
			"Stop and get out of the way of other pedestrians if you need to use your cellphone or talk to the person next to you.",
			"Listen",
			"If you're wearing headphones, set the volume low enough so you can still hear traffic and things around you.",
			"5. MENTAL HEALTH",
			"People who are certified as addicts display a level of behavioral issues that severely impact on their life and the people around them. Many psychologists warn games like Pokemon Go can have such an affect",
			"Following its release, psychologists rushed to praise the benefits of Pokemon Go, helping people to get outside and interact.",
			"But many have also warned that the game is incredibly addictive, fueling other kinds of mental health issues.",
			"The American Society of Addiction Medication describes addiction as 'a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry.'",
			"People who are certified as addicts - to a substance or activity - display a level of behavioral issues that severely impact on their life and the people around them.",
			"The slogan for Pokemon Go ('Gotta catch 'em all!') has turned the app into the most popular game on Android and almost the most popular game on iOS in just one week.",
			"If you're playing at work, playing instead of socializing, playing until you fall asleep, and playing as soon as you wake up, that can be classed as verging into the realm of addiction.",
			"Experts advise setting an alarm to limit your time on the game, making plans with friends that don't involve your phone, and leaving your phone charger at home."

			"T he radical terrorist group ISIS has decided to ban women from wearing burkas, but not because of equal rights or a new position on the role of women.",
			"In a humiliating turn, ISIS can’t have women wearing the veil in security offices in Mosul, Iraq, because it endangers their security, the Daily Mirror reports.",
			"An insider explained to the Al Alam News Network that a series of deadly attacks on terror groups were carried out by women wearing burkas and niqabs over the last few months. Women will still be required to cover themselves while accompanying ISIS in public. Their restrictions are even more strict, requiring women to wear gauze to cover their eyes and gloves to cover the skin on their hands.",
			"The terrorists have also banned smoking, dancing, watching any foreign television, and the internet."

			"Is a rare birth defect actually helping American breaststrokers?"
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"RIO DE JANEIRO — The old swimming adage is that breaststrokers are born, not made. You often can look at a swimmer standing still and tell whether they are a natural fit for the most esoteric of the four strokes.",
			"Start from the ground up: Most successful breaststrokers have duck feet that point outward, making it all the easier to perform the frog kick that goes with the stroke. Flexible ankles are a plus. So is a long torso.",
			"But what if there is one other rare physical trait that lends itself to excellence in breaststroke? And what if that trait is a birth defect?",
			"It sounds crazy, and it might be nothing more than coincidence. But two of the three American Olympic breaststrokers here were born with a chest wall deformity, and a third elite American breaststroker has the same physical abnormality.",
			"Kevin Cordes, who was a finalist in the 100 breast earlier this week and finished eighth in the 200 breast final Wednesday night, has a condition known as pectus carinatum. It is characterized by a protrusion of the sternum and ribs.",
			"Cordes is, essentially, pigeon-chested. He had surgery in third grade to mitigate the appearance of it, leaving him more numb in the lower sternum.",
			"Teammate Cody Miller , the bronze medalist in the 100 breast, has the inverse effect: pectus excavatum. That’s a sunken chest, where the ribs and sternum have grown inward.",
			"Sam Tierney, an All-American at Missouri who was a semifinalist in both the 100 and 200 breast at Olympic trials, also was born with pectus excavatum. Tierney had surgery in high school to expand his chest, wherein doctors inserted a metal bar for two years.",
			"So that’s 66 percent of the American Olympic breaststroke crew, and 37.5 percent of the top eight male breaststrokers in the country, if you go by their top times over the last year. Research estimates that 0.2 percent of live births have the same condition as Miller and Tierney, and 0.006 percent have Cordes’ condition.",
			"Those are striking percentages. Again, it could be mere coincidence. But as Cordes said when I pointed it out, \"That’s crazy.\"",
			"I asked all three athletes if there could be a correlation – if perhaps the chest shape contributes to the physics of successful breaststroke. Cordes said he didn’t know. Miller was doubtful. Tierney was more open to the idea.",
			"For all three, the chest-wall issues were (or are) a cardiovascular challenge. Miller and Tierney said their lung capacity and stamina were inhibited. Tierney’s surgery alleviated that issue, while Miller (who has not had a corrective surgery) has simply overcome it.",
			"\"I think I’d be a better breaststroker with a normal chest,\" Miller said.",
			"Certainly so, from an aerobic standpoint. But what about stroke mechanics?",
			"I’m particularly thinking about the pull, which brings water into the chest as the hands come together beneath the body. Could there be a benefit in a slightly misshapen chest creating something of a spout for that displaced water to go?",
			"Tierney pointed out that he, like many swimmers and particularly breaststrokers, has poor posture. His shoulders come forward and chest is down, a common physical trait in swimmers due to greater muscle mass on the front of the torso – it essentially pulls the shoulder into a slouch. That’s also a common posture profile of someone with pectus excavatum.",
			"\"That’s what breaststroke pull is,\" Tierney said. \"Your shoulders are coming forward while your chest is in.\"",
			"Miller, a student of the stroke who has observed Cordes’ technique for years, sees another physiological characteristic that might help his American teammate.",
			"\"His ability to hold his body line in water has more to do with his scoliosis,\" Miller said. \"You can very easily see his arched back. That helps his body line, which allows him to bring his heels up and have curvature of his torso.\"",
			"That’s part of what makes breaststroke different – it is an undulation stroke that is all about rhythm and mechanics and flow, and less about pure speed and power."

			"New research finds two-thirds of millennials plan to leave their current organization by 2020. One-quarter see themselves elsewhere within the next year.",
			"While you could argue that young workers have always been inclined to job hop (and millennials are less inclined to do so), their reasons for restlessness may have changed.",
			"Young workers' latest gripe? Insufficient opportunities to develop their leadership skills.",
			"That's according to the fifth annual Global Millennials survey, cited on Bloomberg, for which Deloitte reached out to nearly 7,700 working college-educated professionals in 29 countries.",
			"As many as 63% of respondents said their leadership skills are not being fully developed.",
			"And it seems to be a key reason behind their willingness to leave: While 71% of those likely to leave in the next two years are dissatisfied with how their leadership skills are being developed, that number drops to 54% among those who are planning to stay beyond 2020.",
			"As Punit Renjen, chief executive officer of Deloitte Global, told Bloomberg, young workers' pursuit of leadership skills even at the expense of switching jobs is a new phenomenon.",
			"Perhaps it has something to do with the recent trend of flattening organizations, which was highlighted in The Washington Post. In an effort to cut costs, organizations have removed levels of bureaucracy, which means there's not much of a corporate ladder to climb anymore.",
			"\"The biggest driver of disengagement is people feeling like they're stuck in a job, and there's nothing for them there,\" one expert told The Post. \"It's easier to quit your company and find a new job than find a new job within your own company.\"",
			"Restoring some semblance of a corporate ladder may require a good deal of structural reorganization. In the meantime, managers can take small steps to help their employees develop into leadership positions.",
			"The Wall Street Journal recommends creating mentoring programs in which workers are paired with more senior employees at their company. You can also rotate your employees through different jobs, so they gain new knowledge and expertise.",
			"As for individual employees, US News & World Report suggests being proactive instead of waiting for a leadership position to open up.",
			"If you work for a large company, you can speak to someone in human resources and ask what you should be learning to reach the next level. You can also volunteer to take charge of a particular project, so that management recognizes your capabilities."

			"One often discussed question is whether it’s better to keep your laptop plugged in, or if you should use it on battery power.",
			"Turns out, the answer isn’t entirely straightforward. Let’s take a look.",
			"Know Your Laptop Battery",
			"For both types of batteries, the following statements are true (for modern laptops ):",
			"A battery cannot be overcharged. There’s no danger of a battery being overcharged if you leave it plugged in all the time. As soon as it hits 100%, it will cease charging and won’t start again until the voltage falls below a certain level.",
			"There’s no danger of a battery being overcharged if you leave it plugged in all the time. As soon as it hits 100%, it will cease charging and won’t start again until the voltage falls below a certain level. Fully discharging a battery will damage it. Having a battery fully discharged for an extended period can put it into a deep discharge state, from which it might never recover.",
			"So, based on this, do we conclude that you should simply leave your laptop plugged in all the time? Not quite.",
			"Things That Damage Lithium Batteries",
			"Charge/discharge cycles. Every battery has a finite number of times it can be charged and discharged.",
			"Every battery has a finite number of times it can be charged and discharged. Voltage level. The higher the charge level (measured in volts per cell), the shorter the battery’s life.",
			"The higher the charge level (measured in volts per cell), the shorter the battery’s life. High temperature, over 30 degrees celsius. This can cause irreparable damage.",
			"Charge Level",
			"Lithium-ion batteries charge to 4.20V/cell, which amounts to 100% of its capacity. At this level, the battery will have a lifespan of 300-500 discharge cycles.",
			"Every 0.10V/cell reduction in the charge doubles the number of discharge cycles, until the optimum is reached: 3.92V/cell, with 2400-4000 discharge cycles. Unfortunately, at this level the battery is only 58% charged, so the runtime will be little more than half of a fully-charged battery.",
			"Heat",
			"And then there’s heat. Elevated temperatures, typically classified as being over 30 degrees celsius, will shorten the life of a battery irrespective of any other factors. Simply leaving your laptop in your car on a summer’s afternoon is a bad idea.",
			"When the stress of high temperature combines with the stress of high voltage, the effects are even greater.",
			"The Battery University tests showed that a battery stored with a 40% charge at 40 degrees would see its capacity fall to 85% after a year.",
			"Charged to 100% the capacity falls to 65% under the same conditions. For a fully charged battery at 60 degrees the capacity plummets to 60% in just three months.",
			"The evidence seems clear. Keeping the battery permanently charged at 100% will slowly shorten its life. Keeping it at 100% and exposing it to high temperatures will shorten it much quicker.",
			"Should You Remove The Battery?",
			"If heat is such a danger, it begs another question. Should you remove the battery altogether when using your laptop on AC power?",
			"If you do choose to remove the battery, ensure that you store it properly. This means charged to between 40% and 70%, and kept at room temperature.",
			"Recommendations",
			"Curiously, the industry as a whole doesn’t seem to have settled on a single answer for the question about whether to use your laptop on AC or battery power.",
			"Apple’s advice is no longer on its website, but you can still read it online . The company recommends against leaving a laptop plugged in all the time. Instead, it suggests:",
			"An ideal user would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing",
			"Leaving your laptop plugged in will not cause short term damage, but if you only ever use it on AC power you’ll almost certainly find that after a year the battery’s capacity has been significantly reduced. Similarly, if you only ever use it on battery power you’ll get through the battery’s discharge cycles quicker.",
			"So, the best solution is something of a compromise between the two: use it on battery power some days, and keep it plugged in on others. And in all cases, you’ll want to ensure it doesn’t get too hot.",
			"How do you use your laptop? What steps do you take to keep your battery lasting for as long as possible? Let us know in the comments.",

			"Fast Weight Loss Tricks",
			"The first step of anything new is always the hardest – but the most rewarding. Once you’ve started with something, it’s easier to know where you’re going and this is especially true with weight loss. Here are our top eleven weight loss strategies that can help you start your weight loss journey.",
			"1. Cut Out Fizzy Drinks",
			"Seriously – this is one of the easiest ways to start dropping off the pounds. Whilst each individual bottle might not contain that many calories, the tendency to drink it in large quantities adds up. Try swapping out fizzy drinks for just plain water – and if you simply must have something more, swap to something like a fresh fruit smoothie. Avoiding the calories gained through fizzy drinks – even the diet version – can be a nice simple start, and a good foundation to build on. After all, it’s much easier to swap out fizzy drinks than change your whole diet, and it’s much harder to find yourself snacking guiltily on them!",
			"2. Have 5 Small Meals a Day",
			"This may seem counter-intuitive, but it makes sense when you think about it. On a standard three meals a day diet, you may find yourself getting hungry in-between meal times, and that’s when the snacking starts. No matter how healthy your main meals, snacking is one of the quickest ways to pile on the pounds. Instead of having three large meals a day, try swapping to five small ones. This should reduce your hunger, helping you to have more control over what you eat and avoiding filling up on snacks!",
			"3. Eat Breakfast",
			"As part of the above, try to make sure you eat breakfast. It’s for exactly the same reasons – while you may think eating more will make you gain weight, it won’t if you’re in control. Instead, eating breakfast means you can avoid snacking in the morning and it can help you keep the pounds off!",
			"4. Swap Coffee/Tea for Green Tea",
			"Coffee and tea aren’t particularly big in the weight gain category, but they are an easy thing to swap out. For that reason, we suggest swapping them out for green tea, which has links to weight loss and helps keep you healthy due to the sheer amount of antioxidants in it. It may not help you lose weight by itself, but as a first step it’s good practice for swapping out parts of your daily routine and it’s got a useful support effect to any other changes you might make. You could also take green tea supplements if you preferred.",
			"5. Make Use of Supplements",
			"One of the hardest parts of exercising is feeling too tired to even start. If you have this problem, have a look at your diet and what you might be missing. Many people don’t get enough vitamin C, D and E, and it may be worth adding supplements of these to see if it perks you up. Another possibility is a lack of iron, but in this case you should check with a doctor before taking supplements just in case. Not only will taking vitamin C, D and E supplements help you feel more alert and up for exercise, but it’ll also keep your skin clear and healthy and help your body fix any damage exercising might do.",
			"6. Find Some Friends",
			"Everything is easier with friends, and losing weight is no different. Having people to talk to who’ll understand the problems you’ve encountered, and to give their own tips, is great. Whether it’s work colleagues, a support group like weight-watchers, or just a group at the local gym, getting some weight loss friends is a great first step.",
			"7. Keep a Food Diary",
			"Keep a food diary for a few weeks before starting your diet, and use it to work out your weak points. This strategy of targeting particular issues rather than just reducing intake generally means you’re more likely to success as you’ll have clear goals. Plus if you keep up a food diary once you’ve started you can keep an eye on where you struggle and where you do best!",
			"8. Accept Mistakes",
			"One of the most common thing new starters to weight loss do is to make a mistake, panic, give up and binge eat. Come to terms in advance with the idea there will be bad days, and try not to feel guilty for it. It’s okay to have an off day once in a while, so long as you get back up and try again the day after. Learning that mistakes are okay and not to give up is vital.",
			"9. Hide Your Scales",
			"Checking the scales everyday can be off-putting and make you feel like you’re barely attaining anything. Get a trusted friend to hide your scales from you and only check them on a set schedule – every two weeks perhaps. This will help prevent you getting hung up on numbers and instead focus on how your body feels and looks. Remember: if you’re doing exercise, muscle is denser than fat, so numbers aren’t everything.",
			"10. Learn to Cook Some Key Meals",
			"Pick out three key, healthy meals that you can easily cook and spend time perfecting them. Cooking your own meals means you’ll have more control over what’s in them, and it can also help you get used to proportions. Definitely worth spending time on!",
			"11. Decide One Exercise Per Day",
			"Starting to exercise is hard, so pick on key exercise and try to do it for ten minutes every day. Whether this is standing push-ups, squats or even just a quick jog, dedicating ten minutes to a single exercise everyday is a great way to get going, and you’ll soon find your motivation for doing more increases!"

			"You know orange juice has a lot of sugar -- 21 grams in one small cup -- but is it worse than a cola?",
			"1. The dark secret in your glass of sunshine.",
			"When fruit is stripped of its skin, pulp, flesh and other fibrous parts, it's distilled down to its sweet essence. That means that orange juice has roughly the same amount of sugar as the demon of the nutritional world, soda -- about 5 to 8 teaspoons per cup. Add to this: the sugar in pure, natural juice and the sugar in sugar-sweetened beverages are both densely packed with calories, say Naveed Sattar, MD, PhD, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow. In a recent article in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal, Sattar points out that eating whole fruit is associated with a reduced (or neutral) risk of diabetes, but drinking fruit juice is associated with an increased risk.",
			"2. The cold truth.",
			"The marquee vitamin in orange juice, vitamin C, is good for your immune system, and it's an antioxidant that protects cells from free radicals. But some of its benefits are overrated: No studies have been able to conclude that vitamin C helps cure colds. Further, you may not realize that the information on the label of your store-bought juice (even not-from-concentrate brands) refers to the amount of vitamin C that was present when the product was packaged, explains Alissa Hamilton, PhD, a former Food and Society Policy Fellow with the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and the author of Squeezed: What You Don't Know About Orange Juice. All juice loses nutrients over time (that's why the people at the juice bar urge you to drink their blends ASAP), and modern storage technology has radically extended the shelf life of mass-market juices. For example, today’s more efficient mode of storage is to strip the liquid of oxygen and then keep it in million-gallon tanks. The juice can remain in those tanks for upwards of a year. Then after it goes into the carton, it can sit on a truck, in a supermarket, and in your fridge, steadily losing vitamins.",
			"3. The hidden extras.",
			"When juice is processed and treated for storage, it inevitably loses flavor. To remedy this, Hamilton says that big juice manufacturers work with chemical companies to come up with \"flavor packs\" that make the juice taste like the beverage we know and love -- those are added to the juice before it's packaged for sale. The chemicals in the flavor packs are essences and oils found naturally in oranges, but they don't necessarily come from the same oranges that are in that carton of juice. Hamilton discovered that some of the flavor-makers are known to source their ingredients from countries like Brazil, which has different restrictions and pesticide controls than we have in the U.S.",
			"4. The juicy conclusion:",
			"With its links to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and gout and its utter lack of nutrients, soda is still worse for you than orange juice. The problem comes when non-soda drinkers swap out all their fruit or water for juice, an increasingly common diet habit. \"People know that soda is bad for them, but I had one patients in my clinic drinking 2 liters of orange juice a day thinking he was getting all these health benefits, all while gaining weight, causing liver problems and increasing his risk of diabetes,\" says Sattar. He urges people to drink fruit juice sparingly."

			"C’mon, you know you want to be this guy. Image: The American Chemical Society",
			"Imagine if we could be like plants, lying outside all day soaking up sweet, sweet energy from the sun. Doesn’t sound like a bad life, does it? So why aren’t the world’s best minds figuring out how to hack photosynthesis into humans?",
			"It turns out there are a lot of reasons, which are spelled out in a new video by the American Chemical Society. First, there are aesthetics to consider: your cells would have to be packed with light-harvesting pigments called chlorophyll, meaning you’d be bright green, or maybe a custom-tailored shade of red or blue. (Although I’m pretty sure you wouldn’t have ivy sprouting out of your forehead.) But far more problematic than your skin’s unusual hue is the energetics of photosynthesis.",
			"Eating sunlight isn’t all that efficient—plants are only able to put a few percent of the energy packed away in the sun’s rays to work. For your average tree, that translates to about 200 calories a day. The reason our leafy green friends can get by on such a lean diet is that they live a very sedentary lifestyle, so unless you really want to lay in the sun all day and also be braindead, you’d need to supplement your solar meals with a regular intake of cheeseburgers. (Also, your body would still require protein in addition to the sugar you’re producing from photosynthesis, so again, cheeseburgers.)",
			"Finally, plants maximize the amount of energy they can capture by growing their leaves very thin. Your sausage fingers and burrito arms are ill suited for the task, so you’d probably want to scrap them for bionic sail appendages instead. Is this sounding fun or what!",
			"Insurmountable obstacles aside, the idea of hacking photosynthesis into humans has gotten real scientific consideration, and there are animals out there that really do photosynthesize, in a way. So, even though our descendants will never live entirely off the sun, who knows? Maybe distance runners of the future will be able to charge up with a little solar snack now and again.",

		"targetParagraphs": [
			"The smiling poop's ability to transcend language barriers and political differences has seen it become one of the most popular emojis in existence, writes Samantha Selinger-Morris. And its ineffable charm resonates in surprisingly profound ways.",
			"It may sound like a situation ripped from an old Seinfeld script, but it's a social quandary most of us have struggled with, fruitlessly.",
			"It's Christmas, you dip your hand into a hat to select the name of the person to whom you must give a Kris Kringle gift, only to discover it's the office snitch. What can you give them that will convey your distaste, but without you ending up being yanked into the Human Resources office?",
			"Last week, Sydney baker Andres Fatso offered up what she thinks will be the perfect solution: smiling poop emoji cupcakes.",
			"\"You know, [you think], 'You're a little shit sometimes',\" says Ms Fatso, who posted an image of her chocolate cupcakes — massive chocolate icing swirl on top, to resemble the poop, with white and black candy eyes and a smile — on Instagram, where she has more than 35,000 followers.",
			"\"I'm going to give you a shit emoji.'\"",
			"Until fairly recently, one could safely assume that any \"gift\" involving faeces would likely be reciprocated with a slap in the face, or the accusation that you have the emotional maturity of a four-year-old.",
			"But in the past 12 months, the smiling poop emoji has become an unexpectedly beloved icon, among both the young and the not-so-young.",
			"Its ability to ease uncomfortable social interactions — from discussing opposing political opinions to admitting first-world guilt — has seen it proliferate, well, almost everywhere.",
			"Artisans on Etsy now offer everything from earrings to buttons and slippers in the shape of the emoji.",
			"In July, music lovers at the Splendour in the Grass music festival, near Byron Bay, flocked to sit in a giant inflatable smiling pink poop emoji tent, created by a Spanish art collective. (In it, guests were treated to — you guessed it — soft serve chocolate ice-cream that resembles the emoji.)",
			"In September, Indian actress Deepika Padukone was featured in a Vanity Fair magazine spread of hot young talents in which she declared that her most \"overused emoji\" was the smiling poop.",
			"And earlier this year, a couple in Western Australia transformed a termite mound, off the side of a highway they frequently travel on, into a smiling poop emoji, with giant accessories from Kmart.",
			"\"The poop emoji is just the most flexible of all the characters out there,\" says Jeremy Burge, the Australian founder of Emojipedia (a Wikipedia for emojis).",
			"He says it is currently one of the most popular of all the approximately 2,000 emojis in existence, and that he sees it regularly, in the form of a throw cushion, being sold in Tube stations in London, England, where he currently lives.",
			"\"It's a mixed meaning. It's smiling, so it's happy, but it's poop,\" Mr Burge says.",
			"\"You could [mean, by using it], 'This is great'. But, more to the point, you could use it anywhere, and people don't quite know what you mean by it. You can use it in any context.\"",
			"For Lisa Williams, the Torquay-based owner of an Etsy boutique that sells an inflatable foil smiling poop emoji balloon, the emoji is the perfect way to communicate to friends that most modern of messages — that something is a \"first world problem\".",
			"\"If something was a bit crappy, we would use it [in a text], in a joking way; you know, 'We're all fairly lucky, nothing in our lives is that bad',\" says Ms Williams, 38.",
			"It meets an entirely different need for the children and tweens who buy the balloon, however: \"They can sort of say, 'shit', with their poo emoji, without having to use the language, or get in trouble.\"",
			"The emoji similarly enables grown-ups to dodge censorship, says Dr Pauline Bryant, a visiting fellow in the Linguistics Program at the Australian National University, because we can express \"disgust, dislike, disapproval, without having to actually spell out words that might actually get blocked by a [computer] filter\".",
			"\"And there is so much going on in the world that needs a comment like a poo emoji. Political things, and, generally, the state of the world,\" she says.",
			"Indeed, although the emoji was first introduced in 2010, it surged in popularity in the last year, thanks in part to the contentious American presidential election.",
			"Last month, a hacker placed a smiling poop emoji on the front page of American president-elect Donald Trump's website.",
			"It was pulled down quickly, presumably by Mr Trump's staff, but not before the Internet exploded with gleeful headlines. (\"Someone took a shit on Donald Trump's website; Great job, Internet!\" wrote entertainment website AV Club.)",
			"Earlier this year, both Democrats and Republicans rejoiced at the launch of Politicians To Poop, a Chrome browser extension that allows computer users to \"poopify\" the names of both presidential candidates, by replacing all mention of them with the smiling poop emoji.",
			"As online technology magazine CNet.com, put it: \"The smiling poop emoji is the hero the US deserves.\"",
			"And, adds Dr Bryant, the poop emoji is also useful for helping people discuss dissenting political opinions with loved ones, in a text or email, without upsetting them.",
			"\"How can you be mad, or offended, by an emoji that actually looks like soft serve ice cream with big eyes and a smile?\" she says.",
			"The idea of excrement being co-opted to enable the discussion of serious topics can seem counterintuitive. But emojis, in general, have been gaining legitimacy.",
			"Oxford Dictionaries declared — for the first time ever — that the \"word of the year\" for 2015 was a pictograph (the \"Face with Tears Emoji\"). Meanwhile, classic texts like the Bible, and Moby Dick, have been translated into emoji.",
			"And the smiling poop emoji, in particular, was used last year by a serious charity. Water Aid, which raises funds to provide clean water and toilets to the 2.4 billion people who lack them, launched its #GiveAShit campaign, with the poop emoji at its centre.",
			"The charity enlisted celebrities to post a customized smiling poop emoji that resembled them, to their Instagram accounts. (\"Isn't it uncanny?\" actor Allan Cumming wrote, on Instagram, of his poop, which sported round black spectacles and a swoop of grey hair.)",
			"This isn't to say that the emoji is entirely unproblematic. Someone — presumably a critic — tore down the Western Australian smiling poop emoji termite mound after a week.",
			"And, by combining symbols that convey disgust and glee, the emoji can lead to confusion.",
			"Mr Burge recalls being texted a variety of emojis — including the dancing girl, the smiley face, and the smiling poop — after a night out with friends.",
			"\"You kind of go, 'Was that just telling a story about what happened?' You don't really know what they mean by that. Did anything go wrong?\" he says.",
			"Still, for many others, the emoji has an ineffable charm that resonates in surprisingly profound ways.",
			"\"If that poop's not happy, why are you not happy?\" said my eight-year-old daughter, when I asked her why the emoji was so popular.",
			"(Rainn Wilson, the star of the American version of the TV show The Office, feels the same, tweeting in July: \"He's a pile of poo but he still has a smile on his face. He's hanging in there. So can you!\")",
			"\"It is deep, if you think about it,\" says Ms Fatso, the baker, who is also a full-time nurse. She says the smiling poop always puts a smile on her face, and is a welcome contrast to the suffering she sees almost daily.",
			"And, she adds, giving a smiling poop emoji to someone you don't like — in any form — could even shift the relationship in a new, positive direction.",
			"\"It could really turn that relationship around. [The other person] might think, 'They've got humour! They're happy to call me a shit, and they can be honest and up front about it.\""

			"One Rock Legend Really, Really Wants To Be In Guardians Of The Galaxy 3 By Eric Eisenberg Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is still months away from release... but things look pretty damn good for the future of the franchise. The series is easily one of the most popular within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's pretty easy to imagine Marvel working to complete a full trilogy even if the first sequel is a let (which we certainly don't think it will be). As a result, there is already plenty of anticipation for what could wind up being called Guardians of the Galaxy 3 - but the project has picked up interest from one interesting individual in particular: Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. The musician/actor recently had the opportunity to have a sizable role in the new indie horror movie Happy Birthday, and it was while sitting down with People magazine that he revealed his interest in being a part of the Marvel family -- specifically out in the cosmos with writer/director James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy. Discussing his feelings about acting post-Happy Birthday and his potential future as an actor, Steven Tyler said, I hope [audiences] enjoy [Happy Birthday]. I know I did! It made me want to do more movies for sure, I would do anything to be in Guardians of the Galaxy 3 -- are you listening James Gunn? Steven Tyler, as mentioned, is best known as the lead singer of Aerosmith, but he does have some acting experience under his belt. In addition to playing himself in movies like Wayne's World 2 and Be Cool, he's also played legitimate roles -- such as in Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express and Epic. Of course, he's also spent time as an American Idol judge, which is a certain level of performance as well. And let's not forget that Tyler already has a family connection within the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well, as his daughter, Liv Tyler, played Betty Ross in The Incredible Hulk. Regardless of his experience and connections, however, whether or not Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 could actually find room for Steven Tyler is a legitimate question. The first film already had a massive ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, John C. Reilly, Michael Rooker and more, and the upcoming sequel is adding to that group with exciting stars like Kurt Russell and Pom Klementieff. I suppose it's possible that Tyler could wind up being given a small but important part -- like the one that Sylvester Stallone will be playing in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Would you like to see Steven Tyler land a role in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3? Is there a particular part you think he would be well-suited for? Hit the comments section below with your thoughts!

			"Worrying is something we all do now and again, but if your worrying is repetitive, it focuses on hypothetical problems, or it starts to disrupt your life, it could be a sign of something more serious.",
			"Another sign of anxiety is specific, irrational fear. This could be a fear of an object, activity or situation, for example. But this symptom might be harder to spot, because people with phobias tend to form avoidance behaviour. This means you, possibly subconsciously, avoid the phobia, therefore reducing the fear and not realising the severity of the problem.",
			"Sufferers of anxiety are more likely to experience high-arousal states, when the sympathetic nervous system is activated. This puts the body in fight or flight mode, and subconsciously tenses muscles so they're prepared to see off the perceived threat.",
			"The mind and the digestive system are closely linked, and research has found that stress and anxiety can cause digestive problems, such as symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome.",
			"There is a close relationship between sleep and anxiety. If you notice your sleeping patterns change, you find it more difficult to sleep or become more tired, this could be a sign of anxiety. And this can become a vicious cycle; a lack of sleep can contribute to stress and anxiety levels. The mental health charity Mind has some good advice for getting a better night's sleep.",
			"Prolonged anxiety can weaken your immune system, and result in you suffering from more viruses.",
			"Anxiety becomes a disorder when it interferes with your everyday life. It can make it difficult to maintain relationships, to concentrate on something for a prolonged period of time, to hold down a job, and to relax.",

			"These Streetlights Are Great For The Planet — But Horrible For Your Health"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Facebook",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Tree-lined streets, good schools, quiet road and low-intensity streetlights...",
			"That last one may not have made it on your checklist for finding your last home, apartment or condo, but doctors now say it probably should have.",
			"Even though they save energy, some light-emitting diode (or LED) streetlights are too bright and may actually be putting your health and security at risk, according to new recommendations from the American Medical Association, the largest professional association of doctors in the U.S.",
			"The benefits of LED lights include a lot of energy and cost savings. They use up to 50 percent less energy than conventional lights. And the lifetime of LED lights is two to four times that of older, non-LED lights, which means lower maintenance costs for cities that need to change a street’s lightbulbs when they go out.",
			"But the bottom line from the AMA is that high-intensity LED streetlights that emit too much blue light can actually throw off sleep patterns of the people living in those neighborhoods and make nighttime glare on roads worse than conventional lights.",
			"\"Despite the energy efficiency benefits, some LED lights are harmful when used as street lighting,\" Maya A. Babu, an AMA board member, said in press release.",
			"None of the authors of the AMA recommendations were answering questions on the topic, according to the press office.",
			"'A Strip Mall In Outer Space'",
			"\"It feels like I’m in a strip mall in outer space,\" Brooklyn resident Jolanta Benal told The New York Times last year, complaining about the bright LED streetlights in her Windsor Terrace neighborhood.",
			"New York City is spending $75 million to retrofit its more than 250,000 street lights to be energy-efficient LEDs, the Times reported. The new lights are expected to save the city $6 million in energy costs and $8 million in maintenance each year.",
			"But lights like these could also be costing residents like Benal a lot of sleep.",
			"The retrofitted streetlights were designed to prevent glare, according to a spokesperson for the city's Department of Transportation. But the current blue light allowance for the new street lights is higher than the new AMA recommendations call for.",
			"\"The problem is that if people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep,\" Maurice Ohayon, director of the Stanford Sleep Epidemiology Research Center, told The Huffington Post.",
			"Ohayon and his colleagues recently looked at the sleep habits and sleep quality of more than 15,800 people. They found that people who were exposed to more nighttime light were nearly twice as likely to be dissatisfied with their sleep as those living in areas with less light. Those exposed to more light at night also reported sleeping less at night and having more fatigue during the day.",
			"If people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep. Maurice Ohayon, Stanford University",
			"As that exposure to light happens over and over again, our circadian rhythms (the body’s internal clock) get disrupted. And beyond affecting sleep, disordered circadian rhythms are linked to higher rates of chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, depression and some cancers.",
			"In the same way that blue light from a smartphone or computer screen suppresses melatonin production in the brain (the body’s signal for sleep), it's the blue light in LEDs that causes trouble, Clete Kushida, a neurologist and sleep specialist at Stanford Sleep Medicine Center, explained in a KBCW video.",
			"Blame Light Color And Intensity",
			"There is actually no such thing as a \"white\" LED light, Stephen Quick, an architect and urban designer, told HuffPost.",
			"LED lights that appear white, like the ones used in streetlights are made up of a combination of amber, red, green and blue light, said Quick, an adjunct professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved in writing the AMA's recommendations.",
			"Quick and his colleagues took a deep dive into the research on cost-saving benefits and potential health, safety and aesthetic concerns of LED lights for a report for the city of Pittsburgh in 2011. The report was used to help Pittsburgh finalize its plan to replace its 40,000 streetlights.",
			"That research, like the new AMA recommendation, suggested that a neutral color light with about an even mix of blue and the other colors be used for streetlights, Quick said. \"Think incandescent light -- neither warm nor cool [in color]. It’s soft, but it doesn’t have the cool qualities that you’d see in a fluorescent light.\"",
			"Quick said that the Pittsburgh report's recommendations did allow for slightly more blue light than the AMA.",
			"Brighter But Not Safer",
			"The other potential problem with LED streetlights that are too bright, according to the AMA’s recommendation against them, is glare.",
			"\"A lot of people believe that the brighter the lights, the safer they are,\" Quick said.",
			"But LED light is directional -- meaning it gets emitted in a specific direction, unlike conventional lightbulbs, which put out light and heat in all directions.",
			"When the lights are lower consistently, we don’t have the glare problem we do when they’re really bright. Stephen Quick, Carnegie Mellon University",
			"Because the light is not diffused, LEDs create a \"glare zone\" for drivers at certain angles that can be worse than conventional streetlights, Quick said.",
			"The new AMA recommendations encourage \"proper design, shielding and installation\" to help mitigate glare.",
			"Quick also said that dimming the lights would help reduce glare. \"The higher the intensity, the more glare from the bounced light or the direct light,\" he said. \"And when the lights are lower consistently, we don’t have the glare problem we do when they’re really bright.\"",
			"The Cost Of Evolving Standards",
			"The AMA's new recommendations may call for some rethinking of current green building standards and projects.",
			"The U.S. Green Building Council -- the group that runs LEED, the most widely used green building certification program in the world -- does not support one specific type of streetlight over another, Theresa Backhaus, a site technical specialist for LEED, told HuffPost via email.",
			"\"We encourage lighting design to take all considerations into account for the health, safety and welfare of people and the environment,\" she said.",
			"USGBC's Light Pollution Reduction Credit was created precisely to reduce the harmful effects of light pollution, she said. The credit is one that buildings and development projects can meet to earn one of LEED's four rating levels.",
			"That credit requires projects to use lower lighting levels for \"sensitive areas,\" such as residential zones and nature preserves, but does not specify a limit on the amount of blue light that can be used.",
			"The good news is that most LEDs, especially newer ones, are made with dimming controls, Quick said -- so the intensity of the light can be adjusted fairly easily.",
			"Changing the color balance of the lights can be a lot more difficult.",
			"Sometimes it's possible to replace just the LED themselves, Quick said, but sometimes the whole fixture needs to be replaced. \"And that gets costly.\"",
			"The takeaway is that there’s nothing inherently bad about the LED lights themselves. \"We save a tremendous amount of energy by using them. We also save a lot of money in maintenance costs,\" Quick said.",
			"But getting the color and intensity right is important. \"The best procedure right now is for cities to be cautious and know what they’re buying,\" he added."

			"10 bizarre claims people make to avoid paying taxes"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Resistance to taxes is baked into Americans' DNA. After all, it was cries of \"taxation without representation\" that spurred the American Revolution. Tax protests have continued on and off ever since, from the Whiskey Rebellion to Vietnam War-era tax resisters to the \"sovereign citizen\" movement.",
			"People object to paying taxes for all kinds of reasons, from opposition to certain policies to not recognizing the government's authority to collect taxes in the first place, but the IRS isn't having it. No matter what you read on the internet or your weird Uncle Bob says, you can't get out of paying taxes without suffering consequences.",
			"\"The IRS and the courts hear many outlandish arguments from people trying to avoid their legal filing and tax obligations,\" IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a statement. \"Taxpayers should avoid unscrupulous promoters of false tax-avoidance arguments because taxpayers end up paying what they owe plus potential penalties and interest mandated by law.\"",
			"Now, that doesn't mean there aren't things you can do to legally avoid taxes. Taking all your deductions or moving money into tax-sheltered accounts like a 401K are perfectly acceptable ways to lower your tax bill. It's when you get into weirder tax avoidance strategies that you run into problems. (Note: Not paying your taxes can have serious implications for your credit. Check out our quick guide for keeping your taxes from messing with your credit. While you're at it, you can also get your two free credit scores, updated every 14 days.)",
			"Trying to claim that filing a tax return is optional, that you aren't really a citizen of the U.S., or that only certain types of income are taxable will backfire. When you submit a frivolous return or slam the IRS with other off-the-wall requests the result may be a fine of $5,000 to $25,000. Plus, you could also be prosecuted for tax evasion, a felony punishable by prison time and penalties of up to $250,000.",
			"The IRS spends a lot of time and energy debunking various convoluted anti-tax arguments, and it's collected dozens of them in a document titled \"The Truth About Frivolous Tax Arguments.\"",
			"Below, we've highlighted 10 of the more bizarre reasons why people say they shouldn't have to pay taxes.",
			"1. Filing a Return & Paying Taxes Is Voluntary",
			"The first and perhaps most direct argument against the U.S. tax system is the idea that filing a return and paying taxes is voluntary. Primary points include court cases like Flora v. United States, in which the term \"voluntary\" is used to describe how the tax system is based on \"voluntary assessment and payment, not upon distraint.\"",
			"But when the IRS says filing a return or paying taxes is \"voluntary\" what it really means is that a taxpayer has the right to determine his or her tax liability by completing the appropriate forms, as opposed to having the government complete the forms and determine the bill. It doesn't mean you have the option to opt out of the system entirely.",
			"2. The Money They Earned Isn't Really Income",
			"According to this anti-tax argument, the money you receive for working isn't technically income. Rather, you're engaged in an equal exchange of your labor for fair market wages, and thus there's no \"gain\" to be taxed. In this view, the government only has the right to tax gains or profit, not wages.",
			"In reality, the IRS is allowed to tax virtually all your income, whether it's dividend income from stocks or wages you receive from your employer. Exceptions include gifts and inheritances (though large estates may have to pay an estate tax), child support, life insurance benefits, and welfare payments.",
			"3. Taxes Are Against Their Religion",
			"You may not believe in paying taxes, but the IRS isn't buying it. Though churches and other religious institutions are exempt from taxes, the same does not apply to individual taxpayers.",
			"Allowing people to opt out of taxes on religious grounds would cripple the tax system. In the United States v. Lee, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \"[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.\"",
			"4. Paying Taxes Violates the Fifth Amendment",
			"Some argue that including financial information on a return may bring unlawful or illegal activity to light, thereby forcing a taxpayer to forego their Fifth Amendment protections.",
			"The IRS calls this a \"blanket assertion\" of constitutional privilege. The agency asserts that there are no constitutional grounds for the refusal to file a tax return based on the Fifth Amendment. In cases like the United States v. Sullivan and the United States v. Neff, the courts back the IRS's position.",
			"5. Paying Taxes Is a Form of Slavery",
			"The U.S. has prohibited involuntary servitude (except as punishment for a crime) since 1865, when the 13th Amendment was ratified. Since then, some anti-tax protestors have tried to equate paying taxes to slavery, arguing that having to send some of their money to the IRS is a constitutional violation. Even prominent politicians have evoked this absurd anti-tax argument. \"If we tax you at 50% you are half slave, half free,\" Rand Paul said in 2015. But the IRS and the courts have declared the \"taxes equals slavery\" claim bogus.",
			"On the flip side, arguments that African-Americans and Native Americans can claim a tax credit as reparations for slavery and other forms of oppression are invalid. While there have been serious arguments that the U.S. should pay reparations to the descendants of former slaves, the government has not taken any such action.",
			"6. The 16th Amendment Doesn't Count",
			"The 16th Amendment to the Constitution is short and to the point: \"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\"",
			"Yet some tax protestors argue the 16th Amendment is invalid because it was not properly ratified or that Ohio was not properly a state at the time it voted for the amendment. (Ohio has been a state since 1803; the amendment was ratified in 1913.) \"Proponents mistakenly believe that courts have refused to address this issue,\" the IRS noted. \"There were enough states ratifying the Sixteenth Amendment even without Ohio to complete the number needed for ratification. Furthermore, after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the income tax laws.\"",
			"7. Their State Isn't Part of the United States",
			"Among the goofier anti-tax arguments is the assertion that only people who live in the District of Columbia, in federal territories, or on Indian reservations or military bases have to pay federal income tax. Everyone else is supposedly a citizen of a \"sovereign\" state, not the U.S., which means they're exempt from federal income tax. Not so, says the IRS.",
			"\"The Internal Revenue Code imposes a federal income tax upon all United States citizens and residents, not just those who reside in the District of Columbia, federal territories, and federal enclaves,\" the IRS explained.",
			"8. The IRS Is Secretly a Private Corporation",
			"Some conspiracy theorists are convinced the IRS isn't actually part of the federal government at all. Supposedly, it's a private corporation masquerading as a government agency, and it actually has no authority to enforce the tax code. In the 2002 case Edwards v. Commissioner, the court dismissed the claim as \"tax protestor gibberish.\"",
			"9. They've Rejected Their Citizenship",
			"You can't reject your U.S. citizenship or claim to be a \"free born citizen\" of a particular state in order to get out of paying taxes. \"Claims that individuals are not citizens of the United States but are solely citizens of a sovereign state and not subject to federal taxation have been uniformly rejected by the courts,\" according to the IRS.",
			"Even if you were to formally renounce your U.S. citizenship (which involves appearing in person at a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country), you still may not be able to escape your tax bill. \"Persons who wish to renounce U.S. citizenship should be aware of the fact that renunciation of U.S. citizenship may have no effect on their U.S. tax or military service obligations,\" the State Department explained.",
			"10. They Aren't Technically a Person",
			"In various court cases, this argument has been declared \"meritless\" and \"frivolous and requir[ing] no discussion.\" Here's a tip: If the government is willing to consider a corporation a person, they're definitely going to consider a person a person."

			"When you think of contraception, it’s likely that condoms and the birth control pill first come to mind. Those are, after all, the most common methods, right? They are what get high-profile When you think of contraception, it’s likely that condoms and the birth control pill first come to mind. Those are, after all, the most common methods, right? They are what get high-profile television advertisements and spark contentious public debate here in the United States. But it turns out they are among the least common methods used around the world. In fact, they rank only slightly more common than the rhythm method or withdrawal.",
			"In honor of World Contraception Day, which falls on September 26, we took a look at data around birth control-use worldwide — and some of the most common birth control is pretty surprising. Perhaps most of all that the leading method of contraception is female sterilization, a surgery where a woman is permanently rendered infertile.",
			"Last year, 19 percent of women around the globe who were married or in a relationship relied on sterilization, according to a Last year, 19 percent of women around the globe who were married or in a relationship relied on sterilization, according to a report by the United Nations . Next most common was the IUD, a little pregnancy-preventing device that’s inserted into the uterus, which was used by 14 percent of partnered women around the world. Much less common were short-term methods, including the birth control pill (9 percent), the male condom (8 percent), and injectibles like Depo-Provera (5 percent). Compare those numbers to the 6 percent of women who used the rhythm method or withdrawal.",
			"More The Future Of Birth Control Might Be On Your Phone",
			"Surprising as it may be, there’s every reason to celebrate this as good news — long-acting methods like the IUD tend to be more effective because they leave little room for inconsistent use (i.e. missed pills or running out of condoms).",
			"There’s also this positive finding: The overall prevalence of contraception has nearly doubled since 1970, from 36 percent to 64 percent in 2015. That is to say: The majority of partnered women around the world now use some form of contraceptive. These numbers are much less encouraging among the least developed countries, where that number drops to just 40 percent. In Africa, it is just 33 percent. At the opposite end of the spectrum is China, which only this year ended its infamous one-child policy, with 84 percent of women using contraception. Close behind is Northern Europe, with 77 percent, and North and South America, with 75 percent each.",
			"In the coming decades, those numbers are expected to shoot up. By 2030, the UN predicts that the number of partnered women using contraception will rise by 20 million to nearly 800 million. But, it’s World Contraceptive Day, which has In the coming decades, those numbers are expected to shoot up. By 2030, the UN predicts that the number of partnered women using contraception will rise by 20 million to nearly 800 million. But, it’s World Contraceptive Day, which has the stated aim of a world \"where every pregnancy is wanted,\" so we’d be remiss to end on that sunny note. While the situation has certainly dramatically improved, the number of women worldwide who want contraception but don’t have access is actually expected to change relatively very little: from 142 million to 143 million by 2030. That’s thanks to growing contraceptive demand and rising numbers of reproductive-age women in sub-Saharan Africa.",
			"So, unfortunately, it looks like the need for World Contraceptive Day isn’t going away any time soon."

			"Every year, about 42.5 million American adults (or 18.2 percent of the total adult population in the United States) suffers from some mental illness, enduring conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, statistics released Friday reveal.",
			"The data, compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), also indicate that approximately 9.3 million adults, or about 4 percent of those Americans ages 18 and up, experience \"serious mental illness\" – that is, their condition impedes day-to-day activities, such as going to work.",
			"This data does not diverge greatly from the last SAMHSA report, released in 2012, which found that 45.9 million American adults, 20 percent of this demographic, experienced mental illness at least once annually. (Though there is a 1.8 percent difference, the statistics do have margins of error, and methods of compiling them are often revised, so this dip does not necessarily mean there has been a long-term decline in mental illness.)",
			"The SAMHSA paper comes amid increasing scrutiny of the ability of America’s health care system to handle issues of mental illness. For example, the American Mental Health Counselors Association released a study earlier this week claiming that adults with mental illness who live in those states electing against expanding Medicaid under Obamacare will be denied insurance. According to the study, care could be denied to up to 4 million patients.",
			"The SAMHSA study breaks down mental illness rates by state. Perhaps surprisingly, New Jersey had the lowest national rates of overall and severe mental illness – 14.7 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.",
			"The states with the most mental illness?",
			"In Utah, 22.3 percent of the adult population experienced mental illness, and in West Virginia had the most cases of severe mental illness among adults, at 5.5 percent.",
			"It may be tempting to look at the map that accompanies the study and try to make guesses at why, say, the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest seem to suffer more from mental illness than other regions. However, because there is so much mental health illness in all the states – and lots of uncontrolled variables – it would be hard to draw any real conclusions. According to the study, \"factors that potentially contribute to the variation are not well understood and need further study.\"",
			"Not all psychiatric statisticians are satisfied with SAMHSA’s findings, with some alleging that the agency grossly understates the prevalence of mental illness.",
			"Ronald Kessler, McNeil Family Professor of Health Care at Harvard and expert in large scale mental illness surveys, tells Newsweek that SAMHSA’s assessment of serious mental illness is \"pretty good\" but that he believes that the \"prevalence for any mental illness is too low.\"",
			"Kessler, who is familiar with SAMHSA’s computational methods, said that the agency did not measure all of the ailments in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -- including some major ones like attention deficit disorder.",
			"\"I find it objectionable that they use this term ‘any mental illness,’\" he says. \"What they really mean is any mental illness that they decided to measure. What they ask about is anxiety and depression and drinking and drugs, but there are many things beside that they totally ignored.\"’",
			"Kessler estimates that the prevalence of mental illness might range from 25 to 30 percent of American adults. A 2011 report published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pegs the number at 25 percent.",
			"SAMHSA’s statistics division disagrees with Kessler’s assessment.",
			"\"This captures the majority of people suffering from mental illness in the country,\" Dr. Kevin Hennessy, deputy director of the Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, tells Newsweek. According to the report, the state-level estimates are based on data collected from 92,400 adults 18 and over from the 2011 and 2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. The survey itself was built around the DSM, but also includes an \"improved prediction model\" developed based on previous survey attempts.",
			"Ultimately, the experts might be splitting hairs; even the state with the lowest rate of mental illness still nears 15 percent. Perhaps more importantly, only 62.9 percent of adults nationwide with serious mental illness received mental health treatment in the year they reported this illness.",
			"Dr. Peter Delany – director of the \"the government’s lead agency for behavioral health statistics,\" the Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, according to SAMHSA’s website – tells Newsweek that the information shows policymakers, in black and white terms, that mental illness impacts a large portion of the population, regardless of statistical caveats.",
			"\"These are real people that have very serious problems,\" he says. \"The data should be helping us think through how we want to approach helping them get services that they need.\""

			"According to The Associated Press, Tyler Comstock, 19, of Boone, was fatally shot the morning of Nov. 4 after a car chase with police ended on Iowa State University's central campus in Ames.",
			"Explaining how the teen found himself in a face-off with police, Comstock's family says that the events of that fateful morning had been triggered by an argument between the young man and his father.",
			"\"He just wanted a pack of cigarettes, and his dad wouldn’t buy him a pack of cigarettes and he freaked out,\" the teen's mother, Shari Comstock, told the Iowa State Daily.",
			"After the feud, Comstock reportedly got into his father's car and took off.",
			"That's when his dad, James Comstock, decided to call the police to report his vehicle stolen.",
			"\"He took off with my truck. I call the police, and they kill him,\" James Comstock told the Des Moines Register. It is believed that the truck belonged to the lawn care company for which the father and son both worked.",
			"After James Comstock's call, police were soon on the teenager's tail. Comstock, however, reportedly refused to stop his vehicle and rammed into an officer's car. Police then pursued him to Iowa State University's campus in Ames.",
			"Eventually surrounded by cops, Comstock finally came to a stop on the school's Central Campus, but the young man reportedly ignored orders to turn his engine off.",
			"It was then that a police officer named Adam McPherson is said to have fired six shots into the truck. The teen, believed to have been unarmed, died from two gunshot wounds, per the AP.",
			"Comstock's family is flabbergasted as to how a minor family dispute turned into an unspeakable tragedy.",
			"\"So he didn’t shut the damn truck off, so let’s fire six rounds at him? We’re confused, and we don’t understand,\" Comstock’s step-grandfather, Gary Shepley, told the Register.",
			"According to dispatch audio obtained by the news outlet, an unidentified police staffer suggested on two different occasions during the chase that officers back off their pursuit of Comstock. (Listen to the dispatch at the Des Moines Register.)",
			"\"I don’t understand [why this happened] when I blatantly heard them say, ‘Hey, we know who this is. It’s a kid, back off.’ I don’t get it,\" Comstock's mom told the Iowa State Daily after listening to the audio tape of the dispatch.",
			"Police say Comstock may have put lives in danger when he drove through the university and that student pedestrians had to dodge his truck \"to avoid being run over,\" per the AP.",
			"However, his mother questioned the officers' actions and how they may have affected the situation.",
			"\"Why the hell would they chase him into campus with all the people?\" she told the State Daily. \"Tyler would never hurt anybody, ever. He was just a scared child. He’s pretty rational when he calms down.\""

			"USA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn’t pay his bills",
			"\"During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza.",
			"\"The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder. \"Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. \"That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company... which has been around since my grandfather,\" he said.",
			"\"Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your job.\" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades – and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.",
			"\"At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.",
			"\"Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.",
			"\"In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens – filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work – since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.",
			"\"The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.\""

			"How Farmers Markets Can Help Fight Hunger"
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Although today’s farmers markets seem more concerned with the authenticity of the heirloom pedigrees of their produce than with feeding the hungry, it wasn’t always that way. The public markets that date back to the early days of the colonies were important both for trade and keeping people fed. More recently, in the birth of the modern farmers market movement more than 40 years ago, antihunger groups played a key role. In the early 1970s, the direct retail sale of fruits and vegetables by farmers was illegal in California, and the first modern farmers markets in the state opened in 1979, after the then-and-again governor, Jerry Brown, signed the Direct Marketing Act, allowing growers to sell directly to consumers. The first market in Southern California opened in the parking lot of a church in Gardena, a diverse city in the South Bay of Los Angeles County. The market was sponsored by the Interfaith Hunger Coalition, part of the Southern California Ecumenical Council, and was intended to bring the blue-collar city fresh, healthy fruits and vegetables at affordable prices. The coalition expanded into four other communities the following year.",
			"Spreading widely and wildly throughout California and across the country over the succeeding decades, farmers markets have drifted somewhat from their antihunger roots. As humorist Clare Doody wrote for The Washington Post last year, everyone who shops at the farmers market has \"already done yoga that morning. Yet somehow they didn’t sweat; their topknot still looks good and they’ve got on a great scarf. And don’t get me started on the women.\" Every paragraph of her piece begins \"I don’t like farmers markets because...\" It’s satire, sure, but it hits close to the experience of shopping the Wednesday-morning market in downtown Santa Monica—where no one appears to have a day job, everyone is an actor/model/DJ, and, yes, they just came from yoga.",
			"Last week, however, the Los Angeles City Council passed a measure that will reconnect the city’s 57 markets with their antihunger roots—and further advance a national movement to leverage farmers markets to help increase food access for poor Americans. The measure, which received unanimous support, will require that every farmers market in the city accept Electronic Benefits Transfer cards, which are used to redeem food stamp benefits. Last summer, the Los Angeles Food Policy Council, which lobbied for the measure, found that half the city’s markets either didn’t accept EBT or couldn’t be confirmed as accepting it.",
			"Vance Corum, who helped open that first market in Gardena, said, \"The decision by the council to require all markets to accept EBT is the most positive thing the city can do\" to provide equal access to farmers markets.",
			"\"We lost a lot of poor people who were coming to farmers markets,\" continued Corum, who runs the Washington state–based nonprofit Farmers’ Markets America. \"Now we’ve built them back to some extent, and we’ll continue to see some bright light at the end of the tunnel, where people of all ethnicities, all income levels, will have some form of access.\"",
			"The largely white and middle-class local food movement, which spurred the popularity of farmers markets, is not to blame for that loss. Rather, changes to how federal benefits were distributed cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients off from the resource. Between 1994 and 2013, the number of farmers markets nationwide has increased from fewer than 2,000 to 8,144, \"thereby potentially increasing access to farm products for nutrition assistance program participants,\" according to a USDA report. In 1994, just over a quarter of markets accepted food stamps, which were then redeemed with paper vouchers. As the nutrition assistance program switched over to EBT cards in the early 2000s, the ability for cash-based farmers markets to accept food stamps declined sharply, hitting just 8 percent of all markets in 2004. But managers of farmers markets and their vendors have been catching up. As of 2011, more than a third of markets accepted benefits, and the share has continued to increase.",
			"The Los Angeles ordinance will further increase that figure. To prevent vendors from spending so they can accept plastic, managers at each market will be required to have an EBT point-of-sale machine (provided for free by the state) that will allow SNAP recipients to debit their cards and receive scrips or tokens representing the equivalent amount of cash. Customers can then spend the scrips with vendors, who can redeem them for cash or another form of payment from the market operators at the end of the day.",
			"The scrip can go a lot further at the farmers market than you might imagine. A number of regional price-comparison studies of farmers markets and grocery stores have found that buying direct costs roughly the same, and sometimes even less, than shopping at a supermarket. One study conducted in Vermont found that buying organic items from the farmers market was less expensive in every instance than buying from the store. That’s not to say that some farmers market items aren’t exorbitantly expensive. As Michel Nischan of Wholesome Wave said, \"People will fixate on the $5-a-pound heirloom tomato, but they will not fixate on the 80-cents-a-pound kohlrabi.\" That same tomato might cost a dollar or two a pound when it’s a little past its prime and perfect for making sauce.",
			"Nischan’s work at Wholesome Wave is dedicated to making SNAP scrips go twice as far by expanding market-match programs, which incentivize food stamp recipients to shop at farmers markets by matching the amount they spend with an EBT card. Local programs around the country provide such matching funds, and Nischan’s organization was able to get federal funds supporting market-match programs included in the 2014 farm bill. Last year, California received a $3.7 million grant to expand market match in the state. While having an EBT machine at a farmers market can help bring in new customers, those with market-match programs see even larger increases in business. According to Nischan, markets that add a doubling program can see a 38 percent jump in overall sales compared with when they accepted EBT.",
			"\"What we’ve seen is that little bit of incentive—it can just be a $5 doubling or a $10 doubling—it changes the way these SNAP consumers spend the rest of their SNAP dollars,\" Nischan said. \"You give these families an extra $10 a week, and they move mountains with it.\"",
			"Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O’Farrell mentioned the possibility of expanding market-match programs in Los Angeles as a potential step beyond the EBT ordinance. But according to a study released Tuesday on farmers markets in South Los Angeles, the market-match programs available aren’t connecting with residents in parts of the city where food access is the poorest and rates of diet-related disease are the highest. According to a Community Health Councils report, more than 80 percent of nearly 500 consumers surveyed were not aware of market match. Furthermore, there simply are not enough markets serving communities in South Los Angeles, according to Gwendolyn Flynn, CHC’s policy director of nutrition resources development—and the perception remains that not all residents are welcome at those markets that do exist in poor, diverse communities.",
			"\"The support of the city council, with their vote, was tremendous in helping to dispel this notion that this was for a few people—no, it’s for everybody,\" she said. Low-income shoppers have felt that \"farmers markets were kind of elitist—and that’s not the case.\"",
			"Some organizers see farmers markets as an alternative to the long-flagging efforts to bring grocery stores and other food retailers into neighborhoods that have historically lacked access. But Flynn is hoping for more dynamic, more diverse solutions—not only to the diet-related problems that neighborhoods are facing but to the lack of jobs and economic opportunity as well.",
			"\"Having farmers markets shouldn’t preclude us from having supermarkets and grocery stores and community gardens and other forms of urban agriculture,\" she said.",
			"But, as Nischan said, \"frankly, from an economic perspective, when you talk about making food access a quick reality, it’s a lot cheaper to open a four-, five-, or six-vendor market\" than to open a grocery store. \"If I were a grocery store owner, I wouldn’t do it either,\" he said, referring to opening a location in a low-income neighborhood.",
			"Flynn contends that bringing more food access across the board, from grocery stores that hire hundreds of workers to community gardens that reduce blight and provide opportunities for civic engagement, \"would help to reinvigorate and stimulate these local economies and in the long run would contribute to the health outcomes in communities like South Los Angeles.\"",
			"That kind of broad-based neighborhood change, in part driven by farmers markets, has happened before—to a degree. For example, in the early days of the Hollywood Farmers Market, \"Hollywood was a little bit of a rough neighborhood, so we were looking for a social impact related to many things,\" said James Haydu, the executive director of SEE-LA, which operates markets across Los Angeles. Not only did the market sell food to residents and area restaurants, but it used public space, got people out into the street interacting with one another, and helped to support California farmers.",
			"Santa Monica was also a far different place in the early 1980s, when its famed downtown market made its debut, from what it is today, with its many post-yoga-class actors."

		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Every summer, we are constantly on the look out for new destinations to explore. Besides, of all the 7,641 Philippine Islands, only a handfull are generally considered as established tourist destinations. This includes the island province of Palawan. After earning the most coveted spot as the \"World Best Island\" for 2 consecutive years, truck loads of tourists have made this their destination of choice, leading to the overnight fame of 3 of its major attractions: Puerto Princesa, El Nido and Coron. However, as how the saying goes \"save the best for last,\" Palawan’s finest set of islands is hidden far away from the bustling crowd of Central and Northern Palawan and is found at the southern tip of this elongated landmass. The Balabac Archipelago is a group of 31 islands found at the very tip of the Palawan Province. It’s a collection of islets, atolls and sand bars, of which Onuk Island is said to be the best, most beautiful, most coveted and yet the most elusive island.",
			"To get here, one needs to travel to Rio Tuba town from Puerto Princesa, a good 4-hour drive and another 4 hours by boat going to Balabac town from Rio Tuba. Balabac town is still in its purest and untouched form, therefore, accommodations are very basic. From basic to \"roughing it,\" lodging are available in Balabac town and Punta Sebaring Island.",
			"From Balabac town, iHAPer must take another 2.5 hour scenic boat ride before reaching the paradise called Onuk island. The boat ride can be very calm to rough depending on the time of the day and weather, however, one can witness an otherworldly change of water color from dark blue, light blue to crystal clear white as the island gets closer.",
			"Once the island is reached a blinding white sandy shore welcomes travellers, while a rustic-looking wharf and cottages on stilts is easily noticeable from the approaching boat.",
			"The island of Onuk is blessed with immense beauty. Here, one will find probably the whitest and finest sand, comparable to that of talcum powder; a patch of lush vegetation at the center of the island; nesting sea turtles that come back to the island to lay their eggs; and the healthiest corals, where giant Taclobo clams, Nemo, Dory and other types of fish swim in abundance. To top it all, a view of the mountain range of Sabah, Malaysia is surprisingly visible on the southern horizon of the island.",
			"Travel Pointers",
			"Accessing the Island is quite tricky, not because of it’s location but because of the permit that any potential visitor has to request for to visit the island. The Island of Onuk is owned by the Mayor of Balabac, Palawan and any request to visit the island must be coordinated with the LGU of Balabac. Based on the experience of the group of travel blogger Chyng Reyes, permits are only issued, a day before the visit, so an alternate plan to visit other islands of Balabac must be in place as a back up.",
			"It is also highly suggested to have a reliable boatman since the town is fairly new in catering to incoming visitors. One highly recommended boatman is Kuya Fidel. His rental rate is P3000 per day, good for 6 people."

		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Teachers aren’t uniquely sensitive creatures; they are experts in their field and, by voting with their feet and leaving their vocation, they are sending a warning to the Government that something is seriously wrong",
			"Schools are reaching a crisis point. By 2025 there will be 3 million pupils of secondary school age, but not enough young people are choosing to become teachers themselves. Teacher training places are going unfilled. Early last September, half of places on some such courses were sitting empty with just days to go before classes began.",
			"Government recruitment targets have been missed in the majority of subjects, including physics (by 19 per cent) and mathematics (by 16 per cent). Design and Technology only reached 41 per cent of its recruitment target this year.",
			"Meanwhile we’re shedding existing teachers from our schools at record rates: 10,000 departed the profession between 2010 and 2015, and the pace of that loss is speeding up as disillusionment grows. Another £3bn cut to budgets is anticipated in the coming years – likely to be confirmed in Philip Hammond’s Budget next month – meaning that spending will reduce by 8 per cent per secondary pupil within the next three years.",
			"In short, there simply aren’t enough teachers to educate our young people and it’s a crisis that is entirely politically manufactured.",
			"Three years ago, half of teachers said they were considering leaving the profession. At that point, as well as dealing with a spiralling workload, they were also being insulted each morning on the radio, in the press or in parliament by the then Education Secretary Michael Gove. The very man who should have been fighting their corner in an age of cutbacks instead spent his days inventing some very creative names for teachers: \"the blob\", the \"enemies of promise\", \"soft bigots\" with \"low expectations\".",
			"Gove was later replaced by Nicky Morgan, who, instead of repairing fractured relations, sought to rub salt into the glistening wounds. She accused teachers of \"doing battle\" unnecessarily with the Government and \"doing down the profession they represent in the process\". And, when similar research was carried out last year, nothing had improved.",
			"MPs picked apart the result of all this mud-slinging this week: \"As the population grows, efforts to recruit and retain good quality teachers become even more critical,\" they warned. \"While recruiting sufficient new teachers is, of course, necessary, the Government should place greater emphasis on improving teacher retention ... Not only is this a more cost-effective way to tackle some of the issues, but more teachers staying in the profession for longer would strengthen the pool of leadership positions.\"",
			"But why would anyone want to put in the hours (60+ per week, of which less than half is actually spent in the classroom teaching children) to build their career to leadership level when the Government pig-headedly refuses to do the one thing that would actually help solve this problem: listen to teachers, and acknowledge what they are saying?",
			"Teachers aren’t uniquely sensitive creatures; they are experts in their field and, by voting with their feet and leaving their vocation, they are sending a warning to the Government that something is seriously wrong. And it’s easy to discover what, because they have been talking about it openly for years.",
			"First, there’s the unreasonable workload. That, as teachers themselves have pointed out, is not exclusive to their profession. However, in teaching, the weight of the workload is compounded by data-gathering, form-filling, or any of the other myriad examples of endless bureaucracy that the Government requires in their futile efforts to continuously compare one school with another.",
			"Then there’s the apparent ignorance from the Government of what teachers are actually trying to achieve. As one former teacher, Zoe Brown, who quit last year, told The Independent: \"In some ways I don’t feel like a teacher at all anymore. I prepare children for tests and, if I’m honest, I do it quite well. It’s not something I’m particularly proud of, as it’s not as if I have provided my class with any transferable, real-life skills during the process. They’ve not enjoyed it, I’ve not enjoyed it, but we’ve done it: one thing my children know how to do is answer test questions.\"",
			"On top of that, there are ideological concerns for some about the forced academisation programme, which gives businesses influence over young people; the truly chilling effect of year-on-year pay freezes (the clue’s in the name); and an enforced increase in employee contributions to pension plans which make even experienced teachers worse off year-by-year. Little wonder they are looking for alternatives in the jobs market.",
			"Of course, not all teachers who are considering leaving within the next five years will go through with that threat. \"Considering leaving\" teaching may also mean weighing up the remaining benefits against the drawbacks of starting over in another line of work.",
			"The pay in teaching may not seem competitive when compared to other graduate roles, but the 12 weeks’ paid holiday a year is some recompense; it may sound like a virtual nirvana for others trapped in an unfulfilling role with just quarter of that annual allowance of time to oneself.",
			"Yet the MPs are right to set off a flare: with Brexit fast approaching, immigration can no longer be relied upon to fill teaching gaps. Important subjects such as technology and the sciences are being neglected in our schools as specialist teaching posts sit vacant – many in the very disciplines that will create the jobs of the future, in a high-tech economy.",
			"Ministers play fast and loose with the carrots – attractive bursaries to train, higher pay and debt write-offs for new teachers entering in-demand subjects – while appearing oblivious to all the sticks they are throwing at the same time. Teaching must be made more attractive.",
			"MPs have some interesting ideas on how to achieve this, such as capping the number of hours outside the classroom that teachers are expected to work, but there’s no need for complicated brainstorming sessions. The simplest thing that the Government could do to make education a more enticing career is to simply open their ears."

However, some of the players think that rooting the phone is no crime as many people roots their Android devices to make them more customizable. On the other hand, there are also people who buy unlocked phone to avoid some extra charges.",

			"Pokemon Go is back on track with the release of the Buddy update, after the drastic downfall it had seen over the course of the last month. However, players facing this type of issues can hamper the game once again. It’ll be better for Niantic if they sort out something soon in this matter."

			"The pharmaceutical industry has become a major health hazard to the American people.",
			"Our nation pays - by far - the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. As a result of these outrageous prices, nearly one in five Americans cannot afford to fill their prescriptions. Meanwhile, the five largest prescription drug companies made a combined $50 billion in profits last year. That is unacceptable. A lifesaving product does no one any good if a patient cannot buy the medicine they need, and that is now happening far too often in the richest nation in the world.",
			"A new report out today from Americans for Tax Fairness explains how a pharmaceutical company, Gilead Sciences, games the system to charge high prices, shift profits offshore and avoid billions in U.S. taxes.",
			"Gilead sells a drug called Sovaldi, which is used to treat the hepatitis C virus. The drug was developed with taxpayer funds by a researcher who worked at the Department of Veterans Affairs and founded a small drug company. Gilead bought the company for $11 billion, acquired the government-provided monopoly rights and set the price at $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 per treatment in 2013.",
			"U.S. public and private insurers, taxpayers and patients spent more money on Sovaldi in 2014 than on any other prescription drug. Gilead made its investment back in less than a year.",
			"If gone untreated, hepatitis C can end in what one nurse-practitioner called \"some of the worst deaths I've ever seen.\" She said, \"At the end, you die not knowing who you are, your belly looks 12 months pregnant, you're malnourished, and you're bleeding to death.\"",
			"Patients with hepatitis C are often low-income and a disproportionate number of them are veterans. Yet many Medicaid programs have had to limit access to the drug, and despite spending literally billions of dollars on the new hepatitis C drugs, the Department of Veterans Affairs initially struggled to provide the medication to every veteran who needed it.",
			"Meanwhile, Gilead's profits have quintupled since it started selling the drug, from $4 billion in 2013 to $22 billion in 2015.",
			"It gets worse. The Americans for Tax Fairness report finds that Gilead has dodged nearly $10 billion in U.S. taxes.",
			"How is that possible?",
			"Gilead claimed that despite making \"two-thirds of its revenues here and charging higher drug prices than anywhere else in the world, it made only about one-third of its profits in the United States,\" according to the report. The company pays an effective tax rate of just 1 percent in the foreign countries where it claims to do business. And in 2013, Gilead's chief financial officer said the formula for Sovaldi was being transferred to Ireland in order to lower the company's effective tax rate.",
			"The strategy worked: Gilead's worldwide effective tax rate dropped from 27 percent in 2013 to 16 percent in 2015.",
			"Many American corporations use this practice to avoid paying U.S. taxes, but Gilead's greed is particularly reprehensible because the American public paid for these drugs twice: first taxpayers bankrolled the research behind the hepatitis C drugs and then they paid a second time when Gilead decided to charge Americans the highest price in the world for the treatment.",
			"And now Americans are getting cheated a third time as Gilead stashes its profits abroad to avoid taxes.",
			"But Gilead is not the only company taking advantage of our public research funding and tax loopholes. Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Meyers Squibb and many others engage in similar offshore tax dodging to avoid billions in U.S. taxes each year.",
			"At what point do we say our tax system, our publicly funded research and our patent system are not serving the public interest? At what point do we realize that they have been distorted to serve the private interests of a few billionaires like John C. Martin, Gilead's CEO until this past March, whose compensation peaked at almost $200 million in 2014? At what point will Congress have the courage to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and say enough is enough?",
			"Last year I asked the Department of Veterans Affairs to use an existing law allowing the federal government to break patents in order to make hepatitis C drugs available to veterans. I also introduced a bill last year, the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act, which would tax all profits of American corporations the same way regardless of where they are earned. This would eliminate the incentive for companies to hide their profits overseas.",
			"I have also supported legislation that would lower costs for consumers by rewarding developers of medicines on the basis of a drug's benefit to consumers. Under such a system, Sovaldi would have been awarded a substantial monetary prize as it represented a major advancement for patients with hepatitis C, but under my proposal, the drug would immediately come on the market as a generic drug, saving consumers a decade or more of paying exorbitant prices for brand-name drugs. I also strongly support instructing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and reducing the barriers to the importation of prescription medication from Canada and other countries.",
			"Other countries strictly regulate what pharmaceutical companies can charge, but in the U.S. there is no limit to the egregious profiteering of corporate CEOs. Coupling outrageous prices on drugs with new and inventive ways to avoid paying taxes is truly shameless.",
			"That must change.",
			"Americans who suffer from hepatitis C today and from many other serious illnesses -- including veterans, retirees, and children -- need a government that works for them, not just the CEOs of large pharmaceutical companies and the billionaire class."

		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"An unmade bed, littered with empty bottles, cigarettes, condoms and panty hose, does not seem like the tableaux for a million-dollar masterpiece. Who wants to look at someone else's trash masquerading as art, critics undoubtedly decry, let alone purchase it for an amount of money usually reserved for large homes and boats?",
			"If your blood is boiling just thinking about the possibility of such a scenario, you might want to stop reading here. Because yes, such an artwork exists. And yes, it's set to fetch up to $2 million at auction.",
			"'My Bed' at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 2008. (Photo courtesy of Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images)",
			"The object in question is Young British Artists star Tracey Emin's \"My Bed,\" and, according to Art Daily, it's headed to the auction block as part of Christie's Post-war and Contemporary Art Sale in London on July 1, priced between £800,000 and £1.2m (approximately $1.35 million to $2 million). If you are versed in contemporary art history, you're probably well aware of Emin's infamous bed, which garnered the attention of Turner Prize judges back in 1999. She didn't win the prestigious prize (that year, \"12 Years a Slave\" director Steve McQueen nabbed the trophy), but plenty of people took notice of her objet d'mess thereafter.",
			"The work is meant to be confessional. \"Tracey shows us her own bed, in all its embarrassing glory,\" Saatchi Gallery explains online. \"Empty booze bottles, fag butts, stained sheets, worn panties: the bloody aftermath of a nervous breakdown. By presenting her bed as art, Tracey Emin shares her most personal space, revealing she's as insecure and imperfect as the rest of the world.\"",
			"The piece acts like a slice of life circa the late 1990s, that's specific to the person, woman and artist Emin was at the start of her career. Reflecting on her bed, Emin said to The New York Times last year: \"I was thinking, with the cigarettes, that’s so weird because I don’t smoke anymore. I haven’t had sex for years, and there’s this condom. God, there’s a tampon, and I haven’t had a period for years. There’s my ex-boyfriend’s marijuana, I would never be with anyone who smokes marijuana now; there’s a whiskey bottle, and I don’t drink spirits... I can actually smell the past.\"",
			"\"It’s a strange feeling, a good feeling,\" she added. \"This ghost of me was still there.\"",
			"British arts dealer/YBA proponent Charles Saatchi is the man behind the sale, and all proceeds will help fund his gallery's free entry policy and its free education program for schools in London."

			"The Real Costs of a \"Marvel body\": How the pressure to look like Thor and Captain America is hurting men"
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"\"Bigorexia\" is on the rise—male body standards have changed drastically since superheroes looked like George Reeves",
			"Do you want a body like a Marvel superhero? Be prepared to eat—a lot.",
			"In a recent interview with BuzzFeed, Chris Hemsworth’s stunt double, Bobby Holland Hanton, told the outlet that he has to eat 35 times a day to \"anywhere near [Hemsworth’s] size.\" Henton, who claims that he also worked out twice a day to stay in superhero shape, previously told Muscle and Fitness that his high protein diet (which consisted of turkey, chicken, nuts, eggs, and spinach) was a massive impediment to having a healthy social life: \"It made me kind of unsociable in a way because you can’t go out with friends or family because you’re picking what you can and can’t in the menu. ... It was a big challenge for me.\"",
			"Hanton’s interview illustrates the extreme pressures that men face to be as fit and as big as humanly possible. Following the success of \"The Avengers,\" and most recently \"Captain America: Civil War,\" a number of workout and diet regimens promise to help men look like Thor, Hawkeye, and the Captain (in as little as six weeks!). These routines have become so widespread that as Muscle and Fitness reports, they are arguably more popular than the actors who popularized them: \"The physique he built has made ‘Chris Hemsworth Workout’ the top search suggestion when you punch the actor’s name into Google.\"",
			"There are several different Marvel-themed programs that will help men seeking maximum muscularity achieve their fitness goals, many of which are prohibitively expensive. If the USDA estimated in 2016 that the average adult male aged 19-50 spends around $69.80 every week on food, that’s based on the expectation that these men eat around three meals a day—with perhaps a snack in between. Hanton eats 10 times that amount, meaning that a fitness enthusiast hoping to keep pace with his diet would spend $698 a week to do so. That comes out to $36,000 a year. (To clarify: That's a top-end estimate",
			"it's possible Hanton is not eating full meals every time he eats.) That’s not even adding in the costs of paid programs like CrossFit, which commonly set members back around $200 each month.",
			"In addition to the cost, there are a number of dangers to the Marvel plan. The first is overexertion: As Time reported in February of last year, working out too much can actually be just as harmful for one’s health as working out too little. Researchers in Denmark found that \"people who push their bodies too hard may essentially undo the benefit of exercise.\" In the case of Gerard Butler, the famously grueling workout he was subjected to for \"300\" stopped him from exercising at all after the movie wrapped",
			"he quit working out for a year. In a 2007 interview with Film Monthly, the Scottish actor claimed that he would never make the choice to put his body through that again.",
			"Extreme fitness programs can be dangerous in a variety of ways: They are bad for your body, decrease life expectancy, and are associated with a high rate of injury. As fitness instructor Erin Simmons argued in a 2014 article on CrossFit, crash exercising can be a gift to doctors because it \"means job security for medical professionals.\" Simmons spoke with a number of \"strength and conditioning coaches\" about the rise of regimes like CrossFit and \"not a single one of them\" would recommend it. She continues, \"These same athletic trainers warn every single athlete against CrossFit and tell them the health risks of being involved in it.\"",
			"With the extreme risks and financial burden associated with looking like Steve Rogers, it’s worth asking: Is this emphasis on getting big at all costs making us any happier? In 2015, a BBC report noted that \"bigorexia\" (more accurately known as \"muscle dysphoria\") is on the rise in young men. Rob Willson, who serves as the president of the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, told the BBC: \"We know about 10 percent of men in the gym may have muscle dysmorphia.\" Dr. Michele Kerulis of Adler School of Professional Psychology told The Daily Mail that rate may be even higher: She claimed as many as 45 percent of frequent male gym goers male suffer from disordered body image.",
			"That estimate seems very high, but it’s impossible to ignore the fact that male body standards have changed dramatically since Superman looked like George Reeves, rather than a human action figure. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to build muscle mass or be fit, but it’s worth remembering that there’s a reason Chris Hemsworth has the ability to look like a Norse God: He’s paid to. He has the luxury to spend absurdly long hours in the gym because it is his job. For the rest of us, attempting to live our lives by those same standards isn’t just impossible. It might be killing us."

			"Put 1 or 2 pairs of shoes in the shoe compartment, and socks, underwear or a light jacket in the upper compartment, and still have plenty of room for everything else.",
			"On the bottom of the bag we have included a shoe compartment where you can easily fit up to two pairs of shoes. (2 pairs of U.S. size 12 fit comfortably inside)",
			"On the top of the bag is a similar compartment to the shoe compartment where you can keep socks, underwear, or even a light jacket for easy access when you get cold while traveling. These compartments were designed to help you organize your packing rather than just stuffing everything into one big pocket like most duffel bags.",
			"At 21\" x 14\" x 9\" inches this bag meets domestic and international carry-on standards.",
			"Keep your phone, sunglasses, and other valuables protected in this soft fleece-lined pocket on the top side of the bag.",
			"With this combination of mesh, fleece-lined, and zipper pockets, you can keep your cords, power banks, laptop chargers and any other odds and ends right where you need them.",
			"The side pocket is sized to hold a BASICS Notebook or any other book of a similar size (roughly 5.5\" x 8.75\")",
			"When the bag is worn in backpack mode, this pocket is easily accessible, making it the perfect place for frequently needed travel documents. Also, because it is positioned with the zipper close to your back it makes it more difficult for pickpockets to access this zipper undetected.",
			"Carrying your luggage can become painful and heavy, so we added a very comfortable handle to make your interactions with the bag as enjoyable as possible.",
			"Last but not least we have added a sternum strap for added comfort and support.",
			"The following three accessories are designed to fit perfectly inside the bag and to match the design of the bag to create the perfect travel kit. However, in order to simplify the ordering process on Kickstarter these products will not be available for order until after our Kickstarter campaign ends, but they will ship with the travel bag.",
			"Toiletries bag",
			"Made from the same Tarpaulin material as the Travel Bag, this toiletries bag will last forever and will keep liquid spill inside the toiletries bag and away from your clothes.",
			"Waist Strap",
			"To give you better support when carrying the bag, you can clip on these waist straps to distribute the weight more comfortably. Also each strap has a pocket big enough to hold your passport for even more functionality.",
			"Shoe bag",
			"In case you want to keep your dirty shoes away from other items or want to keep other items away from your shoes, this shoe bag is perfect for the job.",
			"Shirt Organizer",
			"Using the plastic guide that comes with this accessory, you can fold your shirts to just the right size, then store them in the organizer to avoid wrinkles while traveling.",
			"We are confident that we can deliver all NOMATIC Travel Set rewards by January 2017.",
			"Marketing",
			"The marketing for this campaign has been performed by two different marketing agencies. The first being Matix Labs which ran throughout the entire duration of the campaign. The other was Funded Today which performed their marketing efforts from August 11th to September 1st.",
			"We love creating innovative products that help people simplify, organize and improve their lives. We are so grateful to all of our backers and supporters who helped us successfully launch the Basics Wallet and Basics Notebook on the Kickstarter Platform. Thanks for all of your support! If you have any feedback or questions please contact us through our website www.nomatic.com."

			"The following is an excerpt from ORIGIN Magazine.",
			"Interviewer: Maranda Pleasant",
			"Maranda Pleasant: What are you passionate about in life?",
			"Bellamy Young: For me, singing. I wouldn’t make it through the day without singing. It is my solace and my meditation and my release. It lets me know how I’m processing things, what I’m processing, if I’m out of touch in some area. I will just think, why am I singing? Then I will know everything I need to know about what I’m feeling.",
			"But also, kindness. That is what thrills me, personally. Small acts of kindness; thoughtful, large acts of kindness. I feel like we’re in a bit of a precipice, and I think that any beautiful energy on the kindness continuum will just help us fall into a lovelier place. From the fear and constriction that’s sort of always pulling us back and keeping us in old modalities, I feel like any expansive act of kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity, helps tip the scale toward a more conscious, liberated existence for everyone. The smallest act has repercussions for the universe.",
			"MP: How do you keep your center in the middle of chaos? Do you have a routine?",
			"BY: I have to meditate before I go to bed, always. I have to let the day go and let the eternal in. Sleep is such a potent, liminal state, and I don’t want to drag anything in there that doesn’t need to be there. I get a lot of work done in my dreams and I don’t want to take anybody else’s work with me. We all got plenty of work in this life, so for sure I have a very simple seated meditation practice before bed. But equally helpful to me is a walking meditation -- to be in nature, to not be attached to my electronics, and to just be instead of be doing. And yoga, always. The union.",
			"MP: How do you process pain, emotional pain, when it comes in?",
			"BY: I process it like a teacher. The more I resist anything, the stronger it gets. I have to welcome the pain like I welcome the joy. And the pain is always bringing me a lesson. If I listen to the lesson when the pain is manageable, the pain won’t get gargantuan and flatten me entirely, because I will have received the message at the center. I receive it as gently as I can, because the cruelest thing that I do to myself is try to push myself through an experience. If I’m feeling hurt, sad, lonely, depressed, and then I shame myself for feeling that, then that’s a black hole for me. I really have worked a lot to meet pain with both gratitude and gentleness. You gotta love yourself, because when you’re hurting -- you never know who’s gonna be around to do the lovin’ for ya. You gotta love yourself through the pain.",
			"MP: Such a joy to talk to you. What is love to you?",
			"BY: Love is a true unconditional space to me. To love someone or to be loved is to be seen, and I think, gosh, as humans, all we want is to be seen, to be heard, right? To be valued. To be respected. But mostly just to be held in a safe, unconditional space.",
			"MP: What causes on the planet are you passionate about? Anything that’s near to your heart?",
			"BY: For me, it’s adoption. I am adopted, so of course it means the world to me personally. But also even animals. There’s a lot of life on the planet that needs love, wants love, deserves love, in whatever capacity we are able. I feel it is a blessing, a duty, an honor, that we give the love that we have, and we share the lives that we have with our fullest heart. Souls finding each other and sharing love through this road. I foster a lot. Not humans, animals.",
			"MP: Let’s talk about your current project. You’re on the most loved television show right now on any network.",
			"Scandal is an unprecedented blessing in my life. I’ve never dreamed of a blessing like this -- to be in this family of people where everyone is so grateful and so hardworking, and to be given these words to say that are so honest and so complicated and so nuanced. Nothing is all good or all bad, nothing is black or white, everything is just messy and human and difficult. We’re meeting it all with our best moment but we are failing, and that is an amazing opportunity for an actor. Not to mention the monologues. The writing I have right now is unbelievable, a gift. It’s all really beautiful! Scandal is like a really, really beautiful thing. Also, this summer I’m getting a little album off the ground.",
			"MP: I did not know that!",
			"BY: It’s going to take a minute, and it’ll happen in its own time, but I feel so grateful that singing is back in my life, and that I have an opportunity for this. I’m just trying to open my heart and open some doors and let it all come together the way it’s supposed to.",
			"MP: Can you tell me a little bit about the album?",
			"BY: It’s all very, it’s all just nascent. Coming together now. The conversations are fun and evolving.",
			"MP: This has been such a pleasure.",
			"BY: It’s my pleasure."

			"Five myths about the cross  via @PostOpinions"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Christians worldwide are commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus in Good Friday worship services, followed by celebration of his resurrection on Easter Sunday. But as often as the cross appears in Christian artwork and Western culture at large, misunderstandings and myths persist as to its history, origins and image. Here are five of the most stubborn misconceptions about Christianity’s most prominent symbol.",
			"The iconic image of the Christian cross tends to feature a central vertical beam transected by a perpendicular beam about a third of the way down. This version of the cross is visible everywhere from emoji (which include both the two-beam Latin cross and the Orthodox cross, also known as the Suppedaneum cross, which has another bar near the bottom) to roadside memorials and, of course, church steeples.",
			"But the actual crosses Romans used for executions probably took a different shape. The Greek and Latin words for \"cross\" — \"stauros\" and \"crux\" — do not necessarily describe what most people imagine as a cross. They refer to an upright stake upon which the condemned could be bound with hands above their heads. Most historians surmise that Jesus’ cross was more likely to have been T-shaped, with the vertical element notched to allow executioners to tie the victim to the crossbeam, then raise it and set it securely into the top. The Tau cross, named for its resemblance to the Greek letter, has been adopted over time by various Christian orders and sects, and it probably bears a stronger resemblance to the object upon which Jesus died on than those crosses more commonly depicted in Christian art.",
			"Nearly every depiction of Jesus’ crucifixion — including masterpieces such as Sandro Botticelli’s \"Mystic Crucifixion\" and Diego Velázquez’s \"Christ Crucified\" — shows Him attached to the cross by nails through his palms and his feet.",
			"The New Testament Gospels do not, however, directly say that Jesus was nailed to the cross. In fact, the only reference to such nails in the Gospels comes from the book of John and the story of doubting Thomas, who asks to see the marks of the nails in Jesus’ hands to confirm that he is really encountering the resurrected Christ (John 20:25). The tradition that Jesus was nailed to the cross may also derive from the passage in some translations of Psalm 21:16 that says, \"They pierce my hands and feet.\"",
			"Yet, while some physical evidence for nailing the feet of crucifixion victims has been found by archaeologists, it would have been impossible to fix the condemned to a cross by nails alone, since the bones in the hands or wrists would not have supported the weight of the body. Rather, Romans would have at least also tied victims’ wrists to the crossbeam, or perhaps draped their arms over the back of the beam and secured them with ropes. Suffocation, rather than loss of blood, would be the cause of death.",
			"The Gospel of John states that Jesus bore the cross by himself (John 19:17) to a hill called Golgotha, while the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke claim that authorities compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, to carry the cross for Him, presumably because the flogging He had received had left Him too weak to carry it. In either case, most depictions in Christian art (including renditions by Michelangelo, El Greco and Titian) show either man carrying a large, wooden cross with both a vertical and a horizontal beam.",
			"Yet Romans generally had the upright beam already set up at the place of execution. To the extent that the condemned carried their own crosses, they would have been given only the horizontal piece, according to historians of ancient execution methods, including LaGrange College professor John Granger Cook.",
			"\"For almost 1,000 years, the Christian church emphasized paradise, not Crucifixion,\" two authors wrote in UU World magazine; in Slate, scholar Larry Hurtado claimed that \"there was, in short, little to be gained in proclaiming a crucified saviour in that setting in which crucifixion was a grisly reality,\" noting that \"some early Christians tried to avoid reference to Jesus’ crucifixion.\"",
			"It is true that crosses were extremely rare symbols for Christians to use before the mid-4th century. Moreover, the first images of crosses portray them more as slender, gemmed staffs than as sturdy instruments of execution. Depictions of Jesus’ crucifixion were even more rare, not occurring with any regularity until the 6th century.",
			"Yet there’s a reason this is surprising: Christian authors, poets and preachers wrote and spoke at great length about the significance and meaning of Jesus’ death on the cross. In the 2nd century, Christian thinker Justin Martyr wrote that \"when they crucified Him, driving in the nails, they pierced His hands and feet; and those who crucified Him parted His garments among themselves,\" emphasizing the humiliation and suffering of Jesus’ execution in a long dialogue with a non-Christian interlocutor. Tertullian, another prolific early Christian writer, also meditated at length on the crucifixion and its theological meaning.",
			"While explaining the cross or crucifix’s absence from visual art may be difficult, timing its appearance with the rise of pilgrimage to the Holy Land and the sites of Jesus’ life, death and resurrection provides helpful clues. By the end of the 4th century, pilgrims were traveling to Jerusalem, where they could visit Golgotha and venerate a relic of the \"true cross,\" supposedly discovered by the Roman Empress Helena. Some even were privileged to receive a fragment of the holy wood. The image of the cross and the crucifix may be linked with pilgrims’ desire to re-create the scene in its historical setting, and the proliferation of cross images in the West may have to do with the cross-related souvenirs some pilgrims brought back.",
			"This idea has some convinced followers. According to Jehovah’s Witnesses, for example, various authorities \"have linked the cross with nature worship and pagan sex rites.\" The Church of the Great God, another denomination, likewise claims that \"long before the coming of Christ, pagans used the cross as a religious symbol.\"",
			"Yet there is no evidence that Christians intentionally borrowed the cross from pre-Christian cultic symbols.",
			"While it is true that many ancient religions used symbols similar to the cross (and that Egyptian Christians even adapted the ankh, a hieroglyph for \"life\"), two intersecting lines are a simple and very common figure. This makes it difficult to assert that early Christians consciously adopted a particular sign rather than inventing one specifically referring to their unique story of Jesus’ death upon a cross. While it is easy to see similarities in religious artwork from various traditions, it is also easy enough to locate distinctions among them. The Christian cross, with all its associated symbols (anchors, letters, ploughs and more), is a distinct feature of Christian art."

			"Looking out the window of a plane – with many hours to burn and a god-like perspective of the world – can get you pondering some of life’s big questions: Are we alone in the universe? How did it all begin? Is there purpose to our existence? Wait, what are those little holes in airplane windows?",
			"Thanks to the curious mind of Robbie Gonzalez from io9 , the latter of those questions might be answered. After finding no sturdy answer on internet forums, he decided to track down a copy of a maintenance manual for the Boeing 737 on Wikileaks and contact Marlowe Moncur, Director of Technology for GKN Aerospace, the world leader in passenger cabin window design development.",
			"As you might have already guessed, it’s to do with regulating pressure.",
			"He found that most cabin windows consist of outer, middle and inner panes – all of which are made of a superstrong synthetic resin. Typically, it’s the middle pane that has the mysterious little hole.",
			"Only the outer and middle panes are actually structural, while the inner is pretty much there as failsafe and to protect the other layers. Moncur said it’s only there to maintain cabin pressure in the extremely rare event that the outer pane becomes fractured.",
			"Cruising at 10,600 meters (35,000 feet), the pressure is around 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) per square inch. This is too low for the human body to stay conscious, so the pressure is artificially maintained at around 3.5 kilograms (8 pounds) per square inch. But of course, if you increase pressure inside, the structure has to be strong to hold the difference between the external pressure and internal pressure.",
			"The outer pane is the thickest of these and is the primary layer that bears the pressure of the cabin. According to Gonzalez, the little hole is there to act as \"as a bleed valve, allowing pressure between the air in the passenger cabin and the air between the outer and middle panes to equilibrate.\" Simply put, it ensures that only the strongest outer pane is bearing the pressure, leaving the middle pane available in case of an emergency.",
			"Phew, now that problem’s solved, go work on creating lasting nuclear fusion .",

			"Why people constantly ask this woman if she's married to her dad"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Updated Nov. 30, 2013",
			"That awkward moment when people think you and your dad are married.",
			"And that's not just rhetorical Internet speak.",
			"My parents and I just got back from a cruise to the Bahamas and two people on separate occasions asked me if I was my dad's wife. What's more, a Peruvian ship worker also asked us, \"Is that your daughter? But she looks like a China woman!\" And a presumably respectful Southern gentleman asked me, after seeing me with my parents, if I was \"like a Cambodian victim of sex trafficking?\"",
			"That one was really the cherry on top of my Piña Colada.",
			"These questions are all particularly anathema to me because I actually write for a living about the global subjugation of women. So I am very certain that I'm not my dad's mail-order Asian bride and that my mom is not my sex trafficking captor.",
			"My parents, who are 61 years old, white and live in Iowa, adopted me from Seoul, South Korea after I was left on the doorsteps of an orphanage when I was a day old. I'm not a unique case -- after the Korean War ended in 1953, many moms in South Korea abandoned their newborns in a society that would ostracize an unwed woman who had a child.",
			"There are complex stereotypes regarding race, gender, prejudice, and privilege that arise when people ask us whether we are married -- namely the inculcated archetype regarding the \"creepy\" older white man man and the younger, submissive Asian woman.",
			"Society's view on this is simply not something I want to be reminded of when I'm hanging out with my dad.",
			"I'm not saying I'm free of my own biases or I adhere to some supreme level of moral rectitude, but since it's National Adoption Awareness Month (granted, it's domestic-focused) and this type of prejudice is not endemic to a cruise ship but rather something that happens to many Asian adoptees, I thought I'd make a small request. I think it'd be best, guys, if we could stop labeling and perpetuating stereotypes because, well, just look at what happens: awkwardness for everyone involved.",
			"My sister-in-law, dad, brother, cutest nephew ever, mom, me.",
			"Now, it might seem easy to attribute these statements to the \"type\" of people who go on this \"type\" of vacation.",
			"A cruise is, of course, probably about the least authentic way to travel. There is no farm-to-table fare, no architecture steeped in history. The completely curated activities and cheesy over-the-top theatrical tone of a cruise relegates it to steerage in the ranks of traveling. Fine, but it is a fun vacation for families. Plus, I was veritably unable to check email for a week, so I had a great time.",
			"But I will say this cruise I went on was not prototypical. On board, we mostly hung out in an unassuming whiskey lounge with dark wood and went to shows and a classy-enough art auction. The cruise left from a port in New York and was a week-long home to an eclectic mix of socioeconomic statuses and races. Old-money-Upper-East-Siders complained about how the food was \"teahrible.\" Russian families three generations strong ate Japanese teppanyaki with precocious daughters looking squarely in their parent's eyes telling them \"Nyet\" (No). Italian women loudly compared their commutes from Staten Island into the city. And a largely Filipino and Peruvian boat crew told me about the new food they ate on the boat -- like spaghetti carbonara.",
			"But as I describe these passengers above, it's clear I'm just as prone to stereotyping others as anyone else is. And these subtle, nuanced observations can be more insidious than overtly offensive statements such as racial slurs -- which are vivid and salient in their wrongness. These more latent forms of bias can slowly build undetected. Creating awareness and actively trying not to do this takes work.",
			"To be sure, this post isn't some culturally elitist screed meant to elicit comments like \"'Murica, fu*k yeah.\" This is no uproarious David Foster Wallace piece, \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,\" in which he derisively mocks the low-brow nature of a cruise he took with statements such as, \"I have seen 500 upscale Americans dance the Electric Slide. I have seen sunsets that looked computer-enhanced. I have (very briefly) joined a conga line.\"",
			"All of this caused him to basically have an existential crisis. I guess I can be thankful all that didn't happen to me.",
			"I am actually pointing out that on this racially diverse boat, people from all over the world projected stereotypes toward Asian women and white men.",
			"Ever one to lighten the mood, my hilarious, intelligent mom said, \"Well, what if you and I are an item, and Dad is just the beard?\"",
			"But that would simply never happen because that's not a social construct society has formed a consensus on.",
			"When I was younger, I wanted to go places strictly with my dad, because he had brown hair and I thought I resembled him more than my strawberry-blonde mom. As a Korean adoptee in a homogenous Midwest community, I thought I blended in more this way. Now, the reality is that the opposite is true.",
			"The cruise isn't the first time something like this has happened. A few years ago, I lived with my parents outside of Chicago when I was in grad school for journalism. My dad and I were at some event and I was producing a radio segment, when a local politician -- you know, those public figures in whom we place all our trust -- asked if my dad and I were married. I remember neighbors asking, too. It's just uncomfortable.",
			"But beyond being uncomfortable, these questions are also distressing because they bring up issues from childhood that have shaped who you are. It's a reminder of feeling like an outsider and wanting to fit in. And it's a reminder that you probably overcompensate because of it. It's a reminder that growing up and not seeing anyone who looks like you can make you dislike or be disinterested in your own ethnicity. It's a reminder that you realized -- early on in life -- that the world is such an imperfect place that a mother could be forced to give up her child. And that is all personally painful to think about.",
			"But it all also probably made you more of a soul-searcher.",
			"Nicole Soojung recently wrote for Bitch Magazine about whether race should be discussed among adoptees, pointing out that some parents opt for a \"colorblind\" approach. She said that a mother who adopted a son told her: \"I don't see my son's color. Race is just not an issue for us.\"",
			"But race in relation to adoption is an issue, precisely for reasons like what happened on our cruise. And apparently it's not an issue only families of adopted kids should talk about -- it's something everybody should.",
			"So big picture, let's try not to uphold prejudices and stereotypes because look what happens -- people ask you if you're married to your dad."

			"Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX), joined by Tax Police Subcommittee Chairman Peter Roskam (R-IL), sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions requesting an investigation into allegations that Lerner used her division’s power to target American citizens’ applications for non-profit status, or political action committees, based upon the citizen’s political beliefs.",
			"\"Taxpayers deserve to know that the DOJ’s previous evaluation was not tainted by politics,\" the two chairmen wrote in the letter obtained by Breitbart Texas. \"We respectfully request the Department of Justice to take a fresh look at the evidence presented in the attached referral in order to restore taxpayers’ trust in the IRS.\"",
			"Brady and Roskam sent information to the U.S. Attorney General disclosing findings of a three-year investigation by their committee that uncovered \"evidence of willful misconduct on the part of Ms. Lerner.\"",
			"\"Despite this fact, and for what many believe were purely partisan reasons, the prior Administration refused to review Ms. Lerner’s misconduct,\" they explained. \"In particular, the Committee found that Ms. Lerner used her position to improperly influence IRS action against conservative organizations, denying these groups due process and equal protection rights under the law.\"",
			"\"The Committee also found she impeded official investigations by providing misleading statements in response to questions from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration,\" the letter to Sessions continues. \"Finally, Lerner risked exposing, and may actually have disclosed, confidential taxpayer information, in apparent violation of Internal Revenue Code section 6103 by using her personal email to conduct official business.\"",
			"In August 2016, Breitbart News reported that the House voted to hold Lerner in Contempt of Congress for her refusal to testify before a House Oversight Committee hearing in May 2013. The article disclosed information contained in 302 FBI documents revealing possible illegal conduct by Lerner and others in the IRS.",
			"Commenting on Obama’s Justice Department’s failure to take action, the letter from the two tax chairmen states, \"Disturbingly, in February 2014, while the investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) was ongoing, President Obama stated there was ‘not a smidgeon of corruption’ at the IRS, preempting a fair investigation in which he had political equities.\"",

			"Like Kobe beef and halibut sushi, much of what you see labeled as jamon iberico is not what you think it is. Though the narrative of acorn-fattened pigs roaming the woodlands of western Spain is popular, it appears to be a misleading one: Most ibe1rico pigs spend their short, unremarkable lives slopping up provender on factory farms.",
			"Since the price and quality of jamon iberico vary widely—high-end examples can fetch more than $200 a pound—Spain’s Ministry of Agriculture rolled out designations a few years back that minimize the guesswork. White, green, and red tags denote pork that’s typically mixed-breed and frequently fed with grain, not acorns. Purebred, acorn-fed iberico pigs are tagged with black labels.",
			"Outside the Iberian Peninsula, where shoppers are less conversant in Spanish ham-speak, the color-coded tags will likely prove useful. Roughly 20,000 tons of the black-hoofed hams were exported last year alone, up 25 percent from the year before. Eighty percent of exported iberico goes to EU countries such as Germany, Italy, Portugal, and France. Japan, the U.S., and Mexico make up the majority of the remaining 20 percent. ",
			"But there is a movement in the U.S. to develop its own American versions of the world's most exclusive cured meat. Acornseekers, based in Flatonia, Texas, was the first to bring Iberico pigs, a breed indigenous to Spain and Portugal, to the U.S. for commercial production. La Quercia, an Iowa-based farm that sells its pork to high-end shops such as Eataly and Murray's in New York, has its own \"acorn proscuitto,\" made from nut-foraging Missouri Tamworth pigs. And on Feb. 5, Georgia-based  White Oak Pastures held a dinner to celebrate its first harvest—featuring its pigs flown in from the dehesa savannas in southwest Spain—and included chefs from Spain who led the preparations.",
			"Compared with conventional hogs, the indigenous Iberian species matures far more slowly, bears smaller litters, yields less meat, and requires vast swaths of acorn-rich pastureland (the Spanish government mandates at least five acres per animal). Which is why, according to the Asociacion Nacional de Industria de Carne de España, the largest association representing the Spanish meat industry, 95 percent of jamon labeled as iberico is actually mixed-breed. And why authentic jamon iberico is so much pricier.",
			"With that in mind, here are five questions to ask before your next jamon purchase if you’re seeking quality over price, whether traditional Spanish or the newest American offerings: ",
			"Breed: Was the pig pure-breed or mixed?",
			"Diet: Was it fed wild acorns or industrial fodder?",
			"Lifestyle: Was it free-range or farmed?",
			"Curing: Was it three years (the minimum for pure-breed iberico) or 700 days (the minimum for cross-breed)?",
			"Lifespan: Did the pig enjoy one or two years of grazing? If the latter, it leads to a more complex final product.",
			"Avelino Garcia, a bespectacled charcutero who’s been carving ham in Madrid’s Pacifico market since 1970, said his customers spring for the acorn-fed stuff on holidays and special occasions only, for the most part. \"Sure, we’ve come a long way since the dime-a-dozen chorizo sandwiches of the Franco era, but jamon iberico will always be a luxury product.\"",

			"\"There’s something going on there,\" Trump told MSNBC's Morning Joe in November when asked whether Islam is a violent religion. \"There’s something definitely going on.\"",
			"Uscinski noted that Trump has used the tactic throughout his campaign to gain support by appealing to voters' fears and cynicism.",

			"Every Kickstarter project wants to meet its fundraising goal. But a new study suggests that raising a ton of money doesn't predict how much success a crowdfunding project will ultimately find. ",
			"Researchers at North Carolina State University found that the number of people who supported a project on Kickstarter — rather than how much money the project raked in — was the real indicator of whether a product would succeed. ",
			"The study, published this month in the journal Research Policy, followed 1,000 successful Kickstarter campaigns in technology, product design, hardware and video games. All participants who responded raised at least $10,000 from an average of 1,078 backers. ",
			"SEE ALSO: 3.5 million people supported Kickstarter projects in 2016",
			"\"The first key finding was that the amount of money a crowdfunding entrepreneur raised was inconsequential to their product’s ultimate success in the market,\" lead researcher Michael Stanko said in a statement. ",
			"For one, raising a lot more money didn't make founders any more likely to meet their goals for sales or profit once they entered the marketplace. That was because the difference in funding wasn't enough to help founders spend more on advertising or do anything else that would actually translate into more sales.",
			"Beyond that, raising extra money indicated that founders started to lose focus and stop innovating on bigger ideas. Faced with the pressure of a massively successful Kickstarter campaign, founders started to get slightly overwhelmed. ",
			"SEE ALSO: Vegans, this plant-based leather wallet is made just for you",
			"The only factor that actually indicated how successful a product would be when it moved beyond Kickstarter? How many backers it had. ",
			"Another study this year found that crowdfunding did help founders in parts of the country besides New York and Silicon Valley nab funding from venture capitalists. ",
			"So don't sweat it if your big idea doesn't meet its Kickstarter fundraising goal. It's all about exposure — to more backers, and to the big money paying attention. "

		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Do you wish your job offered more opportunities to travel, but also had more to do with a giant potato? Maybe a job driving the Big Idaho Potato Truck is the career you’ve been looking for.",
			"The promotional vehicle, which consists of a semi cab hauling a 12-foot-tall replica potato, travels around the United States to draw attention to the prize spuds of Idaho. Operated by the Idaho Potato Commission, the truck is currently on its fifth annual tour of the country. Funding concerns mean this could be the last year, but a recent, unexpected endorsement from Kobe Bryant—he name-dropped the truck in an ESPN interview—may have helped secure its future.",
			"To find out what life on the road with the Big Potato is really like we spoke with Larry Bathe, who is not only the current driver of the trailer, but has been with the project since the very beginning.",
			"The Big Idaho Potato Truck first hit the road in 2012, as a promotional tour commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Idaho Potato Commission. As Bathe told us, the idea for the truck came from Linda Kaufman of marketing company Foerstel Design, who was inspired by an old novelty postcard that showed an impossibly massive potato on the back of a flatbed.",
			"Bathe, a lifelong truck driver, was brought in to help figure out exactly how to create and pilot a giant potato around the country. Originally, the huge tater was set to be 16 feet tall, and hold a museum inside, but at that scale it wouldn’t have fit under most bridges. The potato creators scaled the tater back to its current 12-foot-tall size, and began to test drive it, which is when Bathe first took the wheel.",
			"The truck did its first nine-month tour in 2012, mostly visiting grocery stores to hand out information on Idaho spuds. That was supposed to be the extent of its service celebrating the Potato Commission’s anniversary, but the vehicle proved so popular that it was allowed to hit the road again in 2013. More and more venues began requesting that the truck make an appearance, from Nascar events to the Kentucky Derby. After the Big Idaho Potato Truck’s second tour it had gained so much notice that the program was given a three-year contract, 2016 being its final guaranteed year.",
			"\"Some people love it in the commission, and some people don’t, or at least they act like they don’t,\" says Bathe. \"But in the end we win them over pretty easily.\" Despite yearly funding worries, the Big Idaho Potato Truck continues chugging along. Having turned down the first two tours to be with his family, Bathe returned to the truck tour in 2014. He has driven the potato every year since.",
			"According to Bathe, driving around with the heavy carb load is both challenging and rewarding. The potato is 12 feet wide and 28 feet long, making it nearly impossible to see what’s directly behind it. \"It’s difficult for mirrors to see behind it, so I don’t have an idea of the traffic pattern [behind the truck],\" says Bathe. Turning the huge tater is also a challenge, that Bathe nearly always has to navigate by instinct and experience.",
			"But the driver of the Big Idaho Potato Truck is not alone. There are also two other \"ambassadors\" on board who look after the logistics of the tour. In addition to the responsibility to interact with the public that each of the potato team shares, one of the ambassadors takes care of photography, video, and other documentation, while the other looks after social media and managing the venues and locations. It takes a team to drive a six-ton potato.",
			"All three of the team ride in the cab while they are on the road, but the Big Potato itself isn’t empty. \"You can’t have something that can’t be inspected inside, be as big as that potato,\" says Bathe. To allow for this, there is a door in the potato that leads to the hollow insides which have been fitted with shelves and lockers for the potato team to store their stuff.",
			"Even with the close quarters and the challenges of driving a giant potato around, Bathe loves his gig. \"The amount of people that wave at you every day when you’re driving the Big Idaho Potato is just outrageous,\" he says. \"I get thumbs up, waves, people taking pictures. It’s just a feel-good job.\"",
			"Since each year could possibly be the last for the truck, its overseers have ended up filling the positions last minute. But Bathe hopes that this will change as the popularity of the Big Potato Truck grows, along with its crew. Oscar Mayer’s promotional, giant-hot-dog-shaped Wienermobile is 80 years old, Bathe points out. The Big Potato \"is just five years old. It’s just getting going.\""

			"Courtney Barnes, a 32-year-old Instagram model who is also reportedly a college graduate with an economics degree, has a very simple goal in life: \"I want to show men, women, and children that it is possible to be beautiful, smart, and have a big ass.\"",
			"To reach that goal, Barnes—who goes by the name Miss Miami—regularly posts photos like this on IG in addition to working as a cam girl, party host, brand ambassador, and more:",
			"I BET you won't play me in  Tennis, I'll take your Lil measly dollars & walk off like a model",
			"A photo posted by MsMiami (@damn_msmiami) on Jan 12, 2017 at 2:48pm PST",
			"But before you decide, \"Hey, that sounds like a pretty cool profession, I’m going to try it out,\" know this: Barnes, who is the proud owner of a 59-inch backside, nearly died trying to achieve the figure that she has today.",
			"In a video produced by Barcroft Media, Barnes spoke at length about her now-legendary booty and admitted to getting it by attending illegal \"pumping parties.\" At those parties, she allowed a woman to inject three rounds of illegal butt shots into her booty. She realizes it probably wasn’t the smartest thing to do, but it worked for her.",
			"A photo posted by MsMiami (@damn_msmiami) on Nov 9, 2016 at 3:28pm PST",
			"\"It was a risk I was willing to take at the time and I was lucky not to have any complications,\" she said. \"I was naive and I admit I didn’t know what I was putting into my body, but at the time, a lot of women in Florida were getting it done, and I found a local woman who could do it.\"",
			"Barnes also admitted that she doesn’t actually know what’s inside of her butt at the moment.",
			"I can tell that you want me BABE, I can tell that you need it",
			"A photo posted by MsMiami (@damn_msmiami) on Jan 14, 2017 at 10:29am PST",
			"\"These are very dangerous products that are being injected,\" she said. \"I don’t know for sure what they injected me with. But when I got it, she said it was like some hydrogel, some kind of silicone that they normally put in gummy bear implants. You don’t know how your body is going to react. It is still something foreign that’s in your body. It’s a gamble. A close friend of mine got it removed and she ended up having to have blood transfusions and she was in the hospital for months. It was a nightmare for her.\"",
			"Miami ",
			"A photo posted by MsMiami (@damn_msmiami) on Oct 5, 2016 at 1:48pm PDT",
			"And just in case all of that isn’t scary enough, a plastic surgeon named Dr. Constantino Mendieta also spoke about Barnes’ butt and explained the dangers associated with it even though she hasn’t showed any signs of health problems just yet:",
			"\"I’m unfortunately seeing more and more of these cases of silicone injections to the buttock. People are going to these underground ‘pumping parties,’ and they are getting these injections that aren’t really FDA approved or anything like that. The dangers with these injections is that people are using different kinds of products, and the product that they use has different consistencies...So you have no idea what’s being done.",
			"Courtney was not alone. She has no clue how much was injected, she has no clue what was injected...Many people are asking me, ‘Are these injections dangerous?’ The answer is yes. They are dangerous because the injections are given into the vein that goes into the lungs and people have died. So there is an immediate danger to it, but then there is a long-term danger. She is starting to get some skin changes in the buttock area. So I think Courtney is headed for some problems down the road.\"",
			"Problems that could prevent her from reaching her goal. Check out the video above to hear more about the issues Barnes is facing, even though she escaped many of the immediate risks associated with pumping who knows what into her butt."

Chris Murphy announced his surprise filibuster in support of gun safety laws Wednesday, his commitment to resisting a bathroom break for hours on end was probably the first thing many observers thought of. It made a person wonder: How long would I go without peeing in order to force a vote on gun laws?",
			"As Murphy’s speech stretched to 6 hours, then 10, then 14, even New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker had to remark on the inspiring fortitude of the man’s bladder",
			"And then, this morning, the New York Times dropped a bombshell : According to reporter David Herszenhorn, Murphy actually could go to the bathroom during his filibuster!",
			"Herszenhorn writes:",
			"Under Senate rules, once a senator is recognized on the floor and gains control of debate, she or he can hold it as long as humanly possible—a part of the Senate’s long tradition of unlimited debate. Refusing to relinquish the floor for any other Senate action, a filibuster typically requires standing there and speaking. But the rules also allow the senator to yield the floor, without giving up control, for questions or comments from colleagues, a strategy that Mr. Murphy used repeatedly on Wednesday and into Thursday morning.",
			"This allowed fellow Democrats, like his Connecticut counterpart, Senator Richard Blumenthal, to take over for substantial chunks of time, offering lengthy commentaries that made forceful and emotional points about gun violence in America but, more important for Mr. Murphy, allowed him to take bathroom breaks.",
			"Note the plural, please. Bathroom breaks! How often was this guy peeing, exactly?",
			"I reached out to David Herszenhorn for clarification as to whether or not Murphy was merely allowed to relieve himself during his filibuster, or whether he actually did. Herszenhorn replied, \"His staff says he did not but I can't say for sure. I'm writing around it.\" The Times story was subsequently updated to say, \"Mr. Murphy could have taken a quick break, but he never left the floor and did not go to the bathroom throughout the 15 hours, according to a spokeswoman for the senator, Laura Maloney.\"",
			"A different spokeswoman told me the same thing. However, that still leaves open the question of what Murphy was allowed to do. After all, if a senator declines the opportunity to go to the bathroom during a filibuster even though he can, does it still count as proof of his commitment to the cause, or does it become a senseless act of masochism?",
			"To find out, I called the Senate parliamentarian’s office, which advises the Senate on the rules governing what senators can and cannot do. I spoke to a source who declined to speak for attribution but provided an authoritative answer nonetheless.",
			"\"We advised Senator Murphy that he needed to stay standing and stay in the chamber,\" my source said. \"Rule 19 of the Standing Rules of the Senate says that if the senator desires to be speak and be recognized, he shall rise and address the presiding officer. So he needs to stay standing.\"",
			"Ah, I thought to myself—but a man can pee standing up! Not so fast, wise guy.",
			"\"He needs to stay in the chamber,\" the source clarified. \"Otherwise how do we know if he’s standing?\"",
			"Yielding for questions, I was told, does not solve the problem: \"You still have to hold the floor. ... You can yield for questions, but you still have to hold the floor to entertain a question or answer the question, which means you have to stay standing and stay in the chamber.\""

		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Seven years ago a study made headlines for finding that men with older brothers are more likely to be gay. Today the study has resurfaced as researchers extend upon the original findings by looking deeper into the possible biological basis of homosexuality.",
			"Published in New Scientist magazine, the 2006 study was conducted by sexologist Anthony Bogaert, a Community Health Sciences chair and professor at Ontario's Brock University. His research led him to conclude that having more older brothers makes it more likely a man will be gay. Each older brother raises the odds of homosexuality by a third, potentially going from a 3 percent chance with the first son to a 6 percent chance with the fourth.",
			"Bogaert studied 944 gay and straight men, including some who were raised with non-biological male siblings, to pit prenatal against postnatal factors. His research, which reappeared in a Sept. 4 New Scientist article, ultimately determined that fraternal birth order seems to have a connection to sexual orientation. \"That means for each male gestation that occurs, something changes in a woman’s body that makes her more likely to give birth to a gay son,\" as Brock University explains Bogaert's findings.",
			"An abstract from the study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, summarizes the research:",
			"Only biological older brothers, and not any other sibling characteristic, including nonbiological older brothers, predicted men’s sexual orientation, regardless of the amount of time reared with these siblings. These results strongly suggest a prenatal origin to the fraternal birth-order effect.",
			"Today, Bogaert is looking to determine that prenatal origin.",
			"\"[The 2006 study] was an important study and it does suggest there is probably a biological basis to the older brother effect,\" he told The Huffington Post during a phone conversation from Canada Thursday afternoon. \"It's an important study in the context of sex orientation development. We have additional research going on right now testing specifically the underlying biological effect of the older brother. ... There are no results yet. We are collecting samples of mothers of gay men and comparing them to mothers of heterosexual men and looking to see if there is evidence of a biological factor that differs between the two groups.\"",
			"Bogaert explained that the 2006 study never determined a specific \"mechanism\" -- a biological factor or process -- behind the older brother effect. He suggested this mechanism could be a maternal immune response, a hormone change in the womb, a gestational factor during pregnancy or even genes.",
			"\"The 2006 study really strongly suggests that there is biological mechanism but it never really tested the specific mechanism itself in terms of determining what factor is in fact influencing a change in a mother's development during pregnancy,\" he explained to HuffPost. \"What we're doing now is we're looking at the specific mechanism and seeing if we can find evidence for that. We have a study looking at ... mothers of gay and heterosexual men and seeing if there is a maternal immune response. So, that's something very unique and new.\"",
			"Bogaert says that isolating the exact biological mechanism or process will support the \"nature\" side of the Nature v. Nurture debate. If successful, his new research could provide a biological backing for homosexuality.",
			"\"I think there's strong evidence that people who believe that there's a biological basis to sexual orientation tend to be more tolerant to sexual minorities, and that's one of the more positive [possible] social outcomes,\" he said. \"And I am in that camp. I don't believe that homosexuality is a disorder or immoral.\"",
			"The overarching purpose of the new study is to delve deeper into the origins of sexuality. Bogaert says he is trying to understand sexual variability, human sexuality and sexual orientation as a piece of the larger puzzle.",
			"\"Unerstanding the biological mechanisms may have some social ramifications, and for me that's great if it ends up being positive,\" he added. \"But a larger motivation is just trying to understand sexuality, and understanding sexuality has its own benefits from a scientific perspective.\""

			"8 Truly Untranslatable German Words"
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Weltschmerz",
			"\"Werner Herzog, who understands more than just about anyone the terror of a cold and irrational universe, got some mileage out of remaking Nosferatu in 1979 by keeping what worked in the novel and in Murnau’s 1922 film and leaning heavily into the vampire’s weltschmerz.\" ",
			"A feeling of sentimental sadness or pessimism",
			"the weariness that comes with knowing that the world is going to let you down no matter what and there’s nothing you can do to stop it: this is what the Germans succinctly call Weltschmerz.",
			"Weltschmerz, or literally \"world-pain\" or \"world-weariness,\" first appeared in German in 1827 and was born out of the melancholy and pessimistic Romantic literary movement taking place in Germany at the time. It was coined by the author Jean Paul—born Johann Paul Friedrich Richter—in his novel Selina, where he used it to refer to Lord Byron’s disaffected loathing for the world. The word was popularized by Heinrich Heine not long after, who moved the word’s meaning away from active loathing and toward sentimental apathy. Weltschmerz was borrowed into English in the 1860s and while it has lost its direct tie to 19th-century Romanticism, it does retain a bit of the formality of its original uses. ",
			"Schadenfreude",
			"You’re on your way to work. There’s this jerk who’s weaving in and out of stop-and-go traffic in bursts of 50 mph. Cutting people off, riding people’s bumpers, even splitting the lane to get mere feet ahead of everyone else. They race up behind you and nearly rear-end you, then speed off up the shoulder. Five minutes and one mile down the road, you see flashing lights: the jerk’s been pulled over for reckless driving. That broad smile on your face as you pass the scene is a result of schadenfreude.",
			"A popular lookup on our site, schadenfreude is a noun that refers to the joy you might feel at another person’s pain. It’s a compound of the German noun Schaden, which means \"damage,\" and freude, which means \"joy.\" We know that the word was in use in the mid-1700s in Germany, where it appears in a few books with tales intended for children. It was popular in Germany: discussed by Schopenhauer, Kant, and Nietzsche, as well as used by Goethe, schadenfreude shows up in psychology books, literature for children, and critical theory for over 100 years before it appears in English. Why the late adoption into English? Early citations for the word in English indicate that schadenfreude was thought to be a shameful defect first of Germans, and then of humanity in general. In short, the feeling was unworthy, and therefore so was the word. ",
			"Schadenfreude was favored mostly among English-speaking academics until the early 1990s, when it was introduced to more general audiences by The Simpsons. In an episode that aired in October, 1991, Lisa explains what schadenfreude is to Homer, who is gloating at his neighbor’s failure. \"Boy,\" he marvels, \"those Germans have a word for everything.\" After that episode aired, we saw a steady increase in the written use of schadenfreude in English. ",
			"Schwärmerei",
			"Though less common in English prose than many of the other words on this list, schwärmerei is another word we’ve co-opted from German. But unlike other German loanwords, schwärmerei isn’t all doom and gloom. The word refers to excessive and unbridled enthusiasm or sentiment.",
			"Schwärmerei ultimately comes from the German verb schwärmen, which means \"to swarm.\" When Schwärmerei (with the umlaut) first appeared in German as a noun, it referred to the frenzied activity of bees swarming. In time, both schwärmen and Schwärmerei came to refer to any enthusiastic activity or feeling.",
			"Ironically, it wasn’t a particularly welcome word when it first appeared in English. Our earliest use of it in print is from the Edinburgh Review in 1845: \"His mind is both clear and strong, free from schwärmerei, (a word untranslatable, because the thing itself is un-English,) free from cant and affectation of all kinds.\" Once Schwärmerei came into English, it lost the umlaut and the initial capital that marked it as a German word and became schwarmerei. It usually gets it brief moment in the sun every spring during the National Spelling Bee, where it is one of the more difficult words that gets spelled in competition.",
			"Meanwhile, in German, Schwärmerei still refers to excessive enthusiasm or sentimentality, but it’s gained another meaning: it is one of the German words used for what we call puppy love.",
			"Doppelgänger",
			"Jean Paul (a.k.a. Johann Paul Richter) is also credited with coining another German word that we’ve borrowed into English: doppelgänger.",
			"The German Romantic movement of the late 1700s and early 1800s was a reaction against the rationalism of the age before, and as such, it ended up producing some literature and drama that focused on nature, individualism, and the unexplainable or supernatural. The doppelgänger is one aspect of the supernatural that took on new life during German Romanticism.",
			"A doppelgänger is an apparition from German folklore: the spirit double of a living person. To meet your own doppelgänger is a bad omen, and a sign that your death is imminent. Richter coined the word for something a little less sinister: in his 1796 novel Siebenkäs, the main character meets and talks to his alter ego, which Richter calls a Doppelgänger (or \"double-goer\" in German). But Richter’s word was used in German literature to refer to the spirit double. Doppelgängers showed up quite a bit in Romantic horror literature, and English adopted the word in the mid-1800s.",
			"The sinister connotations of doppelgänger have fallen to the wayside in recent years in English",
			"we generally use the word to refer to someone who looks a lot like another person instead of implying that one of those two people is a spirit double of the other. ",
			"Poltergeist",
			"Say the word poltergeist to Americans of a certain age, and they will immediately parrot back to you the iconic line from the 1982 movie called Poltergeist: \"They’re heeeeeeeere.\"",
			"The English word poltergeist predates the horror classic by about 140 years, first showing up in print in an 1848 book called The Night Side of Nature, or, Ghosts and Ghost Seers by Catherine Crowe. In that book, poltergeists are associated with German spirits, which makes sense: the German word Poltergeist dates back to the 16th century and appears frequently in the writings of Martin Luther, who is most famous for starting the Protestant Reformation. In fact, it’s possible that Luther was the one to coin the German word: he used it when describing events that people believed were caused by playful or mischievous spirits—Poltergeister. The word derives from the German verb poltern, which means \"to knock or rattle,\" and the noun Geist, which means \"ghost.\" ",
			"The English word poltergeist was, from its first appearance, associated with a whole host of phenomena. Crowe’s book retells several stories of ghosts that purportedly threw crockery on the floor, knocked over glasses and jam jars and clocks, and shattered bottles of rum and wine, and whose activity seemed to be attached to a specific person. ",
			"It’s not as though there was a sudden and meteoric rise in hauntings in the 1800s",
			"rather, there was sudden interest in them, helped along, no doubt, by the spiritualist movement, which came into prominence around the same time that the English word poltergeist did.",
			"Foosball",
			"If you’ve ever watched a TV show that’s set at a frat house, it’s likely you’ve seen people play foosball. It’s a table-based game that’s based (very loosely) on soccer, where players try to hit a small ball into their opponent’s goal by turning rods with wooden figures on them and \"kicking\" the ball \"downfield.\" ",
			"The word Foosball is an anglicized spelling of the German Fußball, which literally translates to \"foot ball.\" The origins of foosball, also called table soccer or table football are a little murky, but we can find evidence of patent applications for games called table football going back to 1891. According to one history of the game, west German firms began making tabletop \"kicker\" games after World War II, and the game gained popularity in Europe and abroad. The game became nationally known in the 1960s, when it became a competitive club sport. This is also around the time that foosball entered English.",
			"While the game in Germany may have been called Tischfußball, or \"table football,\" the shortened and anglicized foosball didn’t show up in English until 1966, when it was used in another patent filing. ",
			"Kindergarten",
			"Some German nouns have naturalized so well that we hardly think of them as foreigners. Kindergarten is one such word. The German word means, literally, \"children’s garden,\" and it was an invention of Friedrich Froebel, a German educator.",
			"Froebel was a 19th-century educator in Germany and something of a mystic. As he taught, he came to believe that education for young children was lacking: most young children were put in something akin to day care until formal schooling began in primary school. He believed that young children should be educated, rather than merely babysat, and that they should be educated primarily through play and exploration—that the care-centers for young children should benefit not just the adults who had to go to work and needed someone to watch their kids, but the kids who were stuck in these centers. Education for Froebel was less about acquiring knowledge, and more about discovering the \"inner relationship of things,\" by which he meant the interrelationship between nature, the person, and the spiritual. ",
			"He opened his first kindergarten in 1837, and the curriculum had three aspects: playing with toys, so young children could become familiar with inanimate objects and how they work",
			"playing games and singing songs, so that young children could not only exercise their bodies, but be instilled with what Froebel considered to be \"spirit\" and \"humanity\"",
			"and gardening and caring for animals, so young children could learn empathy for plants and animals. His experimental \"children’s garden\" garnered much interest, and by the 1880s, kindergartens had been opened in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Hungary, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States. ",
			"The word itself came into English in 1852—the same year that Froebel died.",
			"Flak",
			"There are a number of German words that came into English during the two World Wars. Flak is one of them.",
			"Flak came into English in the 1930s and originally referred to anti-aircraft guns, and then later to anti-aircraft fire, and especially the bursting shells of anti-aircraft fire. That later sense gave rise to flak jacket, or a jacket designed to protect the wearer from injury from flak, shrapnel , or bullets. In the 1960s, flak gained a much broader use: it came to refer to any sudden criticism. It shows up in sentences that still mirror its military flavor, like \"The company took some flak from unhappy investors.\"",
			"Flak is a direct borrowing from German, where it was actually an acronym. In German, new words can be created simply by smooshing together existing words, and this can lead to some really unwieldy compounds. (Mark Twain wrote, \"Some German words are so long that they have a perspective\" in an appendix to A Tramp Abroad that was appropriately titled The Awful German Language). One such compound was the name for an anti-aircraft gun: Fliegerabwehrkanone. The word was a compound of the earlier Fliegerabwehr, which means \"defense against air attack,\" and Kanone, which means \"cannon.\" Fliegerabwehr itself is another compound made up of Flieger, \"aviator,\" and Abwehr, \"defense.\" While not terribly long by German standards, Fliegerabwehrkanone was awkward enough that when the guns were used in the field of war, the name was shortened to Flak, from Fliegerabwehrkanone.",
			"Flak has been so far removed from its German origins that it’s often confused with another word, flack. The latter is used to refer to a press agent or spin doctor",
			"it’s been so confused with flak that we now consider flack to be a lesser-used variant spelling of flak."

			"This post is part of Stress-Less Parenting Club's latest workshop. Our leader Carla Naumburg is showing us how we can make our family life calmer and happier through mindful parenting.",
			"I will never forget the first time I tried to meditate. I was sitting on a hard floor in a stinky gymnasium, hoping to score an easy PE credit so I could graduate from college. A tall, thin man dressed all in white with a long, wispy beard instructed us to cross our legs, close our eyes, breathe deeply and clear our minds.",
			"I was able to cross my legs, but it all went downhill from there.",
			"Clear my mind? What the hell did that mean? Every time I tried to clear my mind, I realized I was just thinking about clearing my mind, which clearly isn’t the same thing. I tried thinking about black. I visualized black. But then I thought about how black isn’t my favorite color; I prefer blue but I can’t decide between sapphire or turquoise... and the next thing I knew, my mind was anything but clear. Also, my butt hurt from sitting on a hard floor, my nose itched, and I wasn’t sure if I should scratch it.",
			"I didn’t try meditation again for almost 20 years.",
			"Fast forward to parenthood. You know my story: I was yelling too much and I wanted to find a way to stay calm through the chaos of tantrums and whining and kids not listening. I did not want to meditate. But I was desperate, and everything I read about how to be kinder and less reactive pointed to meditation. Against my better judgment (at the time), I signed up for a mindfulness-based stress reduction course.",
			"Here is what I learned about meditation:",
			"1. You don’t have to sit cross-legged on the floor to meditate. You can sit in a chair or on a meditation cushion or bench -- or you can lie down or walk. You can be comfortable.",
			"2. You don’t have to close your eyes.",
			"3. You don’t have to clear your mind. Far from it.",
			"4. Meditation isn’t about staying perfectly focused on your breath or a candle or a mantra. It’s about noticing when your mind has strayed and coming back, over and over again. Even seasoned meditators have a hard time staying focused.",
			"5. How you feel during your meditation session is not an indication of how successful or unsuccessful it was. How you feel after you meditate is much more important.",
			"I try to meditate for about 20 minutes at a time, several times a week. Please note, I said try. It doesn’t happen every day for me, and it certainly doesn’t have to happen every day for you. But meditation is dose dependent, meaning the more you do it, the more you will experience its benefits, such as decreased stress and reactivity (i.e. you’ll be less likely to explode at your kids), improved sleep and better moods.",
			"So, if you’re ready to give it a shot, here’s what you need to do:",
			"Sit down and breathe.",
			"Here’s how:",
			"Find a comfortable sitting position, either on a chair or on a cushion. If you’re in a chair, sit with both feet on the floor. You can also lie down, and if you find yourself falling asleep, enjoy the nap. Next time, try keeping your eyes open.",
			"Take a few deep breaths to start, and then let your breathing steady out to however your body wants to breathe. You don’t have to breathe slowly or deeply, just breathe normally. Pay attention to your breath, either at your nostrils or at your belly. You can say quietly \"in, out, in, out\" with each breath, or you can count your breaths, and when you get to 10, start again at one.",
			"When your mind wanders, as it will after about three seconds, just gently go back to your breathing. Try not to get frustrated with yourself; your mind is just doing what it is used to doing -- thinking! Just notice your thoughts, whatever they are, let them go, and go back to your breath. And then do it again, and again.",
			"If 20 minutes seems like a long time, try 10. Or two. Any amount of time is better than none. You can use a kitchen timer, a digital watch or any one of the apps listed below to help you.",
			"THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE 1. Keep going with the challenges from the previous weeks: try to notice when you’re physically but not mentally present with your children, and find times each day to practice mindfulness. 2. Try meditating! My favorite meditation apps for iPhone and Android are the Insight Timer, Buddhify and HeadSpace. There are a lot of options, so do a little exploring to find one you like."

			"Susan Olsen was just 7 years old when she joined the cast of \"The Brady Bunch\" as the youngest one in curls. In a new episode of \"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\" on OWN, Olsen talks about sibling rivalry on the show, the alleged hookups between her and co-star Mike Lookinland (Bobby Brady), and how much money the cast really makes on all of those \"Brady Bunch\" re-runs.",
			"\"It was very much like we really were siblings, except we didn't have to live together and share one bathroom,\" Olsen says in the above clip.",
			"When it comes to competition between cast mates, Olsen says there was somewhat of a real-life \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia\" situation. \"I would say that the only thing that even comes close to genuine sibling rivalry would be between Eve Plumb, who played Jan, and Maureen McCormick, who played Marcia,\" she says. \"We love them both. We just don't see the two of them together.\"",
			"Rumors have circulated for years about the cast mates' off-screen relationships, but Olsen can clear up her side. \"When it comes down to stories of all these alleged hookups, [Mike] Lookinland, who would be my partner, Bobby Brady, we used to kiss in the doghouse and we'd say we had 'makeout sessions' in the doghouse.\"",
			"But it was all innocent fun, Olsen says. \"We didn't know how to make out! We would just kiss each other and go, 'I love you, I love you,' and hug.\"",
			"Also in the video, Olsen explains why she left acting and the assumption that people always make about her income. \"People do tend to assume that we made a lot of money off 'The Brady Bunch' because it's on all the time,\" she says. \"So people just think that, oh, I must be rich. We all must be rich. And nothing could be further from the truth.\"",
			"Olsen says it's not because she signed a bad contract, it was just the way syndication worked back then. \"People only got paid for re-runs for the first 10 runs,\" she explains. \"The first 10 runs happened and were over with, probably by 1979. And so we've made no money since then.\""

			"Can Paedophilia Really Be Cured With Drugs?"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Facebook",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"According to the Daily Mail, scientists in Sweden are working on a \"cure\" for paedophilia. The trial involves a drug that disrupts testosterone.",
			"Forcing or persuading children to have sex is one of the worst things a person can do to them. Sexual abuse causes serious emotional and physical harm, and can ruin a child’s capacity to have healthy relationships as an adult. However, we mustn’t confuse all sexual abuse of children with paedophilia.",
			"Paedophiles are sexually attracted to children but they may, or may not, act on their urges. In fact, my experience indicates that most of the people who abuse children are not paedophiles. Research by Alanko and colleagues, looking at the question of whether paedophilia was inherited, showed that approximately 5% of men in the study with paedophilia had offended against children. In fact, people who offend against children, in my experience, are (mostly) men who are obsessed with sex and are looking for a sexual outlet, regardless of the age of the victim.",
			"In our research which looked at whether medication was helpful for sexual offenders who struggled with their obsession with sex, we found that while over 90% of them had committed offences against children, most of them had also abused adults. And, in some cases, victims included both males and females, showing a broad pattern of offending. These abusers will seek out any possible opportunity for sexual satisfaction and sadly children are often vulnerable and easy prey.",
			"Clinicians use the following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria to diagnose paedophilia:",
			"Over a period of at least six months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviours involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger). The person has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The person is at least age 16 years and at least five years older than the child or children in Criterion A.",
			"Most paedophiles don’t act on their urges",
			"Many researchers think that paedophilia is a sexual orientation (like heterosexuality), rather than a psychosexual disorder or illness. Regardless of which it is, it’s very difficult for people to live with. Discovering at puberty that your sexual preference is for children, is usually a terrifying and depressing realisation.",
			"Think back to when you were 13 or 14 years old and just beginning to become strangely drawn to the boys or girls around you. Now think what it would have been like if those feelings were not for your own peer group, but for much younger children. You might wonder or worry a bit at first, and, as time went on, worry a lot. Why are you so different? What is wrong with you? Who can you talk to about it?",
			"It’s tough enough for teenagers to talk to their parents about sex, let alone tell them they are a paedophile. What we need to do, as a society, is to understand that some people are sexually attracted to children. More than this, we also need to understand that this attraction to children does not bring with it an uncontrollable urge to force sexual attention on children.",
			"Or course, there will be a small number of people who either can’t or won’t control their sexual urges, but for the most part, they can and they will. Think of yourself in a similar situation with your preferred partner type. How easy do you find it to control yourself in a roomful of the type of people you are attracted to? It’s not so difficult to do, is it?",
			"Medication to manage sexual arousal",
			"But what about paedophiles who do act on their urges (as well as sex offenders who prey on children) – do the drugs work for them? As the researcher leading the evaluation of the use of these types of drugs in the UK prison service, I can reassure you that they do reduce people’s obsession with sex.",
			"The drugs seem to work well and it is great that they are being offered (in this case) as a prevention tool. It’s also important that they are offered alongside psychological treatment to further help people control their urges.",
			"As of April 1, 2016, both medication and psychological treatment are also being offered in the UK across the whole of the prison service, and some charities, such as the Safer Living Foundation, are also looking to offer them as a prevention tool for people who have not yet committed an offence.",
			"Keeping children safe",
			"Although testosterone disrupting drugs can help sex offenders control their urges, they may not be a cure for paedophilia. As already described, most people who offend against children are not paedophiles.",
			"Most paedophiles are perfectly capable of controlling themselves and understand the damage that will be done to children by sexual abuse. We need to stop panicking about paedophiles, and focus our efforts on offering treatment and help to anyone struggling with their sexual urges. That’s what will help our children grow up safely.",

Now, a promotional email from the company has ripped the lid off Valve’s plans for 2016.",
			"This year’s Steam summer sale will get underway on June 23, as per an email distributed to PayPal account holders over the past week. \"Now you know when it’s going to happen,\" reads the accompanying message \"you can get ready for the savings.\"",
			"While in previous years PayPal has let the cat out of the bag without Valve’s say-so, it seems that the company was given the go-ahead this time around. The email makes reference to the exclusive nature of the reveal, and a tweet promoting the announcement tagged the official Steam account, according to a report from Tech Spot.",
			"This news seems to confirm previous reports that the 2016 summer sale would run from June 23 to July 4. In May, a developer using the handle MrFreemanBBQ posted a screenshot of communication from Valve referencing those dates — along with a message warning recipients to keep this \"confidential\" information secret — to the Steam subreddit.",
			"Digital downloads have long been at the core of the Steam platform and its summer sales, but this year we might see Valve push its hardware with some deep discounts. Recent sales figures for the Steam Controller suggest that both the peripheral and the company’s Steam Machines are struggling to find an audience.",
			"However, the summer sale isn’t just about price cuts — Valve often adds an extra element to draw consumers in, like the monster game that was rolled out in support of last year’s iteration. We’ll find out what the company has planned for 2016 when the sale gets underway on June 23."

			"By Justice Schanfarber",
			"As a marriage counselor working with men and women in relationship crisis, I help clients navigate numerous issues. While many situations are complex, there's one profoundly simple truth that men need to know: Women leave men they love.",
			"They feel terrible about it. It tears their heart out. But they do it. They rally their courage and their resources and they leave. Women leave men with whom they have children, homes and lives.",
			"Women leave for many reasons, but there's one reason in particular that haunts me, one that I want men to understand: Women leave because their man is not present.",
			"He's working, golfing, gaming, watching TV, fishing ... the list is long. These aren't bad men. They're good men. They're good fathers. They support their family. They're nice, likeable. But they take their wife for granted. They're not present.",
			"Women in my office tell me, \"Someone could come and sweep me off my feet, right out from under my husband.\" Sometimes the realization scares them. Sometimes it makes them cry.",
			"Men, I'm not saying this is right or wrong. I'm telling you what I see. You can get as angry, hurt or indignant as you want. Your wife is not your property. She does not owe you her soul. You earn it. Day by day, moment after moment.",
			"You win her over first and foremost with your presence, your aliveness. She needs to feel it. She wants to talk to you about what matters to her and to feel that you're listening to her. Not nodding politely. Not placating. Definitely not playing devil's advocate.",
			"She wants you to feel her. She doesn't want absent-minded groping or quick sex. She wants to feel your passion. Can you feel your passion? Can you show her? Not just your passion for her or for sex; your passion for being alive. Do you have it? It's the most attractive thing you possess. If you've lost it, what's the reason? Where did it go? Find out. Find it. If you never discovered it, you are living on borrowed time.",
			"If you think you're present with your wife, try listening to her. Does your mind wander? Notice. When you look at her, how deeply do you see her? Look again, look deeper.",
			"Meet her gaze and keep it for longer than usual, longer than what's comfortable. If she asks what you're doing, tell her, \"I'm looking into you. I want to see you deeply. I'm curious about who you are. After all these years I still want to know who you are, every day.\" But only say it if you mean it, if you know it's true.",
			"Touch her with your full attention. Before you put your hand on her, notice the sensation in your hand. Notice what happens the moment you make contact. What happens in your body? What do you feel? Notice the most subtle sensations and emotions. (This is sometimes described as mindfulness.) Tell her everything you're noticing, moment after moment.",
			"But you're busy. You don't have time for all this. How about five minutes? Five minutes a day. Will you commit to that? I'm not talking about extravagant dinners or date nights (although these are fine, too). I'm talking about five minutes a day to be completely present with the woman you share your life with.",
			"To be completely open -- listening and seeing without judgment. Will you do that? I bet once you start, once you get a taste, you won't want to stop.",
			"(Note: The gender dynamic outlined above is reversible. It can go both ways.)",

			"Karen Bleier / AFP / Getty Images ID: 9231242",
			"Have you experienced crazy-long lines at Starbucks lately? If so, some of the company’s staff say there’s a reason for the longer waits: the coffee chain has been cutting back on worker hours, leading to declining service in stores.",
			"As a money-making business, Starbucks has been on a roll lately — the coffee chain reported another quarter of record sales and profit last week. So it baffled many of the company’s hourly employees in the U.S. when, as business boomed this spring, they noticed a dramatic change: they weren’t getting enough hours of work.",
			"Eight Starbucks employees from several cities around the country told BuzzFeed News that since May, the number of work hours assigned to stores by the chain’s Global Labor Scheduling (GLS) system has fallen far below both what they need and what they normally receive. The change came with no warning or explanation from executives; some staff say their schedules were cut in advance, while others have been sent home during their shifts. Many have taken to social media to complain, with some threatening to quit.",
			"ID: 9323172",
			"If you have information or tips, you can contact this reporter via email at venessa.wong@buzzfeed.com",
			"ID: 9323177",
			"It’s an unexpected turn for the Seattle coffee chain, which has long considered itself an employer of choice in a fast food industry infamous for bare-minimum pay and benefits, and demoralized workers. An internal communication portal used by the company has received numerous complaints from staff — \"partners,\" in Starbucks lingo — about reduced hours and declining morale, according to screenshots provided to BuzzFeed News.",
			"BuzzFeed News source ID: 9321991",
			"Starbucks told BuzzFeed News there has been no change in labor strategy and managers are being asked to handle staffing as needed on a store-by-store basis. \"We are not trying to reduce labor. We want our stores staffed in accordance with what they each need,\" said spokesperson Jaime Riley.",
			"Yet an internal company email reviewed by BuzzFeed News, which was sent to field leaders in May, suggests the company is closely watching labor expenses across the chain as growth slows. It said the weeks in May and June following Starbucks’ Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion are \"historically challenging weeks to forecast and schedule as the business experiences a significant decrease in transactions, resulting in an overspend in labor.\" The email asks field leaders to help control this overspending using a new \"forecasting tool\" that would \"adjust forecasts and compensate for downward trend in business.\"",
			"\"‘Reducing overspending’ seems like good business sense,\" Riley, the Starbucks spokesperson, said in response to the email.",
			"Starbucks staff told BuzzFeed News that store managers use the company’s GLS software to determine how many worker hours they can allocate. The managers input how many transactions they think their location will ring up for a given week, and the system generates an allocation of total labor hours, using an algorithm that also takes into account historical sales.",
			"The store manager then assigns those hours to individual workers. But in recent months, staff say that managers noticed their estimates were returning fewer hours. Just by way of illustration, if an estimated 800 transactions usually earned a store 70 hours of labor, the store might now receive only 65 hours for the same estimate.",
			"\"Someone seemingly flipped a switch on the labor model,\" one manager who has worked for Starbucks for nearly a decade told BuzzFeed News. \"The whole month of July has been the tightest in scheduling I’ve ever experienced,\" said another longtime manager.",
			"Starbucks sales, despite reaching new highs, have fallen short of expectations for the last nine months. The chain experienced a slowdown in U.S. sales growth from April to June — sales at cafes open at least 13 months increased by 4% compared to 8% during the same period last year. The company has called its recent performance an anomaly and expects its domestic business to pick up again.",
			"\"With costs of raw coffee going up and minimum wage rising, they will be looking for cost efficiencies anyplace they can find them,\" said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones.",
			"I noticed a change in service myself back in June, as did other Starbucks customers.",
			"@Starbucks the customer service at my local shop is getting pretty disappointing. What's going on? :( — Jessica O (@StrawbryDevl) ID: 9291343",
			"25min to get a latte at @Starbucks today was a new low in customer service. Time for a change? — Jack Cartwright (@jcxray48) ID: 9291319",
			"Starbucks’ recent labor situation was the subject of an online worker petition started in June. Cutting back on hours \"creates an atmosphere where baristas are worn to the bone without being able to take a breath. Cleanliness suffers, speed of service suffers, partners suffer.....the labor climate keeps most baristas regularly underemployed, enough to qualify for benefits, but not enough to afford to pay for them,\" it read. The petition has attracted 13,500 signatures so far.",
			"Despite the attention garnered by the petition, Starbucks says it has been tracking complaints from its employees and only 3% have been related to staffing and scheduling in recent weeks. Riley, the company spokesperson, said the chain has received \"overwhelmingly positive\" feedback about a U.S. pay raise announced this month, which moves a scheduled pay bump forward from next January to this October.",
			"On Monday, Starbucks confirmed to BuzzFeed News that it will also pay a $500 bonus to employees who have been with the company for at least two years. When it comes to the perceived cutback in hours, \"we encourage partners to work with managers on staffing scheduling needs,\" Riley said.",
			"A number of Starbucks workers — many who said they used to love their jobs — have shared their stories online about the effect of reductions in hours. Here are some condensed excerpts.",
			"\"Cutting labor is all-consuming.\"",
			"\"Because our store manager is contacted constantly about hours, we are asked to send labor updates at 12p, 4p, and 8p every day. But even if we end up 100+ transactions over forecast and have already cut hours, we’re told we should have cut more. My store continually meets and exceeds the confusing, sometimes nearly impossible goals set forth by a computer system and people who are 1,000 miles away.\" - Leslie",
			"\"Labor cuts are definitely taking a toll on us.\"",
			"\"Although my schedules say 20 hours, since labor is being cut I can never hit the 20 hour mark. That means I don’t qualify for benefits. My husband’s 40 hours a week [at Starbucks] have turned into 29 hours a week. It’s hard. It’s hard to think about the next schedules being put up, and dreading looking at he number of hours we are getting. Trying to calculate how much money we need to make just to get the kids fed, keep the lights on, and gas in the car. No one wants to give up hours, which means picking up shifts is getting harder and harder because everyone is scrounging for hours..I’ve never seen such an aggression about labor before. Over five years, and I’ve never had to truly worry about my hours, they stayed consistent..with the occasional ‘You wanna go home early today?’ But now it’s ‘You have to go home, we are way over on labor.’ ... In the past six months, I have heard more about numbers and labor than I have in the five years I’ve been with Starbucks.\" - Caylee",
			"\"It didn’t feel like work at all at first. All of that changed a few months ago.\"",
			"\"I noticed we seemed to be short staffed more often and it always felt like we were all flustered or moving at a dizzying pace. I also became a shift supervisor about a month ago. Advancing in my position is a huge change as it is. Add in even less people to work with but having the same volume of customers, and I am so physically and emotionally exhausted that my job is not even fun for me anymore. Want to know the last time I had a lunch break during one of my eight hour shifts? I couldn’t even tell you since it has been so long ago. In fact, today I worked a nine hour shift on the floor with just one five-minute break, long enough to take a few sips of my iced vanilla chai and eat a doughnut.\" - Stephannie",
			"\"My hours have gone from 26 to 29 hours a week to 20 to18 hours a week.\"",
			"\"With only two people on the floor at a cafe, we can barely keep up, as the lobby is neglected and bathrooms and customers are complaining. I plan to hang in there but a lot of partners have no choice but look for other employment.\" - Vickie",
			"\"I recently had a baby, and was on an extended maternity leave due to complications. When I returned to work, hours were getting cut too much.\"",
			"\"Short night shifts, cut down to two hours because of being sent home early, were too much. We were closing the highest volume store in the city with only three employees in the tourist area of town. It was a constant battle of being sent home early, or scrambling all night, unable to get everything done. Driving 30 minutes to work wasn’t worth it, especially for the poor pay as a barista with a newborn at home.\" - Bailey",
			"\"I like working hard. I like being busy.\"",
			"\"However, the reality is that if I spend my morning on the floor with six or seven people who are killing themselves to fill customer orders that really call for eight or nine baristas (mostly because [Global Labor Scheduling] doesn’t adequately account for things like multi-part orders or food [orders]), I’m exhausted by the time I get home. Beyond that, being overworked and understaffed hurts partner morale. It makes it so that stores not as clean and pleasant as they should be, and customers are not taken care of in the way that they deserve to be.\" - Noel",
			"\"Every transaction is rushed through as the line continues to grow!\"",
			"\"Orders are put on the bar where our solo barista makes every single beverage as fast as possible while trying to focus on what they are doing whilst grabbing all those stickers from cafe, drive-thru, and [mobile order and pay]. The drive thru times are suffering horribly; our average ticket is six to eight drinks each car! It looks bad on the company from a guests perspective to have three or four partners on the floor when the place is absolute chaos.\" - Samantha",
			"\"I came into this company in January and I loved my first few months.\"",
			"\"But you can see it in our faces and demeanors how much it’s taking its toll. And now I received a paycheck for not even $200 that is nowhere near enough to pay my rent and bills. This so for two weeks work!!! Our store has failed two [Quality Assurance Standards Assessment] audits in the month because it never stays clean enough because we never have enough people to maintain the store. We never have schedules ready until a few days before the next week starts. Deliveries are made and stay there for days because on two man sets who’s going to put it away. We’re just exhausted, disappointed and now angry that all of our hard work is being taken for granted. I can’t survive on this dismal pay and only 15 to 20 weekly tips. I’m going to have to cut off my medical insurance and stop 401k just so I can make ends meet! I love my job but I can’t survive in this atmosphere!\" - Andre",

			"Light-up shoes are a popular trend that has had a steady following for several years. Almost every child has owned a pair of these shoes and business isn’t slowing down. They’re an automatic hit with children who love to stomp around the house incessantly as they show off the stellar light performance in their shoes. Have you ever stopped to wonder what powers the light? Two parents were stunned by the destruction they suspect was caused by their son’s shoes.",
			"A couple in Katy, Texas noticed an odd haze building up in their vehicle. When Jovan and Attila Virag opened the back of their SUV, they smelled the familiar scent of burnt plastic and noticed that there was a hole burned into the floor and the back of their passenger seat was melted. They sifted through the contents in their backseat, but there was nothing that could have started a fire except for their 2-year-old son’s light-up shoes.",
			"When Attila took apart one of the charred shoes, she noticed that the lights were powered by lithium batteries. The father hadn’t the slightest idea that there were batteries in the shoes that could short and we suspect he isn’t alone. Understanding the mechanics of a pair of shoes isn’t high on most people’s priority list.",
			"The fire marshal was called in to investigate what may have caused sparks to ignite in the vehicle. A decision about the origin of the fire hasn’t been determined yet, but the shoes are being considered a possibility. The Virags are desperate to share this information with other parents. They were lucky that their son wasn’t wearing the shoes when the fire started. Otherwise, the consequences could have been way more severe.",
			"Although light-up shoes may be high up on your child’s wish list, it might be safer to err on the side of caution or at least do your research before purchasing the shoes."

		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Famed poet and author Maya Angelou passed away this week at age 86, leaving her life, politics and worldviews to be dissected in obituaries and eulogies around the Internet. Among one of Angelou's notable policy stances was her opposition to standardized testing and President Barack Obama's Race to the Top competition, as the Washington Post pointed out this week.",
			"We are alarmed at the negative impact of excessive school testing mandates, including your Administration’s own initiatives, on children’s love of reading and literature. Recent policy changes by your Administration have not lowered the stakes. On the contrary, requirements to evaluate teachers based on student test scores impose more standardized exams and crowd out exploration.",
			"Angelou was among 120 authors and illustrators who co-signed a letter to Obama in October 2013, criticizing his administration's education initiatives for placing too much emphasis on standardized testing. In the letter, organized by The National Center for Fair and Open Testing, the authors wrote",
			"Launched in 2009, the Race to the Top competition allows districts and states to compete for federal funding in exchange for implementing certain education initiatives, such as adopting higher standards or building new teacher evaluation systems.",
			"As the Washington Post notes, Angelou further spoke out against the initiative on MSNBC's \"Andrea Mitchell Reports.\" \"Race To The Top feels to be more like a contest,\" Angelou said, \"... not what did you learn, but how much can you memorize.\"",
			"As CBS points out, Angelou and Obama had a somewhat up-and-down relationship. Angelou supported Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic primary, although Obama awarded Angelou the Presidential Medal of Freedom in February 2011. However, in 2009, Angelou told Newsweek that Obama's election was an \"indication that [America] may at last be growing up, growing beyond racism, sexism, ageism and all those other ignorances. This is why we see faces radiating with hope.\"",
			"\"Like so many others, Michelle and I will always cherish the time we were privileged to spend with Maya. With a kind word and a strong embrace, she had the ability to remind us that we are all God's children; that we all have something to offer. And while Maya's day may be done, we take comfort in knowing that her song will continue, 'flung up to heaven' – and we celebrate the dawn that Maya Angelou helped bring.\""

			"Most hikers would hightail it upon spotting two snakes fighting on a path. Arkansas hiker Dawn Kelly decided to record the snakes on her smartphone instead, creating the kind of video most of us would rather watch from a safe distance.",
			"The unusual thing about this snake battle royale, however, isn't that Kelly managed to record it unscathed, but that the two snakes, a copperhead and a cottonmouth, shouldn't have been fighting at all.",
			"According to Alabama Auburn University herpetologist David Steen, male snakes often fight in something called a \"combat dance\" over female snakes. But until now, no one has recorded evidence of two different species of male snakes fighting, according to the BBC.",
			"When snakes wrestle, it's not to the death but to overpower the weaker snake and eventually mate with the female snake waiting for the winner nearby. But if the female snake is of a different species, this sort of a sparring match seems like a wasted effort since snakes can only mate with their own kind.",
			"The video shows the two male snakes battling, and there's no female snake or snakes captured in the footage. So it's ultimately unclear whether the male snakes were indeed fighting to impress female snakes off camera.",
			"Another herpetologist, Professor Phil Senter of Fayetteville State University in North Carolina, told the BBC the tangle could have been about territory and not a mating ritual at all. \"It could have just been a border dispute,\" Senter said.",
			"One thing both herpetologists can agree on: two different snake species fighting is extremely rare. \"I've never seen that before, two different species fighting each other as if they're the same species,\" Senter said.",
			"One possible explanation is that thanks to reptile breeders who have been known to artificially hybridize these two snake species into \"cottonheads\" or \"coppermouths,\" this might also happen without human intervention in the wild.",
			"It could also be a case of mistaken identity, especially since copperheads and cottonmouths are members of the same animal genus, Agkistrodon. \"Snakes are dumb,\" Senter said. \"Their brains are very, very small. At least, the thinking part of it is.\"",
			"Either way, the video is an interesting view of male snake combat dance maneuvers."

		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"There’s an effort afoot to change the the way people perceive high-tech versions of old-fashioned food—and it’s happening far outside the laboratory.",
			"For years, food technology companies have referred to their products as \"cultured\" or \"lab-grown,\" but as these new businesses start to make a first foray into the public eye, they are also pushing ideas that may make people uncomfortable—such as meat grown in labs.",
			"To get over that, there’s a push to coalesce around a new term: \"clean food.\"",
			"\"It’s important because words matter in how we describe how something makes a big difference,\" said Paul Shapiro, a top leader at Humane Society of the United States and author of a forthcoming book on the subject. \"You can only make a first impression once.\"",
			"By opting for this terminology, the industry hopes to better communicate to people the ethos behind their products, rather than the actual processes (which often do occur in a laboratory) used to deliver them to the kitchen table. It’s main selling point: \"clean\" meat and dairy are efficient products with fewer sustainability and animal-welfare problems than traditional meat and dairy.",
			"The effort—piggybacking off the now-ubiquitous use of the term \"clean energy\"—is being spearheaded by the Good Food Institute, the newly-established, non-profit trade group in Washington, DC. To better make its case, the Good Food Institute is preparing to highlight research by Brian Wansink, a formed US Department of Agriculture official who studied ways to get kids in US schools to eat more vegetables:",
			"Research suggests the biggest influence on a person’s opinion of a particular food is how they \"expect\" it will taste. Giving fun, enticing names to healthy foods increases the desire to try them. Why not call broccoli \"broccoli bites\" or carrots \"X-ray vision carrots?\" Renaming foods to make them sound more appealing resulted in an increase in the sale of vegetables in the school cafeteria by 27%.",
			"The move comes as these high-tech foods are starting to appear before consumers. Impossible Foods unveiled its plant-based burger at Momofuku Nishi in New York City in late-July, and Beyond Meat is selling its version of a similar product in a limited number of US supermarkets. Memphis Meats is perfecting its product and Perfect Day, the vegan milk company, is looking to launch its first yogurt product in 2017.",
			"These are some of the first players in what some hope will be a \"clean food\" revolution."

			"Hillary Clinton’s ongoing campaign to paint Donald Trump as unacceptable in the eyes of most Americans is working. It’s just not good enough. That’s the message of the spate of recent polls showing a dramatically tightened race that Trump may even be narrowly winning.",
			"The truth is that Trump is not doing well. Even Trump’s very best recent polls (which, by definition, are outliers that likely overstate his true level of support) show him receiving fewer votes than Republican candidates usually get. A recent CNN poll of Ohio , for example, that gave him a 5-point lead in the crucial swing state also shows him only getting 46 percent of the vote. Mitt Romney and John McCain both did better than that. Clinton’s attacks and Trump’s well-known weaknesses seem to have him losing the support of some GOP loyalists, even in his best polls.",
			"The problem is that Clinton herself is doing worse. Because despite her campaign’s emphasis on Trump’s weirdness and unpopularity, that isn’t the only force shaping this race. It’s profoundly unusual across two other dimensions — the strength of third party candidates and the weakness of the frontrunner — that will probably prevent Clinton from ever opening up a sustained comfortable lead unless she can do something to make herself better-liked.",
			"Clinton is a freakishly unpopular frontrunner",
			"Despite a couple of days’ worth of bad polls, Clinton still leads in national polling averages. It remains the case that if the election were held tomorrow, she would win.",
			"It is totally unheard of to win a presidential election while having deeply underwater favorable ratings, and it is actually quite common to lose one despite above water favorable ratings.",
			"Since there are only two major party nominees in the race and they are both far underwater right now, it’s pretty likely that precedent will be shattered. But we are in a bit of an undiscovered country in terms of the underlying opinion dynamics.",
			"Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are doing remarkably well",
			"If those numbers hold up (which of course they might not), they would make Johnson the strongest third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992. That’s a big deal. Stein’s strength is, however, even more unusual. She is polling ahead of where Ralph Nader did in 2000 and is the strongest fourth-party candidate we’ve seen in a 100 years, besting both the Thurmond and Wallace tickets from the infamously four-sided election of 1948.",
			"To find a fourth-place candidate polling higher than Stein’s current results, you need to dial all the way back to the 6 percent of the vote Eugene Debs earned in the bizarre 1912 election that saw the GOP nominee (the incumbent, no less!) finish in third place behind a third-party bid spearheaded by ex-president Teddy Roosevelt.",
			"For a stable lead, Clinton needs to be liked",
			"These two unusual quirks of the 2016 race seem to be linked.",
			"Lambasting Trump while being unpopular herself would be a clear winning strategy in a zero-sum head-to-head race. But in a four-sided race, where the two lesser candidates aren’t receiving much scrutiny from the press or the campaigns, it tends to have the side consequence of pressing a lot of people to Johnson or Stein. The fact that there are two different third-party candidates in the race — one for people who think Clinton’s too left and one for people who think she’s not left enough — makes it really difficult to avoid bleeding voters.",
			"If polls stay very tight or Trump pulls into a lead, then anti-Trump messaging to Johnson and Stein voters could take the form of classic warnings about spoilers and wasted votes.",
			"But the fact that Clinton has been consistently leading in the polls — and in August was doing so by a large margin — has itself undercut purely tactical arguments for voting Clinton. If she is overwhelmingly likely to win, which is what people have been hearing, then you may as well not vote for her if you don’t like her.",
			"It’s simply going to be very hard for Clinton to open up the kind of stable lead that her supporters think Trump’s awfulness deserves while she herself is so little-liked. September of a general election year is probably not a great time to turn that around.",
			"But the fact remains that her basic problem in this race is almost painfully simple. Over the course of her winning primary campaign she became a deeply unpopular figure. And it’s hard — indeed, unprecedented — for such an unpopular person to win the presidency.",
			"The bad map we see every presidential election"

			"A big-budget film arriving in U.S. theaters this weekend has been absolutely savaged by movie critics but still has a ray of hope after setting box-office records overseas in one of the world's biggest movie markets.",
			"The reviews have been scathing for Warcraft , the video-game adaptation from Legendary Entertainment and Universal Pictures that cost a reported $160 million to make. But, Warcraft has already managed to pull in more than $120 million internationally, according to Box Office Mojo, even amid incredibly low expectations for the movie's domestic release on Friday.",
			"Warcraft made a respectable $75 million in its first few weeks of a limited international release before opening in China on Wednesday (with midnight screenings starting Tuesday night) to record-setting box-office sales in the country that is expected to surpass the U.S. as the world's largest movie market sometime next year. The movie surged to a $46 million Chinese opening on Wednesday, setting a first-day box office record for a non-weekend release in the country while also breaking a record set last year by Furious 7 for its opening day sales in IMAX theaters, with $5.3 million, Deadline reports .",
			"Those blockbuster numbers come despite the fact that critics have lambasted the movie, with various reviews describing it as anywhere from \"rather tacky\" to \"unwatchable\" , to the tune of just a 23% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes .",
			"Variety notes that Warcraft 's stellar start in China could pave the way for the movie to make as much as $150 million in that country, where the game the movie is based on—Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft —is especially popular , boasting a large chunk of the game's millions of fans. That would be a huge boost to the studios behind Warcraft , which many of those same analysts are predicting will only make around $25 million in the U.S. this weekend.",
			"Comcast's ( cmcsa ) Universal is distributing Warcraft in most countries, but Legendary Entertainment is partnering with a group of Chinese distributors in that country. Earlier this year, Legendary was sold for $3.5 billion to China's Dalian Wanda, which is expanding its presence in the global movie market and is also the world's largest cinema chain operator.",

			"12 Ways To Never Get Diabetes (Type 2)"
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"These simple steps may be all it takes to stay healty",
			"Nearly 25% of Americans are thought to have prediabetes—a condition of slightly elevated blood sugar levels that often develops into diabetes within 10 years—but only 4% of people know it. What’s worse, of those who are aware, less than half really tried to reduce their risk by losing weight, eating less, and exercising more. These are just a few of the good-for-you habits that can reverse prediabetes and ensure you never get the real thing, which can mean a lifetime of drugs and blood sugar monitoring, an increased risk of heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and other scary health threats. Read on for 12 healthy lifestyle habits everyone can start today.",
			"1. Nudge the scale",
			"Shedding even 10 pounds can significantly slash your risk. Even extremely overweight people were 70% less likely to develop diabetes when they lost just 5% of their weight—even if they didn’t exercise. If you weigh 175 pounds, that’s a little less than 9 pounds! Use our calorie calculator to see how many calories you consume—and how many you need to shave off your diet—if you want to lose a little.",
			"2. Pick the right appetizer",
			"May we recommend the salad? Eating greens with a vinaigrette before a starchy entrée may help control your blood sugar levels. In an Arizona State University study, people with type 2 diabetes or a precursor condition called insulin resistance had lower blood sugar levels if they consumed about 2 tablespoons of vinegar just before a high-carb meal. \"Vinegar contains acetic acid, which may inactivate certain starch-digesting enzymes, slowing carbohydrate digestion,\" says lead researcher Carol Johnston, PhD. In fact, vinegar’s effects may be similar to those of the blood sugar—lowering medication acarbose (Precose).",
			"Before you eat that fettuccine, enjoy a salad with this dressing: Whisk 3 tablespoons vinegar, 2 tablespoons flaxseed oil, 1 clove garlic (crushed), 1/4 teaspoon honey, 3 tablespoons yogurt, and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. (Makes four 2-tablespoon servings.)",
			"3. Ditch your car",
			"Walk as much as you can every day. You’ll be healthier—even if you don’t lose any weight. People in a Finnish study who exercised the most—up to 4 hours a week, or about 35 minutes a day—dropped their risk of diabetes by 80%, even if they didn’t lose any weight. This pattern holds up in study after study: The famed Nurses’ Health Study, for example, found that women who worked up a sweat more than once a week reduced their risk of developing diabetes by 30%. And Chinese researchers determined that people with high blood sugar who engaged in moderate exercise (and made other lifestyle changes) were 40% less likely to develop full-blown diabetes. Why is walking so wonderful? Studies show that exercise helps your body utilize the hormone insulin more efficiently by increasing the number of insulin receptors on your cells. Insulin helps blood sugar move into cells, where it needs to go to provide energy and nutrition. Otherwise it just sloshes around in your bloodstream, gumming up blood vessel walls and eventually causing serious health problems.",
			"4. Be a cereal connoisseur",
			"Selecting the right cereal can help you slim down and steady blood sugar. A higher whole grain intake is also linked to lower rates of breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and stroke—and cereal is one of the best sources of these lifesaving grains, if you know what to shop for.",
			"Some tips: Look for the words high fiber on the box",
			"that ensures at least 5 g per serving. But don’t stop there. Check the label",
			"in some brands, the benefits of fiber are overshadowed by the addition of refined grains, added sugar, or cholesterol-raising fats.",
			"Decode the grains: Where that fiber comes from matters too, so check the ingredient list to find out exactly what those flakes or squares are made from. Millet, amaranth, quinoa, and oats are always whole grain, but if you don’t see whole in front of wheat, corn, barley, or rice, these grains have been refined and aren’t as healthy.",
			"Watch for hidden sugar: The \"total sugars\" listing doesn’t distinguish between added and naturally occurring sugars",
			"the best way to tell is scan the ingredients again. The following terms represent added sugars: brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, high fructose corn syrup, invert sugar, maltose, malt syrup, molasses, sugar, and sucrose. Skip cereals that list any of these within the first three ingredients (which are listed by weight).",
			"5. Indulge coffee cravings",
			"If you’re a coffee fan, keep on sipping. The beverage may keep diabetes at bay. After they studied 126,210 women and men, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found that big-time coffee drinkers—those who downed more than 6 daily cups—had a 29 to 54% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes during the 18-year study. Sipping 4 to 5 cups cut risk about 29%",
			"1 to 3 cups per day had little effect. Decaf coffee offered no protection. Caffeine in other forms—tea, soda, chocolate—did. Researchers suspect that caffeine may help by boosting metabolism. And coffee, the major caffeine source in the study, also contains potassium, magnesium, and antioxidants that help cells absorb sugar. But before you become a VIP at Dunkin Donuts, remember that a medium chain-store cuppa is about 14 to 16 ounces—right there, that’s 2 \"cups\" by standard measures.",
			"6. Ditch the drive-thru",
			"You might get away with an occasional fast-food splurge, but become a regular \"fast feeder\" and your risk of diabetes skyrockets. That’s what University of Minnesota scientists found after they studied 3,000 people, ages 18 to 30, for 15 years. At the start, everyone was at a normal weight. But those who ate fast food more than twice a week gained 10 more pounds and developed twice the rate of insulin resistance—the two major risk factors for type 2 diabetes—compared with those who indulged less than once a week. In addition to the jumbo portions, many fast food meals are loaded with unhealthy trans fats and refined carbohydrates, which may raise diabetes risk even if your weight remains stable. A better bet: Keep a baggie of DIY trail mix in your purse at all times in case hunger pangs come on. Nuts are known blood sugar-lowerers.",
			"7. Go veggie more often",
			"Consider red meat a treat—not something to eat every day. Women who ate red meat at least 5 times a week had a 29% higher risk of type 2 diabetes than those who ate it less than once a week, found a 37,000-woman study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. And eating processed meats such as bacon and hot dogs at least 5 times a week raised type 2 diabetes risk by 43%, compared with eating them less than once a week. The culprits? Scientists suspect the cholesterol in red meat and the additives in processed meat are to blame. Try these two delicious dishes for a filling, meat-free entree: Stuffed Peppers Provence-Style Pasta Primavera",
			"8. Spice up your life",
			"Cinnamon may help rein in high blood sugar. German researchers studied 65 adults with type 2 diabetes who then took a capsule containing the equivalent of 1 g of cinnamon powder or a placebo 3 times a day for 4 months. By the end, cinnamon reduced blood sugar by about 10%",
			"the placebo users improved by only 4%. Why? Compounds in cinnamon may activate enzymes that stimulate insulin receptors. The sweet spice has also been shown to help lower cholesterol and triglycerides, blood fats that may contribute to diabetes risk.",
			"9. Unwind every day",
			"Chronic stress can send blood sugar levels soaring. When you’re stressed, your body is primed to take action. This gearing up causes your heart to beat faster, your breath to quicken, and your stomach to knot. But it also triggers your blood sugar levels to skyrocket. \"Under stress, your body goes into fight-or-flight mode, raising blood sugar levels to prepare you for action,\" says Richard Surwit, PhD, author of The Mind-Body Diabetes Revolutionand chief of medical psychology at Duke University. If your cells are insulin resistant, the sugar builds up in your blood, with nowhere to go—leading to chronically high levels. The good news is, simple relaxation exercises and other stress management moves can help you gain control over blood sugar levels, according to a study conducted at Duke University. Try these proven relaxers:",
			"Start your day with yoga, meditation, or a walk.",
			"Take three deep, slow breaths before answering the phone, starting the car, serving the kids lunch, or any other activity.",
			"Reclaim your Sundays as a day of rest or fun with your family, relaxing, worship, etc. Try to avoid spending the whole day on obligatory errands such as mowing the lawn, grocery shopping, or catching up on work.",
			"10. Get a perfect night’s rest",
			"There’s a sleep sweet spot when it comes to preventing diabetes. A Yale University study of 1,709 men found that those who regularly got less than 6 hours of shut-eye doubled their diabetes risk",
			"those who slept more than 8 hours tripled their odds. Previous studies have turned up similar findings in women. \"When you sleep too little—or too long because of sleep apnea—your nervous system stays on alert,\" says lead researcher Klar Yaggi, MD, an assistant professor of pulmonary medicine at Yale. This interferes with hormones that regulate blood sugar. A Columbia University study found that sleeping less than 5 hours also doubled the risk of high blood pressure. For a good night’s rest, avoid caffeine after noon, leave work at the office, and skip late-night TV. Oversleeping may be a sign of depression or a treatable sleep disorder, so talk with your doctor.",
			"11. Keep good company",
			"Diabetes is more likely to strike women who live alone. Women who live alone are 2.5 times more likely to develop diabetes than women who live with a partner, other adults, or children, according to a study published in Diabetes Care. Researchers examined what role household status played in the progression of impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes among 461 women, ages 50 to 64, and found higher risk among women living alone. But don’t freak out if you live solo: Lifestyle factors could explain this finding. Women who lived alone were also more likely to smoke and less likely to have healthy dietary habits or consume alcohol. (How Healthy Are Your Friendships?)",
			"12. Have a blood test",
			"Many diabetes symptoms are silent. A simple blood test can reveal whether sugar levels put you at risk for the condition. People with prediabetes—slightly elevated blood sugar levels, between 100 and 125 mg/dl—often develop a full-blown case within 10 years. Knowing your blood sugar levels are a little high can put you on a track to steadying them—with simple diet and exercise changes—before diabetes sets in and medications may be necessary. Everyone 45 and older should have their blood sugar levels tested. Younger people who have risk factors such as being overweight, a family history, and high cholesterol and blood pressure should ask a doctor about getting tested sooner. If results are normal, get tested again within 3 years. If you have prediabetes, blood sugar should be tested again in 1 to 2 years."

			"With all its anti-lady and anti-LGBT opinions turned into official policies, The Republican National Convention has come and gone. But as the most powerful voices opposing progress for ladies rear their ugly heads, it's time we all got familiar with some of the scariest groups railing against women. While each of these groups have distinct ideologies and varying amounts of violence, there's certainly some overlap between them all. Women and queers beware, here are some trolls to watch out for, because they're not hiding under bridges anymore:",
			"1. Gamergate",
			"Swatting, What may have started out as a debate on ethics in video game journalism quickly turned into an organized syndicate of virulently anti-women harassers. Composed largely of male video game players, the group organized around harassing women in the video game industry like Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu , as well as cultural critic Anita Sarkeesian . While the group claims to be concerned with rooting out corruption in entertainment media, it has since become explicitly clear that they largely exist to terrorize female video gamers and video game creators as a political statement against cultural diversification and liberal social criticisms of media. They often resort to frightening and aggressive tactics including doxing calling in bomb threats to events , and stalking.",
			"2. The Alt-Right",
			"reversal of Roe V. Wade and regularly oppose equal pay for women, weren't bad enough! The internet has spawned a new breed of young extremists who have labeled themselves the alt-right. With openly gay troll Milo Yiannopoulos leading the group, the alt-right advocate a new kind of libertarianism that includes within it extremely violent misogynistic, pro-gun, and racist rhetoric. Largely young and extremely loud, the group has gotten behind Trump and tend to proliferate their ideas through hateful internet memes and social media nastiness. The alt-right speaks out strongly against political correctness and multiculturalism. As if regular Republicans, who have officially endorsed the, weren't bad enough! The internet has spawned a new breed of young extremists who have labeled themselves the alt-right. With openly gay trollleading the group, the alt-right advocate a new kind of libertarianism that includes within it extremely. Largely young and extremely loud, the group has gotten behind Trump and tend to proliferate their ideas through hateful internet memes and social media nastiness. The alt-right speaks out strongly against political correctness and multiculturalism.",
			"3. New Atheists",
			"Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens, who pursued their atheism with a frightening fervor. There's nothing inherently anti-feminist about atheism, of course, but this newer group's figureheads tend to not have a great track record when it comes to women's issues. Similarly, the loudest new atheists tend to Not everyone believes in god. That's cool! But when you extrapolate your disdain for religion into a political position that comes down against women and non white people, you kind of end up being a jerk! Take for example writers like, and, who pursued their atheism with a frightening fervor. There's nothing inherently anti-feminist about atheism, of course, but this newer group's figureheads tend to. Similarly, the loudest new atheists tend to loudly espouse chauvinism , perhaps with the intention of purposefully alienating sympathetic women, who they often view as biologically inferior.",
			"4. Men's Rights Activists",
			"spamming Occidental College's anonymous rape reporting form with false reports and plastering Edmonton with posters explaining, \"Just because you regret a one-night stand doesn't mean it wasn't consensual.\" Men, in fact, do face a particular gendered set of challenges that are too often ignored in feminist conversations including unequal paternity leave, unfair custody arrangements, the lack of discussions around the rape of men, the disproportionate prevalence of suicide among men, and the repressive nature of masculinity as a cultural force. But Men's Rights Activists, who could have rallied around these important issues for progressive purposes, have instead decided that their goal should be to violate women. MRAs often target rape victims, justifying their abuse by saying that fallacious accounts of rape of women are as much of a problem as rape itself. Rejecting the claim that women are oppressed by society, MRAs have taken to abusive tactics likeOccidental College's anonymous rape reporting form with false reports and plastering Edmonton with posters explaining, \"Just because you regret a one-night stand doesn't mean it wasn't consensual.\"",
			"5. Red Pillers",
			"two trans women to make an implicit queer and feminist commentary on society. Ok, this one's confusing. Remember that scene in The Matrix where Morpheus offers Neo a Red Pill or a Blue Pill? And he says that the Red Pill will reveal an unseen reality that he heretofore could never have understood? That's how Red Pillers feel about learning the lies propagated by feminists. Red Pillers believe that the concept of \" male privilege \" is an elaborate scheme created by women to disempower men. Convinced that a series of cultural niceties catered to women (having doors help open for them, men paying for dinner, etc...) amounts to the institutional subjugation of men, Red Pillers certainly have had trouble reconciling the fact that the movie from which they take their name was, in fact, created byto make an",

What do men do when they feel so defeated by feminism that they'll never find a reasoanable date? They swear off women completely, apparently. Men Going Their Own Way is a group of straight dudes who aspire to live entirely without women in their lives (unless they are hiring or deceiving them for sex).

		],

		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Here's a life tip for you - if a stranger ever comes up to you in the street, telling you he'll give you a dollar bill for free, and all you have to do is catch it between your fingers when he drops it, get the hell out of there, it's a trap!",
			"Seriously though, test it out with a friend, and unless you're an exceptional human being, you will never ever catch that dollar bill. But don't feel bad - there's a mathematical reason for why it can't be done, and it's rooted in the biological fact that the reaction time for most humans is about 0.2 seconds.",
			"Yep, 0.2 seconds approximately how long it takes for you to see something, process it, and physically react to it, which is actually pretty impressive when you think about it. But that's not nearly quick enough for your eyes to see that falling dollar bill, and have your brain to process that information, and instruct your fingers to snap together in time to catch it.",
			"So case closed, right? Well not quite, because you're perfectly capable of catching things on the fly - humans aren't completely useless - so why not some sweet, sweet cash?",
			"As the Numberphile video above explains, it all comes down to some good old high school maths. We all know that when we drop an item from a height, you can figure out the time it will take to get to the ground based on the falling velocity and the distance travelled. Or you can figured out the distance travelled based on the falling velocity and time it takes to get to the ground.",
			"You just need to use an equation like this, D = 1/2 gt2, where D = distance, t = time, g = gravititation acceleration, and gt = falling velocity. On Earth, gravitational acceleration is measured at 9.8 m/s2, but for the purposes of this calculation, Numberphile mathematician Tadashi Tokieda has rounded that value up to 10.",
			"If all that is giving you maths homework nightmares, don't worry, the video above does all the work. Just sit back, relax, and feel smart by osmosis.",
			"So when you use this equation to figure out a distance based on the human reaction time of 0.2 seconds and gravitational acceleration value of 10, you get 0.2 metres, or 20 cm.",
			"If you measure a dollar bill, you'll find that it's around 15 cm long, which means that if someone is holding it at 5 cm or less above your fingers, it's pretty much impossible for you to react fast enough to catch it. Curse you, slow mortal brain!",
			"But don't give up just yet, because there is hope if your one dream in life is to catch falling money between your fingers.",
			"You'll have to watch the Numberphile video above to find out why even someone without above average reaction times could improve their chances of achieving this feat, but let's just say if you do agree to that stranger's bet in the street, make sure he lets you choose which fingers to use.",

			"Do you work more than 40 hours a week? If you're an entrepreneur or small business owner, it's hard not to, but all that extra time in the workplace isn't necessarily a good thing. After a certain point, it can be counterproductive and even hazardous to your health, so it's imperative to know when to say no to more hours.",
			"What the research says.",
			"Various organizations and independent researchers have looked at the physical, mental, emotional, and social effects of working beyond the standard 40 hours a week. Notable findings include the following:",
			"Working more than 10 hours a day is associated with a 60 percent jump in risk of cardiovascular issues.",
			"10 percent of those working 50 to 60 hours report relationship problems; the rate increases to 30 percent for those working more than 60 hours.",
			"Working more than 40 hours a week is associated with increased alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as unhealthy weight gain in men and depression in women.",
			"Little productive work occurs after 50 hours per week.",
			"In companies with normal overtime, only 23 percent had absentee rates above 9 percent. In companies with high overtime, 54 percent had absentee rates above 9 percent.",
			"Individuals working 11 hours or more of overtime have an increased depression risk.",
			"Injury rates increase as work hours increase. Those who work 60 hours per week have a 23 percent higher injury hazard rate.",
			"In companies with an 8.7 percent overtime rate, researchers found no fatigue-related problems. When the overtime rate was 12.4 percent, however, fatigue-related problems were minor. By the time the overtime rate hit 15.4 percent, fatigue-related problems were severe.",
			"In manufacturing industries, a 10 percent increase in overtime yields a 2.4 percent decrease in productivity.",
			"In white collar jobs, productivity declines by as much as 25 percent when workers put in 60 hours or more.",
			"Many of the problems identified above tie to stress, which connect to hormonal balances. Specifically, stress raises cortisol, which can disrupt sleep, appetite, blood pressure, immune system function, memory/cognition, mood, and more.",
			"A general guideline for your wellbeing.",
			"The available research shows that most workers in the U.S. already are working close to the point where problems can start to occur. Despite how pervasive the managerial idea still is that working employees harder always translates to a better bottom line, science says that your company isn't going to gain much, if anything, if you put in much more than an extra hour or two a day. Don't work more than 50 hours if you value your health, happiness, and connections to others."

			"Let’s face it, most people are entirely unaware of the methods used to produce the food they eat every day. There might be a sort of idyllic image of farm involved somewhere, but by and large, the reality of how food – especially meat, dairy, eggs, and fish – gets to the table is shrouded in mystery. Awareness of the type of facilities where animals are raised is increasing, as more consumers actively seek out labels like \"pasture-raised\" and \"cage-free\" thinking they are in some way superior. But in the case of fish, things are a little less clear.",
			"In recent years, wild caught and farm raised has become a distinction between various types of fish found in the grocery store, but can most frequently be seen attached to salmon. The average American consumes two pounds of salmon a year, around two-thirds of which comes from farmed sources in China, Norway, and Canada. While wild-caught is largely self-explanatory, what exactly does farm raised mean in the context of fish, mainly salmon?",
			"Floating Pig Farms",
			"Around 40 percent of all fish consumed annually, are raised on aquafarms which can either be land-based or ocean-based. Land-based farms raise thousands of fish in ponds, pools or even concrete tanks, where ocean-based aquafarms house fish in isolated cages either off-shore or in the open water.",
			"In both cases, fish are overstocked and have little space to swim or display their natural behaviors, creating an extremely stressful environment. Around 40 percent of aquafarmed fish will die before they are harvested. And with good reason. Stocking thousands of fish in a small amount of space and feeding them protein pellets (ironically made from other fish) doused with antibiotics and chemicals, such as PCB, understandably makes for highly polluted water. If you’ve ever had a fish and seen what it looks like when you forget to clean their tanks for a few weeks ... you can start to fathom the idea.",
			"Daniel Pauly, professor of fisheries at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, likens aquafarms to, \"floating pig farms.\""

			"Rio 2016 – will Brazil be ready?"
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Rio de Janeiro. The type of city that never fails to look good on television. The carnival city, sandwiched between sea and sheer cliffs, a city that lives for ball games, beach life and beautiful views.",
			"It should, then, be the perfect Olympic city too, a sporting mecca in a continent that has never hosted an Olympic Games.",
			"So why, with just 30 days to go, are people so concerned about what might happen? With people both inside Brazil and around the world in desperate need for something to cheer about, why are there so many worried frowns?",
			"And can anything be done to save the successor to London 2012?",
			"Are the Rio Olympic venues ready?",
			"Rio 2016 is split across four different zones across the city. The largest, the Olympic Park in Barra, just west of Rio, is, to put it graciously, a work in progress.",
			"When we visit, just a week before the BBC and the rest of the world's media are due to move in, the area is an open expanse of concrete, lorries and white tents surrounding venues that are supposedly complete, but in reality still have plenty of work to do. What's certainly lacking is some much-needed carnival colour.",
			"What the Olympic Park should look like...",
			"What it actually looks like...",
			"We visited the Aquatics Centre and the basketball venues, two stadia that have been completed. The swimming pool had water, but scaffolding still covered the upper tiers. Visible wiring round the spectator concourse of the basketball venue suggested at the very least a stripped back approach to venue construction.",
			"The delayed velodrome meanwhile was only signed off by the builders on Sunday 26 June. The first time spectators will actually enter the venue will be on the first day of competition.",
			"\"Of course there are still question marks and challenges as to how the venue will perform,\" said Rodrigo Garcia, sport director for Rio 2016 . However, he added that the 45 test events held across the Olympic venues, some with spectators and some without, give him confidence that the Park will deliver.",
			"\"We have really simple venues, we’re not planning fancy stadiums here in Rio,\" he said. \"We cannot go against the financial crisis that Brazil is living through today. There is no extra budget for us to expand on what should be in place for the Games.\"",
			"For the first time this year, there is a new way to see what’s going on inside the Olympic Park. Google Street View have been mapping the whole area, including inside the venues themselves. It’s a neat concept, giving spectators who can't make it to Rio a Bolt's Eye View of the action.",
			"Except not all the venues are ready for Google’s 360-degree, 15-camera backpack to come and shoot. \"Some venues haven’t been photographed because they are not ready yet. We have everything set to do things before the Olympics.\" said Google Brazil Partnerships spokesperson Carlos Aranha.",
			"We can't wait to poke around the rest.",
			"Why are they cutting it so fine?",
			"Quite simply, because Rio and Brazil are facing the worst economic recession in their history, worse even than the Wall Street Crash, say organisers.",
			"With fewer than 50 days to go until the Opening Ceremony, the city of Rio declared a \"state of public calamity\" , warning that without an injection of cash they would not be able to honour their commitment to the Games – or, for that matter, keep public health, security and education services running.",
			"If it sounds alarmist, that's because it is. The move immediately triggered additional investment from Brazil's federal government.",
			"Add to that a political crisis which saw the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in May , a collapse in oil prices and a rise in violence in the city, and you start to realise that putting on a Games is the least of Brazil's problems.",
			"That said, at no point during my trip did I, as a tourist, feel at risk, any more so than I would walking around London. Don't forget either, that with just two weeks to go until London 2012, the Army was called in after G4S confirmed they would not be able to provide enough private security guards.",
			"Rio isn't the first Olympic city to face doom-laden predictions, and it won't be the last. But Rio's problems far outweigh London's from four years ago.",
			"\"Many people ask us, ‘Wow, you’re in a lot of trouble’,\" said Rio 2016 communications director Adriana Garcia. \"Yes, we are, that’s true. We’re very transparent about it.",
			"\"Brazil is melting,\" she said. \"We have the worst political and economic crisis ever. We are facing a very challenging environment but we are confident that we will deliver a Games that will make people hopeful of a better situation.\"",
			"The total cost of the Games currently stands at 39 billion Brazilian reais – roughly $4.6 billion. That is far less than the $15 billion price tag of London 2012",
			"\"It may not be the luxury site that people want,\" said Garcia. \"But it’s what we have, it’s what we offer, it’s going to be the Frugal Games.\"",
			"Will the Games make people happy?",
			"Philip Wilkinson is the international media manager for Rio 2016. Four years ago, he was on the communications team for Team GB, before he decided to follow the Games to South America.",
			"\"Brazilians are passionate about sport, and the city of Rio lends itself to it,\" he said. \"It’s surrounded by the ocean, the forest, the mountains, that lends itself to outdoor activities. It’s the perfect place to host the Games.\"",
			"Ipanema Beach in Rio De Janiero, the perfect backdrop to the Games?",
			"He's right, Rio is seemingly full of athletes, from kids playing footvolley on the beach to hardened cyclists winding their way up to Christ the Redeemer.",
			"Security in the Barra Olympic Park",
			"But that doesn't mean everyone thinks the Games is money well spent. This is just the latest in a series of mega events that began with the Pan American Games in 2007, through to the World Cup in 2014.",
			"As always, debate is fierce surrounding the 'Olympic legacy'. In Rio, it's all about transport, an effort to solve the city's crippling traffic problems.",
			"\"There are projects that have been wanted for 30 or 40 years and have been gathering dust,\" said Wilkinson. \"Like the new Metro line connecting the west with the centre of the city. Like the four new bus rapid transit lines.\"",
			"The metro is yet to be finished. Another legacy project, the cleaning of the polluted harbour where the sailing will take place, has already been canned.",
			"\"The bay won’t be cleaned as promised,\" said Garcia. \"When Brazil won the bid it promised that it would clean 80 per cent of the bay. Only 40 per cent will be cleaned.\" But, she assured me, the sailors taking part in the Games will \"be able to compete in the best situation possible\".",
			"The Olympics brings other things, of course. Google has not just been photographing the inside of stadia. The company has been re-mapping the city for locals and tourists, as well as working with NGO Affroreggae to map some of Rio's bewildering favelas, highlighting local businesses and showing that there's another side to these poor neighbourhoods.",
			"In the end, it's not for outside broadcasters – who come in, marvel at the views, marvel at the sport – to decide whether the Olympics is money well spent. That's for Rio locals, the 'cariocas', to hold the organisers to account.",
			"\"The Olympic Games is designed to overcome whatever else is happening in the world,\" says BBC commentator and former athlete Brendan Foster, a veteran of 12 Olympic Games. \"Rio has followed the script. The stadiums won't be ready, there's disease, the public are turning their back, the country's facing economic disaster, all the sports face drugs issues, there's security, terrorism, all those things.\"",
			"\"The Olympics has become a worldwide spectacle haunted by world-impacting problems,\" he added. \"Brazil is finding it tough, and is already finding it tough. But these Games will rise beyond all those issues. What happens is sport takes over. We go there not to measure the strength of the Brazilian government; we go there to share in the greatest athletes in the world doing their thing.\"",
			"For Brazil's sake, let's hope he's right."

			"Google Assistant could be the killer bot, but it’s missing a key feature"
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"As Google Allo becomes available worldwide, just over a week into its existence, its Google Assistant is already being called a standout in the rapidly growing field of bots.",
			"Pete Skomoroch, founder of early-stage startup Skipflag and formerly a principal data scientist at LinkedIn, called the search engine-powered Google Assistant \"the best I’ve ever used.\"",
			"Other people in the bot ecosystem, like Matrix Partners investor and former Facebook Parse cofounder Ilya Sukhar, have had similarly rosy things to say about Allo.",
			"\"Allo’s assistant seems best in class. Everything else is meh,\" Sukhar tweeted shortly after the release of the chat app.",
			"This is the beginning, said Google vice president of engineering Scott Huffman, the \"first time you’re able to have conversation with Google.\"",
			"This virtual assistant has the power to answer questions, perform translations, or plan a night out, and it is already embedded in Allo. But in the coming months it will also become part of Google Home and a true competitor to Amazon Alexa and other virtual assistants inside devices.",
			"Allo’s release comes at a time of rapid change and investment in chat apps.",
			"The race to the killer bot",
			"If you haven’t followed along, here’s where we are in the chat wars.",
			"In the span of less than six months, Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft — hands down some of the biggest tech companies in the world — either launched a bot platform for their chat app, gave developers access to their platform so they can make their own bots, or, in the case of Google, created a new chat app.",
			"Since April, tens of thousands of developers have created bots for Facebook Messenger, Kik, Slack, and the like. But none of these has been a breakout hit, the one that — like a rising tide — has the potential to lift the collective boats of virtual assistants and the bot ecosystem in general. In short, there’s been no killer bot — until Google Assistant.",
			"Microsoft’s Tay had potential to be a killer bot. But it turned out to be a racist, sexist jerk that smoked weed in front of the police. We checked: There are no plans for Tay to make a return at this time, a Microsoft spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email.",
			"It’s not an apples-to-apples comparison, exactly, Tay and Google Assistant. Tay was made to be more conversational than what we’ve seen from Google Assistant so far, but Tay was derived from Xiaoice, a bot made by Bing researchers that has the ability to do many of the things Google Assistant can do today.",
			"So it could be that Google — the last of the tech giants to show us its consumer-facing chat client for the coming chat wars — has built the first killer bot.",
			"What Google Assistant gets right",
			"Already downloaded 10 million times on Android, Allo and its Google Assistant are not without flaws, but here are a few things they do get right.",
			"First, Google Assistant leverages the powerful search capabilities that made Google a verb and a multi-billion dollar company. As my colleague Emil Protalinski described it, Google Assistant is \"like chatting with Google Search and Google Now in one.\"",
			"Second, Allo appears to fundamentally understand the importance of group chat. Want to send a new message with Allo? Before you see Incognito Mode, Google Assistant, or your friends, you see \"Start a new group chat.\" The ability to operate a bot within a group immediately gives Allo an advantage over platforms like Facebook Messenger, which does not allow bots to chat in groups.",
			"While in group chat, you can do Google searches together, look for a restaurant together, play group games, and, it appears, do anything else Google Assistant can do.",
			"This will be even more powerful when Google Assistant can make purchases, schedule appointments, or complete tasks for a group.",
			"Another standout feature: Smart Reply. Over time, Google Assistant promises to suggest responses based on the way you speak and your response to thumbs-up / thumbs-down surveys, given at the end of each query. More than generic common answers, Google Assistant learns your lingo and common responses.",
			"One more plus: Google Assistant may not be the only bot on Allo for long.",
			"The race to conversational commerce",
			"A day before the public launch of Allo, Google announced the acquisition of API.ai, a platform for building bots and virtual assistants through chat platforms and devices. This suggests that Google Assistant may operate alongside other bots made for the Allo platform. API.ai is currently used by more than 60,000 developers.",
			"\"API.ai offers one of the leading conversational user interface platforms, and they’ll help Google empower developers to continue building great natural language interfaces,\" Huffman wrote in a blog post.",
			"Google’s efforts underscore what exactly is up for grabs in this high-stakes game. Chat apps like Messenger and Line and WeChat and Kik have become some of the largest platforms in the world, larger than social media, and they’re now seen as a way to deliver goods and services.",
			"More than 20,000 bots have been made for Kik, tens of thousands have been made for Microsoft and Facebook, and developers appear to be very receptive to Apple’s recent launch of iOS 10 and an App Store for iMessage. Since the launch of iOS 10 a little over a week ago, more than 1,600 stickers or app extensions have been created for iMessage.",
			"These tech giants are beginning to build ecosystems around their platforms and their hundreds of millions of monthly active users. Even companies like Oracle and LinkedIn — companies not really associated with chat — launched bot initiatives in past weeks.",
			"This conversational commerce epiphany, and the stampede by U.S. tech giants to open platforms to third-party developers is happening in large part because of what WeChat has already accomplished in China.",
			"People use WeChat to shop, pay for services like utility bills, and speak to businesses (as well as friends). The ubiquitous app uses QR codes to bring commerce into the offline world.",
			"It’s the most popular messaging app in China, and last week WeChat parent company Tencent announced that the chat platform has started to test use of xiaochengxu, or Little Program. Little Program will allow WeChat users to download and use apps inside WeChat, similar to iMessage.",
			"Conversational commerce has been achieved in China because users can have new experiences, pay for things, and socialize with the world from inside WeChat itself. Much of what you need to do on a daily basis — split a bill, put money in a savings account, make purchases in the offline world — can be done without needing to jump into a webpage or another app.",
			"But that’s not how Allo works.",
			"Where Allo falls short",
			"Want the latest headlines in Allo? You’ll see the top three results. Tap \"More\" and you’re brought out of the app and onto the mobile web.",
			"Want to watch a YouTube video on Allo? You’re brought to the YouTube app. Want to watch a YouTube video when using iMessage? You watch the video inside iMessage.",
			"Upon its release, Google said Allo was made to solve the problem that happens every time you need to leave the app. This is the problem that arises when you’re chatting with a friend in order to figure out what you want to do tonight and need to search for a restaurant or check movie times.",
			"If the purpose of Allo is to solve this problem, it’s going to need to do more inside Allo.",
			"Building conversational commerce for a platform is largely about providing a holistic experience within a single chat app. Today Allo’s experience stitches together aspects of the Google suite of apps, web search, and the chat app.",
			"In the chat wars ahead, if other messaging app companies manage to get their own ecosystems operating primarily inside their apps — doing away with the need to leave to talk to a business, add a friend to the conversation, or buy groceries — they stand a good chance of converting users.",
			"It may only be the beginning for Allo and the chat wars, but whether Allo succeeds or not may depend on how much of the Allo experience is woven together from web searches and the suite of Google apps, and how much of it operates within Allo."

When Kornhorst was properly hydrated, she was brought to the ICU in critical condition. Yesterday's update on a GoFundMe for Kornhorst explains:",

			"Tornadoes are expected to continue to affect the area with a possible chance of hail on May 9.",
			"Yet unusual prom experiences are far more common than many might think, Jezebel reports.",
			"In one particularly rough incident, an unidentified girl discovered she was allergic to shellfish on her prom day.",
			"\"As I started to scratch my neck I felt a lump about the size of an egg at the base of my skull,\" the girl wrote to Jezebel. \"It was also at about this point that all of my friends noticed that I was the color of a tomato.\"",
			"She was forced to go to the hospital shortly after.",
			"\"Suffice to say, I had a pretty hefty crowd (practically the entire Junior and Senior class) watch as I blew up like a red balloon and had to be carted out on a stretcher in front of everyone,\" she wrote. \"When I got to the hospital I got to have my beautiful, expensive dress cut off of me and I spent the rest of the night hooked up to IVs as my friends danced the night away.\"",
			"In a more disturbing story, one former high school student recalled a prom tainted by recent allegations regarding the teacher in charge. The teacher, who had reportedly won the \"Favorite Teacher\" award several times, had allegedly been involved in sexual misconduct with a student.",
			"He resigned weeks before the prom and reportedly took all the funds designated for the prom. He later pleaded guilty to the sexual misconduct charge.",
			"\"The whole evening had an unspoken dirtiness to it,\" the student wrote."

			"When drug lord Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán was spirited from a high-security prison in central Mexico to one just miles from the US border under the cover of darkness on May 7 , many saw it as a step toward the fate that terrifies drug traffickers: extradition to the US.",
			"According to Jhon Jairo Velásquez Vásquez — Pablo Escobar's top hitman — extradition to the US is the fate that drug barons like Escobar and Guzmán fear most",
			"In the jails and prisons of Latin America, kingpins often exercise a great deal of influence.",
			"detained at Puente Grande Federal Prison from 1993 to 2001, for example, Guzmán was allowed to host his family for a vacation inside the prison grounds, held multiple parties for friends, and had female inmates brought to the all-male jail for his enjoyment, Mexican journalist Anabel Hernandez said in an interview. While",
			"The US legal and prison systems, however, strip drug barons of their power.",
			"Extradition threatens powerful narcos like Escobar and Guzmán because they would be cut off from their cartel business, their family, and corrupt authorities willing to accept bribes.",

			"said. The 'wanted' poster is very dangerous for us as bandits because you go to a store to buy a drink and there's your photo. Someone sees it on TV and knows you are worth 10 million dollars,\" Popeye",
			"For Guzmán, the yearslong \"wanted poster\" portion of his criminal career, which included two brazen prison escapes , appears to have given way to the extradition portion.",
			". . View gallery .",
			"Mexican officials dismissed the possibility of his extradition to the US after Guzmán was captured in 2014, but the government seemed to be changing its mind before his breakout last July.",
			"received the extradition request on June 25, but Guzmán slipped out of prison through a mile-long tunnel two weeks later . The extradition of Guzmán to the US was already in the works, according to the Mexican attorney general's office — Mexico",
			"Now, four months after Guzmán was reapprehended in January , he sits in a jail outside Ciudad Juarez, miles from El Paso, Texas. A Mexican judge recently signed off on the legal proceedings involved in the kingpin's extradition, but diplomatic and political hurdles remain.",
			"It seems unlikely that Guzmán will arrive on US territory anytime soon, but the move does put him within surveillance range of US intelligence assets in Texas, which could help Mexico prevent or respond to an escape attempt.",
			"And, as Nathan P. Jones of Rice University's Baker Institute has noted , the new location puts Guzmán near El Paso, where he faces indictment and where he can be moved quickly if the Mexican government decides to expedite his extradition.",

			"(El Proceso)",
			"Popeye was Escobar's chief assassin during the final years of the drug lord's life, and he was responsible for more than 300 assassinations and for organizing another 3,000 homicides.",
			"He spent 23 years in six different Colombian prisons after he turned himself in to authorities in 1992. He was released in August 2014.",
			"at least $50 million in bribes to authorities and prison workers since \"at [Altiplano] they have sensors and cameras to prevent tunnels,\" according to his interview with Univision, though other sources put that number much lower Popeye estimates that Guzmán's 2015 escape could have cost",
			"But no amount of money is likely to win Guzmán favor in a US prison, something the Sinaloa cartel kingpin most likely knows all to well.",

			"I remember going to my first high school dance. To be honest, there wasn’t a whole lot of actual dancing going on, with the majority of my peers just standing around along the walls. As I’m sure many of you can relate to, we were mostly very shy... oh, and perhaps the utter lack of dancing skills might have had something to do with it. While there were certainly a few very talented dancers, everyone else could only slow dance on a very elementary level. And even then, you could still bet your bottom dollar that a lot of feet were being stepped on. But hey, what do you expect? Dancing takes a lot of training and finesse that comes with many years of training and maturity. So when an adult woman was asked to step onto the dance floor by a 14-year-old boy, what do you think happened? ",
			"A full-grown woman was enjoying herself at a concert when she was approached by a 14-year-old boy who asked her for a dance. As you might imagine, she was surprised but, perhaps out of courtesy, she accepted the invitation. And that’s when the young man grabbed her by the hand and proceeded to blow everyone’s mind.",
			"The 14-year-old boy immediately and very confidently takes the lead, spinning the woman several times. The look on her face is absolutely priceless! Not only is the young man’s footwork absolutely on point, the way he is able to guide her through the dance is absolutely impressive. The woman does a great job of keeping up but if you watch the video below very closely, it’s absolutely clear who is the pro!"

			"This mystery tissue could be what's making you feel stiff, creaky...and baffled.",
			"By Corrie Pikul",
			"You're Achy, You're Sore, and You Have No Idea Why",
			"It feels like muscle pain, but unlike a tight hamstring that makes you yelp when you stand up, your ache isn't triggered by a particular movement, and you can feel it in different places at various times. The culprit could be your fascia (pronounced \"fash-ya\"), says Mary Ann Wilmarth, DPT, chief of physical therapy at Harvard University Health Services. This sheet of tissue, made up of densely packed protein fibers, weaves throughout the entire body, and it binds and supports your muscles, bones and even your organs. While bodywork specialists have been passionate about fascia for decades, Wilmarth says it took new research on how fascia and muscles work together (some of it presented at the first international fascia research conference at Harvard in 2007) to get different health pros -- from orthopedists to MDs and pain experts to personal trainers -- to catch on.",
			"How Fascia Makes You Feel",
			"You have six times as many sensory neurons loaded in your fasciae as in any other tissue of your body except for your skin, explains Jill Miller, a fitness expert and longtime fascia evangelist (she's an experienced registered yoga teacher, has presented case studies at fascia research conferences and developed the Roll Model fascia therapy program). This internal webbing helps different muscle systems communicate with one another -- they're what make you want to get out of your office chair and stretch or roll your neck around. Ideally, your fascias should be supple enough to slide, glide, twist and bind like long, thin sheets of rubber. When they're not functioning properly, signals from the nerve endings are muffled or muted (so you don't feel comfortable in your own body) or they're interpreted by your brain as pain and discomfort.",
			"Find Your Inner Feline",
			"You know how your muscles feel cramped and stiff when you wake up in the morning? After a night's sleep (or another long period of inactivity, like a car trip or plane ride), the parts of your fascia that wrap around and through your muscle fibers, which are normally stretchy and flexible, can stick together like previously chewed Hubba Bubba.",
			"The fix: The best way to release the fascia is to slowly and luxuriously stretch out your arms and legs and roll slowly from side to side before getting out of bed. This will gently pull the muscles apart and separate the connecting tissue, Wilmarth says. To get at the fascia in your calves, ankles and arches, sit on the edge of the bed and flex and point your feet before putting the pressure of your weight on them.",
			"Roll It Out Like Bread Dough",
			"Fascia can be finicky: It gets stiff and sticky when you don't move around enough, but it can also get bound up and twisted when you move too much or do repetitive motion or injure yourself through activity, says James L. Thornton, the president of the National Athletic Trainers Association.",
			"The fix: Work out overused sore spots with a foam roller. You've probably seen people at the gym using these things, which look like pool noodles, to stretch their back, hamstrings and the notoriously tight IT band on the outside of the hips (this video from Jeff Richter, a certified strength and conditioning coach at St. Vincent Sports Performance in Indianapolis, provides a good foam-roller tutorial). Thornton says to go slowly, and when you get to a sore spot that feels like a bruise, pause for 15 to 20 seconds. The discomfort should melt away as the fascia softens and the muscles release. If you feel intense pain that doesn't dissipate, Thornton says to stop and consider making an appointment with a physical therapist. At home, you can give yourself a massage with tennis balls or Yoga Tune Up balls, which grip the skin to help loosen up individual layers of fascia. Also try a device called the Stick. It lets you really go deep into your calves, shins and hamstrings, but because it's more rigid than a foam roller, the Stick can feel much more intense (think deep-tissue massage versus regular rubdown).",
			"Stretch It Out",
			"You've heard that before exercising, it's a good idea to do some dynamic stretching that includes swinging your legs and arms to improve your range of motion. This not only benefits your muscles, says Thornton, but it's also a great way to loosen up your fascia. When your muscles stay tight, the fascia clings to them, and both can become rigid over time.",
			"The fix: Take a brisk walk or jog lightly in place, and do some sports-specific moves (for example, leg swings for runners, or shoulder rolls for swimmers). Or try the lazy woman's warm-up: Start your workout, and stay at a slow, easy, I could-do-this-for-hours pace for about 5 minutes.",
			"Don't Let the Tissues Get \"Crunchy\"",
			"If you've ever had a shoulder rub and heard something that sounded like crinkling plastic under your skin, that wasn't your imagination -- it was probably your parched, stiffened fascia, says Ruth Werner, a past president of the Massage Therapy Foundation, who spent decades teaching anatomy and physiology to other therapists. The collagen fibers that make up fascia need to stay supple to work properly, and to slide over and under muscles and other inner-body surfaces.",
			"The fix: One way to keep the fascia hydrated is obvious: drink lots of fluids, says Werner. Another easy (but easily forgettable) way is to make sure you stand up, stretch and flex regularly throughout the day to keep the fascia from locking up. Werner says some research has also shown that rubbing tight areas -- as when you get a massage -- can boost circulation and warm the fascia, changing the texture to make it even more pliable.",
			"Let the Pros Handle It",
			"Because fascia is so interconnected, snags -- or adhesions, as pros call them -- in one area can affect other other areas. \"Imagine putting on multiple layers of long-sleeve shirts, and then think about how tugging on one of them would cause all of the other shirts to pull and stretch as well,\" says Cynthia Ribeiro, the president of the American Massage Therapy Association and a massage therapist. She stresses that you can't have healthy muscles without well-cared-for fascia.",
			"The fix: There are different therapeutic methods to address keeping the fascia healthy, from intense, sometimes-excruciating Rolfing to gentle fascial unwinding to myofascial release, which usually involves loading the deeper tissues with force until they start to give. If you're chronically stiff and sore, or you have a muscle injury that just won't heal, consult a specialist to see what would be right for you. Massage therapists like Ribeiro and PTs like Wilmarth have seen clients for whom nothing seemed to work...until a type of fascial therapy helped melt away their pain and stiffness."

			"Find out which grocery items have skyrocketed in price lately (plus, a surprising food that has dropped).",
			"Price Up: Bacon ",
			"Experts began predicting that prices would zoom up last year after droughts affected feed crops, and then a new virus affecting pigs migrated to the U.S. this summer, further lowering supply of this high-demand meat. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost per pound of bacon has gone up 56 percent in 10 years (from $3.14 to $4.92) — compare that to beef steaks, which are up 41 percent in 10 years. In U.S. cities, the climb has been even steeper. Over the last 12 months alone, the average price of a pound of bacon in urban areas rose 22 percent to $5.62 per pound, up from $4.61 a year earlier. But if you use bacon as an accent instead of a main course, you’ll get the salty, smoky flavor without spending as much. This stew recipe calls for just two slices.",
			"Price Up: Chocolate ",
			"News that will give chocolate lovers pause: Not only is demand up for chocolate (thanks to seemingly endless reports of its health benefits) but supply is down, thanks to a shortage of cocoa beans in West Africa (the source for the majority of the world’s beans). The result? Chocolate prices have soared to $12.25 per kilo (that’s about 2 1/4 pounds) — up 45 percent from 2007, says The Wall Street Journal. Cocoa butter prices are rising, too (that’s what gives chocolate its melt-in-your-mouth texture), which means it’s costing manufacturers more to make their product. A slightly more expensive bar may still be worth it, though (here’s a scientific reason why you should indulge, even — or especially — when you’re stressed out).",
			"Price Up: Chicken ",
			"Surveys show 94 percent of us eat chicken, and nearly four in 10 consumers say they increased their consumption of this healthy choice from 2011 to 2012. But the price of chicken — particularly boneless breasts — has risen more than many other groceries in the past six months, finds a recent survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation. That particular cut has risen 61 cents per pound, to $3.93. Bill Roenigk, chief economist for the National Chicken Council, says high corn (i.e., chicken feed) prices are partly to blame, as well as steady demand because of breast meat’s low fat and calorie content. You’ll spend less if you opt for leg meat, though",
			"Roenigk says dark meat tends to be cheaper than white, and isn’t much different, calorie-wise: about 58 calories per ounce for dark, versus 47 for white (and some experts believe it’s healthier for your heart).",
			"Price Up: Wild-Caught Fish ",
			"Wild-caught fish could be on its way to becoming a special treat: The global fish-price index of the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) hit a record high earlier this year, a result of increased demand and a surge in oil prices (which has a big impact on the cost of operating fishing boats and transporting the catch). Fish that is wild (not farmed) has seen the sharpest price hike, nearly doubling between 1990 and 2012, whereas the index for farmed fish rose by only a fifth (here’s why). Some of the best eco- (and wallet-) friendly options are farm-raised striped bass or farm-raised rainbow trout, which sell for about $8 a pound and have relatively light impact on the environment. That’s significantly lower than wild-caught fish that offer a similar taste and texture, such as cod (which ranges from $14 to $25 a pound) or halibut ($24 a pound).",
			"Price Down: Honeycrisp Apples ",
			"The \"designer\" apple known as honeycrisp is sweet, juicy, snappy — and (historically, anyway) pricey, costing as much as $4.50 a pound while in-season Cortlands went for $1.50 a pound. Whether because of the catchy name or the truly sweet taste, demand has jumped in recent years, and, until recently, supply couldn’t keep up, since apple trees take five or so years to begin producing fruit in enough quantities to sell commercially. (This fascinating article explains more.) Finally, though, all those honeycrisp trees are meeting demand, and the USDA’s National Fruit and Vegetable Retail report says the variety is actually now going for 14 percent less per pound than it was last year."

			"How has an Aussie act entered 2015's EUROVISION competition?",
			"It's the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song contest and the organisers have added a surprising wildcard in the form of Australia - a country not traditionally in Europe. Or factually. Or even metaphorically. But the contest has had a cult following Down Under (think how much we liked Neighbours and Prisoner Cell Block H) for many years and has been given a one-off invitation this year.",
			"An Australian jury panel will submit the Australian vote and Australia may well be televoting along with other European countries. This seems plausible as Australia has run its own online vote (which has no bearing on the competition) since 2010.",
			"And one of the Aussies' more successful musical exports (apart from Nick Cave, Kylie and INXS) is of course Bjorn Again - the wildly successful parody act which pays tribute to Eurovision's most famous winner, Abba. Here's their version of Waterloo (which won Eurovision for the Swedes in 1974). Check out those bell-bottoms. Those judo outfits. That hair!",
			"When is it on? The 2015 Song Contest takes place this Saturday with Graham Norton supplying his usual commentary. It is set to air on BBC One and BBC Radio 2 at 8pm. If Australians want to watch the contest live, it will be aired by Australian broadcaster SBS at 5am Sunday morning Australian Eastern Standard Time, and repeated later at 7.30pm Sunday night.",
			"Where is it being held? After Austria's Conchita Wurst won last year, the 2015 Eurovison Song Contest will travel to her home country. The show will come live from the Wiener Stadthalle in Vienna.",
			"So what's the deal? The bookies have made X Factor Australia judge Guy Sebastian one of the favourites to win in Vienna.",
			"The Malaysian-born singer-songwriter was the first winner of Australian Idol in 2003, and signalled his intent by penning a whole slew of potential songs in just three days. The one that made the cut is an jaunty R&B jam called Tonight Again which echoes Mark Ronson's recent global smash Uptown Funk. For those who may have woken up from a deep sleep, This is Uptown Funk:",
			"And the bookies odds are..?",
			"Sweden is the favourite to take this year's crown with Måns Zelmerlöw's track 'Heroes', being listed at 7/4 to win by William Hill.",
			"So what if Guy wins it for Australia?",
			"Now here's an interesting one. Traditionally the winning country is the host of next year's contest so if Australia takes the prize will the whole of Europe have to traipse over to Oz in a sea of sequins and glitter?",
			"No-one is sure. Organisers have said that Australia can't host the competition, but their broadcaster SBS could co-organise the event with another European country where the contest would take place.",
			"And will Australia be invited to defend their title? This hasn't been confirmed either but it's likely that they will be permitted an entry if the move is a hit with the viewers.",
			"It's an 'historic' step which will take the contest to a 'new global level' say the organisers.",
			"Michael Ebeid, managing director of broadcaster SBS, which airs the show in Australia, said: \"We are very excited to have secured this historic opportunity for Australia to be represented on the world's biggest stage at the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest and are honoured that the European Broadcasting Union has supported us to achieve this ambition.",
			"\"SBS has been broadcasting Eurovision for over 30 years and we have seen how Australians' love of the song contest has grown during those years.\"",
			"Executive supervisor of the contest Jon Ola Sand who works for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said: \"It's a daring and at the same time incredibly exciting move. It is our way of saying 'let's celebrate this party together'.\"",
			"Alexander Wrabetz director general of host broadcasters ORF, said: \"The song contest has developed in its history to become the biggest TV entertainment event in the world.",
			"\"With the participation of Australia, together with our partners at the EBU and SBS, we have succeeded to lift it to a new global level and to build another bridge for the 60th anniversary - a bridge that spans the globe, starting from the heart of Europe.\"",
			"Electro Velvet are the UK's entrant for this year's Eurovision Song Contest."

		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Jimmy John's, the \"freaky fast\" sandwich staple of America's college towns, is being sued by two former employees for what they describe as \"systematic wage theft\" at the fast food chain.",
			"In their lawsuit filed Friday in federal court, Karolis Kubelskas and Emily Brunner claim that they were forced to regularly work off the clock because of unreasonably low payroll budgets provided to individual Jimmy John's stores, leading to minimum wage and overtime violations.",
			"Jimmy John's has \"intentionally and repeatedly misrepresented the true time worked by their hourly employees\" in order to keep costs down and dodge overtime laws, the complaint alleges. The lawsuit is a proposed class action, with Kubelskas and Brunner arguing that such pay practices come from \"corporate set policies\" and would apply to other workers.",
			"Jimmy John's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
			"According to Kubelskas and Brunner, Jimmy John's workers aren't given enough time to complete all their closing duties at the end of the day, at which point managers clock them out regardless of whether or not they continue to work. The practice is exacerbated, they claim, by a company policy that bases managers' bonuses largely on whether or not they hit their targets on labor costs.",
			"The system, they say, \"has the practical effect of creating widespread wage theft.\"",
			"Brunner, who's represented by the Chicago firm Foote, Mielke, Chavez & O’Neil, originally filed suit against the company in July, but she filed an additional, joint complaint with Kubelskas last week. Both suits name JS Fort Group, which they describe as a franchisee, as a defendant alongside Jimmy John's Enterprises.",
			"Founded in Illinois in 1983, Jimmy John's has built its foundation on the \"irreverent attitude and dirt-cheap prices\" championed by its founder, Jimmy John Liautaud, according to the company's website. The sandwich chain now has more than 1,900 locations throughout the U.S., and it was often highlighted as an entrepreneurial success story by failed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney on the 2012 campaign trail.",
			"Of Jimmy John's employees, the company's site says, \"They don't mind doing whatever it takes to get the job done. Their hustle is part of how they live their daily lives, and they enjoy the fruits of a hard-earned entrepreneurial lifestyle.\"",
			"The proposed class action isn't the first time Jimmy John's has been the target of a lawsuit from workers. Last November, 300 delivery drivers sued a major Jimmy John's franchise operator, claiming that the auto expenses they were forced to bear pushed their earnings below the minimum wage.",
			"In 2011, a group of 10 Jimmy John's locations became the target of a heated labor organizing campaign by the Industrial Workers of the World, who'd launched a then-rare bid to unionize fast food workers. The union narrowly lost the election, and six workers later claimed they were fired due to their union support. In 2012, an administrative law judge sided with the workers."

			"Bill Nye: Is reality just a computer simulation? Here's what science tells us..."
		],
		"postPlatform": "reddit",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Are we living in a holographic simulation created by a supercomputer beyond our comprehension? That question occurs again and again in science fiction, perhaps most notably in The Matrix, a film in which unreality is so pristine that no one notices the truth. That we are all actually, truly living in such a matrix seems laughable until you consider the advances made by video games in the last few decades.",
			"Not long ago, all we had was pong: two rectangles and a circle. Today we have virtual reality consoles which are edging toward an experience indistinguishable from reality, or at least what we think of as reality. Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX cofounder, was recently asked this question: Is it possible that the world as we know it is just a simulation made by someone else?",
			"His response is perhaps startling, saying that the chances of this reality being a \"base\" reality are \"one in billions.\" To make matters even more confusing, humans are increasingly turning to virtual reality devices to escape this \"reality.\" Thorsten Wiedemann, for example, spent forty-eight hours wearing his Oculus Rift device, proving it is possible to live within a virtual reality at least for a short time.",
			"When we asked Bill Nye the Science Guy if he thinks we are living in a computer-generated simulation, he turned to some basic scientific principles to justify his answer. Science ultimately demands testable, repeatable hypotheses to proceed, but how do you test whether we are living in a computer simulation or not? There just doesn't seem to be a way.",
			"There is every possibility that this is a hyper-real version of The Sims, and we wouldn’t know. If we had never seen the outside world, there’s no reason we would know it exists, that we’re missing it. So if we as a people had only ever existed in this hyper real video game, we wouldn’t know it was all just a game.",
			"That is why it is \"unknowable,\" according to Bill Nye. If we were in a video game, human minds would not be able to detect the outside world until \"something goes wrong,\" i.e. a glitch in the matrix. Still, Nye wishes luck to anyone wanting to design such an experiment. It might take some time, but perhaps could be done..."

			"You guys, Grimace was originally evil and had FOUR ARMS.",
			"1. McDonald’s original menu item staple was HOT DOGS not hamburgers! Weird, right?",
			"2. There are more McDonald’s in the US than (gulp) hospitals. But there are more libraries in the US than McDonald’s so go grab a book, people.",
			"3. McNuggets are available in four distinct shapes: bell, boot, ball, and bone. They’re given their specific ~lewk~ by being pressed out of a cookie cutter, and are shaped similarly in order to make sure that they’ll all cook the same.",
			"4. The fast-food giant sells around 75 hamburgers PER SECOND. Per second, ya’ll.",
			"5. That super-catchy, mega-annoying \"I’m Lovin’ It\" jingle was written by Pharrell and recorded by Justin Timberlake.",
			"6. In case you were wondering, you can get married at McDonald’s restaurants in Hong Kong. For $1,200 you’ll get invites, balloon wedding rings (whatever those are), a bridal bouquet, and your very own emcee for the day.",
			"7. More people recognize the McDonald’s logo than the cross, according to a 1995 survey of 7,000 people in six countries. That’s...really something.",
			"8. The cult fave McRib sandwich has more than 70 ingredients, but it’s mainly made of tripe, heart, and scalded stomach.",
			"9. The company came up with the McRib after it sold so many McNuggets that it caused an actual poultry shortage in the US.",
			"10. And it invented the Filet-O-Fish after a franchise owner in a super Catholic town in Ohio realized that a lot of people gave up hamburgers for Lent. McDonald’s founder Ray Kroc initially wanted to replace the hamburger with a Hula Burger — a piece of pineapple covered with cheese — instead. EW.",
			"5. 11. Maybe one of the weirdest McDonald’s is the floating McDonald’s McBARGE in Vancouver. It was built for the 1986 Expo and then lay decommissioned for several decades. The barge was refurbished in 2016 but sadly it probably won’t be revived as a McDonald’s.",
			"12. The brand launched its first drive-thru in 1975 somewhat out of necessity. Its Sierra Vista, Arizona, location was near a military base, and soldiers weren’t permitted to leave their cars while wearing fatigues, so the company decided to bring the food to them in their cars instead.",
			"13. Ray Kroc, who turned McDonald’s into an international chain, was interested in purchasing the original McDonald’s restaurant after he saw the McDonald brothers’ implementation of what they called the \"Speedee System.\" It was essentially the precursor to assembly line–prepped fast food as we know it.",
			"14. The biggest fast food chain in the country is actually Subway, not McDonald’s. Subway has more than 40,000 locations while McDonald’s has around 35,400.",
			"15. McDonald’s feeds around 62 million people every day, which is more people than live in Great Britain.",
			"7. 16. The world record for the most Big Macs eaten belongs to Donald Gorske of Fon du Lac, Wisconsin. As of August 24, 2016, he’s had 28,788 Big Macs and typically averages around 14 a week.",
			"17. There’s a McDonald’s café in Paris that (gasp!) doesn’t sell hamburgers or French fries! Instead, the McCafé offers coffee, teas, soups, macarons, and sandwiches.",
			"18. Some of the specialty menu items you can find at McDonald’s around the world: deep-fried cheese in Italy; McFalafel and McKebab in Israel; McSpaghetti with Chicken McNuggets on the side in the Philippines; cheese quiche in Brazil; and red bean pie in Hong Kong. Go crazy, world.",
			"19. A McDonald’s strawberry shake doesn’t actually contain any strawberries.",
			"20. The McDonald’s training program, dubbed Hamburger University, has graduated more than 80,000 students.",
			"9. 21. Newscaster Willard Scott was the first-ever Ronald McDonald. He invented the character and played him, before being fired for being too chubby.",
			"22. Mayor McCheese was only actually mayor of McDonaldland from between 1971 to 1985, and then he \"retired.\"",
			"23. McDonald’s was sued by the Krofft brothers, Sid and Marty Krofft, the creators of H.R. PufnStuf, who claimed that the characters of McDonaldland were way too similar to the Kroffts’ inventions. McDonald’s settled out of court in 1977.",
			"24. Some famous folks who’ve worked at Micky D’s: James Franco, Lin Manuel Miranda, Rachel McAdams, and Shania Twain.",
			"25. The Queen of England apparently owns a McDonald’s as part of her real estate holdings. How crazy is that?",
			"26. There are McDonald’s restaurants in 110 countries around the world, but franchises have been banned from Bermuda, Iceland, Bolivia, Montenegro, Kazakhstan, and Macedonia so stock up on Big Macs before you visit any of those spots.",
			"11. 27. Anthropomorphic purple blob Grimace was introduced as a mascot in 1971. He originally had four arms and was supposed to be an evil character who stole milkshakes from children. Rude.",
			"28. A short list of things people have found in McDonald’s food items: a needle, a piece of chewed gum, and a condom.",
			"29. The highest-calorie item on the menu is the 40-piece chicken McNuggets. They weigh in at 1,901 calories in total. Not that you’re gonna eat 40 chicken nuggets all by yourself...are you?"

			"Stephen Colbert has tried extremely hard to remain as neutral as he can be during the presidential election season. After years of mocking the right on The Colbert Report, his late night show has attempted to remain above the fray. But lately, the sheer lunacy of the Donald Trump campaign and the growing concern that this narcissistic, dangerous buffoon might have a shot of actually winning has clearly weighed heavily on the host.",
			"Oftentimes before taping his show, Colbert will hang out with his audience and take questions. Sometimes they are personal ones, like this beautiful story about how he met his wife , but occasionally they are political. Tonight, the question of Donald Trump and his relationship with Vladimir Putin came up and Colbert clearly couldn’t help himself. An unidentified woman in the audience asks him what he would ask Donald Trump if the Republican nominee ever dared show up on his program, and Colbert ad libbed a one line takedown for the ages.",
			"Well, we’re not broadcasting right now so I guess I’d say ‘What does Vladimir Putin’s d*ck taste like?’",
			"It brought the house down. It even managed to crack Colbert himself up.",
			"According to the Daily Beast’s Matt Wilstein, the joke killed so hard that the show’s writers and network execs are trying to figure out a way to throw it into the live show tonight.",
			"As ever with Trump’s searing comedy, there is an element of truth there. In the past week, the world has learned that Russia not only appears to have been responsible for hacking into the DNC’s private emails and releasing them to discredit Hillary Clinton, but that Donald Trump has uncomfortable ties to Putin. Things have only gotten worse for Trump after he gave a hastily arranged press conference with reporters that included to a message meant directly for Russia, encouraging the country to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails and release them . He even promised they would be \"rewarded\" for the effort.",
			"Russia, if you are listening. I hope you are able to find the 30K emails that are missing. You will be rewarded mightily by the press.",
			"The comments have led to outrage on the left, silence on the right, and condemnation from many of America’s more preeminent leaders of the intelligence community. It’s also led to one of Stephen Colbert’s greatest jokes ever."

			"These women spent three years counting how many words are spoken by women in the Bible"
		],
		"postPlatform": "Twitter",
		"targetParagraphs": [
			"There are 93 women who speak in the Bible, 49 of whom are named. These women speak a total of 14,056 words collectively -- roughly 1.1 percent of the total words in the holy book.",
			"These are the findings of the Rev. Lindsay Hardin Freeman, an Episcopal priest who three years ago embarked on an unprecedented project: to count all the words spoken by women in the Bible. With the help of three other women in her church community -- as well as highlighters, sticky notes and spreadsheets -- Freeman painstakingly dissected the Bible's New Revised Standard Version.",
			"\"I wanted to know what women in the Bible really said,\" Freeman told The Huffington Post. \"I was stunned to see that nobody had done this before.\"",
			"The women met in the basement of Trinity Episcopal Church in Excelsior, Minnesota, where Freeman served as rector at the time the project began. They worked to identify each woman who makes a speaking appearance in the Bible, how many words she utters and what her larger role is. Their efforts culminated in a final book, Bible Women: All Their Words and Why They Matter, which was published in September 2014.",
			"Some of the biblical women are prominent and well-known, like Jesus' mother, Mary, who utters just 191 words. Mary Magdalene says 61 words, while Sarah, the wife of Abraham, says 141. Many of the female characters in the Bible go through what Freeman called \"tremendous trauma,\" and have largely been silenced over the centuries.",
			"\"We have for whatever reason overlooked the witness of women in the Bible for all these thousands of years and all the contributions they've made to the faith and to world history,\" Freeman said. \"We are just finally finding out their stories.\"",
			"Freeman is also the author of The Scarlet Cord: Conversations With God's Chosen Women, which analyzed the stories of 12 women in the Bible.",
			"Greg Carey, a New Testament professor at Lancaster Theological Seminary, agreed with Freeman, and said her book performed \"a valuable service\" by elevating these women's stories.",
			"\"The Bible was written by men largely for men, and women's contributions are scattered pretty thinly through its pages,\" Carey told HuffPost. \"By bringing these women and their stories into one place, Freeman opens an opportunity for us to see them as a whole.\"",

			"is betteridge's law of headlines correct?",
			"Mats Linander",
			"2015-03-19 - New York",
			"Betteridge’s law of headlines famously asserts that any headline that end in a question mark can be answered by the word \"no\". This \"law\" is of course no law – creating a counter-example is trivial – but should rather be seen as a tongue-in-cheek remark on how poor journalism sometimes hides behind dubious headlines.",
			"In this post we’ll try to answer to what extent Betteridge’s law applies to current articles on the internet. Using the scripts in this repository , we have crawled 13 separate news sites for a total of 26000 headlines (2000 per site) and tried to answer the 766 of them that end in question mark.",
			"Headline polarity",
			"A polar question is a question for which the expected answer is either \"yes\" or \"no\". We find plenty of these among our 766 headlines, but also plenty of non-polar questions.",
			"Roughly 46% of the 766 headlines ending in question mark are non-polar. They are not yes-no questions, so the answer can’t be \"no\". As such, they contradict Betteridge’s law.",
			"Yes and no but also maybe",
			"Even though Betteridge’s law clearly doesn’t hold for all headlines, could it be that the remaining 54% all have the answer \"no\", thereby making the law mostly correct? We did another sweep through the polar headlines to find out.",
			"There are also a number of headlines that we failed to answer. For instance, the BBC asks if India is the next university superpower but does not define what \"university superpower\" means. It doesn’t seem impossible that India could become that, whatever it is, but we can’t really say if it’s more likely to happen than not. Hence, the answer to this, and to several other questions, will have to be \"maybe\".",
			"Among the \"maybes\" there’s a whole plethora of reasons why a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" wasn’t provided. In some cases, like above, we doubt anyone can really say. In other cases the answer is probably out there somewhere, but we failed to find it. And there are of course also various sports related questions that we couldn’t muster up the energy to research properly. Interested readers can check out the raw data set for a closer look.",
			"With 46% non-polar and 20% answered \"yes\", at least two thirds of our headline sample violates Betteridge’s law. We conclude that it cannot be \"mostly correct\" either.",
			"Conclusion",
			"We’re going to go out on a limb here and guesstimate that the remaining \"maybe\" answers can, given enough time and effort, be turned into \"yes\" or \"no\" answers, and that these will be distributed similarly to the 20:17 ratio of the fully answered headlines. That would put the total ratio of \"no\" at 25%.",
			"In other words, it appears as if roughly a quarter of all headlines which end in a question mark can be answered by the word no. You can go ahead and call that Linander’s law of headlines, if you will."

		"targetParagraphs": [
			"Nav Sarao made big money trading futures from his bedroom—then lost it all.",
			"It took Navinder Singh Sarao a long time to accept that he might have been scammed out of $50 million. Stuck in London’s Wandsworth prison, wracked with anxiety and unable to sleep, the realization dawned on the man dubbed the \"Flash Crash Trader\" as slowly as spring turned to summer outside the barred window of his jail cell. ",
			"The trauma of the past few weeks had been difficult to process. On April 20, 2015, the slight, doe-eyed 36-year-old had dozed off peacefully in the same suburban bedroom he’d slept in since he was a boy. The next day he was arrested and taken to a police station, where he was charged with 22 counts of fraud and market manipulation carrying a maximum sentence of 380 years.",
			"According to the U.S. government, the British day trader had made tens of millions of dollars using an illegal practice called spoofing, including, fatefully, on the morning of May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 1,000 points in minutes before bouncing back. The extent of Sarao’s culpability for the flash crash is fiercely contested, but the incident exposed the shaky foundations on which the hyper-fast, computer-dominated financial markets now rest.",
			"Sarao’s bail was set at 5.05 million pounds ($6.3 million). It was a hefty sum, but according to the accounts of his company, Nav Sarao Futures Limited, he’d earned 30 million pounds in the previous five years. Newspaper reports, in which Sarao was dubbed \"The Hound of Hounslow,\" speculated that he’d be back with his family in the shabby West London borough by the weekend. Instead, the nightmare got worse. ",
			"Where’s the money, Nav, his lawyers wanted to know. Sarao couldn’t make bail, they gradually learned, because the bulk of his wealth was tied up in investments and offshore trusts, each more complicated than the last. Days in Wandsworth prison, a Victorian-era fortress where Sarao was housed with sexual predators and violent offenders, turned into weeks.",
			"After four months of dead ends, his legal team struck a deal with the authorities: If the U.S. Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission agreed not to oppose a reduction in bail to 50,000 pounds, the firm would act as a bounty hunter, taking on responsibility for tracking down the missing millions on the condition that its fees be paid if it did. ",
			"They were going down a rabbit hole. A review of Sarao’s investments from 2005 to the present day, based on dozens of interviews and thousands of pages of documents, reveals another twist in an already remarkable story. Navinder Sarao, the trading savant accused of sabotaging the world’s financial markets from his bedroom, may himself have been the naïve victim of what his lawyers portray as a series of cons that stripped him of almost every cent he earned. ",
			"Sarao declined to comment for this article. His lawyer, Roger Burlingame of Kobre & Kim in London, told a U.S. judge in November that all of the defendant’s assets \"have been stolen.\" Sarao invested in ventures from which he, the law firm and the CFTC had been unable to recover the funds, Burlingame said. \"Basically, he has some extraordinary abilities with respect to pattern recognition and certain sorts of mathematical abilities, but he has some fairly severe social limitations.\"",
			"Sarao’s trading career started inauspiciously in 2002 at Futex, a fledgling outfit in an unglamorous office an hour from the City of London that housed wannabe traders in exchange for as much as 50 percent of their profit. In a roomful of recent college graduates and drifters, Sarao stood out from the pack.",
			"\"Nav was always going to be the kind of person that would be legendary in some way,\" Futex Chairman Paolo Rossi said in an interview with Bloomberg TV after Sarao’s arrest. He had \"the potential to be remembered as one of the world’s greatest traders.\"",
			"It wasn’t until Sarao left Futex in 2008 and struck out on his own that he started to make serious money. Public filings show his assets popped to 14.9 million pounds from 461,000 pounds in the 12 months ending in June 2009, long before he enlisted a programmer to build a system that authorities say was designed to cheat the market.",
			"Former colleagues talk about Sarao’s frugality—his scruffy clothes, his reluctance to spend money on cars and watches, his abstemious eating habits. He learned early at Futex that withdrawing cash ate into his bankroll and reduced the size of trades he could place. ",
			"That near-obsessive drive to hold on to as much of his wealth as possible can also be seen in the way he conducted his business affairs. Looking to minimize his tax bill, he was introduced by his accountant to John Dupont, a director at the London arm of an Isle of Man-based financial advisory firm called Montpelier Tax Consultants.",
			"Dupont, then in his mid-30s, was a high-energy salesman whose accent veered from upper class gent to Guy Ritchie cockney depending on who he was speaking with, a former employee recalls. Operating from an office on Cockspur Street in London’s West End, members of his team cold-called contractors, day traders and bankers and tried to enlist them in a range of plans to minimize their tax bills, documents seen by Bloomberg show.  ",
			"The aim was to identify loopholes before they were closed. One former Montpelier employee said he coaxed wavering customers to sign up by promising to pay their legal bills in the event of a clampdown by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. Everyone at the firm thought he was Alec Baldwin in \"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" the person said. ",
			"Self-employed traders were particularly good prospects because they were predisposed to high levels of risk. And Sarao, an absent-minded dreamer with an unerring gift for making money who wo
