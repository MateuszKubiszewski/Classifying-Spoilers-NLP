["This will soon be America's biggest economic problem. \"Businesses are having a more difficult time filling open job positions, which are near record highs,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said in a report. The institute's monthly report on private payrolls, out Wednesday, showed an increase of 179,000 in July. Economists had forecast a rise of 170,000, according to Bloomberg. The gain in June was revised up by 4,000, to 176,000. But the overall pace of job creation is slowing as the economy approaches full employment, which is a level where virtually all who are willing and able to work are employed. Some economists see a slowdown in the number of people businesses are hiring as the natural outcome of an unemployment rate as low as 4.8%, although weaker capital spending and lackluster earnings growth have raised separate concerns. \"As the labor market continues to tighten, small businesses may increasingly face challenges when it comes to offering wages that can compete with larger businesses,\" Ahu Yildirmaz, head of the ADP Research Institute, said in the release. Goods-producing companies lost 4,000 jobs, fewer than in June, as manufacturing employment increased. The construction industry lost 5,000 private payrolls. This data comes ahead of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' numbers on", "This GOP lawmaker does NOT approve of students wearing pro-gay shirts. Rep. Kevin Elmer (R-Nixa) reportedly tweeted Thursday: \"Nixa Schools failure. HS students working elementary school book fair in gay [T]-shirts.\" Attached to the tweet, which has since been deleted, was a picture of a teenage girl in a shirt featuring representations of gay and lesbian couples and the word \"HARMONY.\" The photo showed only the girl\u2019s torso, according to The Springfield News-Leader. Elmer had been at a book fair at his third-grade child\u2019s school when he saw several teens wearing the shirts. He told the Leader that he took issue with those garments being worn around young students, as he felt their message could interfere with his ability to parent on issues such as same-sex relationships. \"My wife and I know our kids better than anyone else and, when it\u2019s time to breach certain subjects to talk about certain areas, that should be up to us as parents,\" said Elmer, according to local outlet KY3. However, he said he is not opposed to students belonging to gay-straight alliances, called GSAs for short. \"The shirt itself is not offensive.

In Pokemon Go, incense is used to tempt Pokemon to the location of the trainer from their general location. Players are generally seen using incense whenever they are at home, work or any other place where they are unable to take a stroll in search of Pokemon. However, a Redditor called __isitin__ has discovered that the coding of Pokemon Go doesn\u2019t help the players much who uses incense without any movement. Generally, incense spawns a Pokemon every five minutes when the players are not making any movement. This spawning rate, however, can be increased to one per minute if the players manages to move 200 meters in between every spawn. At that rate, the players will need to cover one kilometer in five minutes to get the maximum out of the Incense. The players will actually need to jog at a speed of 12 kilometer per hour to meet this target. Although on paper they should be able to collect 30 Pokemon while travelling at this speed using incense, the server and the faulty tracking system of the game will reduce it to 10-15, which is also a good number. So, it is advisable for players not to use the incense", "This guy just won the 2014 Name of the Year contest. He totally deserves it:.

The point is that crackups come fairly regularly. And some of the prerequisites for the next one do seem to be falling into place. The International Monetary Fund may have gotten things about right in its annual Global Financial Stability Report, which was issued in October. It doesn\u2019t sound an alarm but expresses concern. Short-term risks have actually abated, the IMF says, pointing to rebounding commodity prices, which help some key emerging markets, and the prospect of easier money in developed markets. But, it says, \"medium-term risks continue to build.\" It cites the unsettled political climate, which makes entrenched problems harder to tackle; some weak financial institutions in developed markets; and heavy corporate debts in emerging markets. Risks that aren\u2019t acute can build for a while before triggering a crisis. What\u2019s indisputable is that debt, the tinder of almost every financial conflagration, is growing rapidly. At 225 percent of world gross domestic product, combined public and private debt outside the financial sector \"is currently at an all-time high,\" the IMF says.

Sawyer Fredericks!", "This is what makes employees happy -- and it's not their paycheck. A study by hiring software provider Cangrade revealed that being intellectually stimulated is the most important aspect of an employee's job satisfaction. Specially, those surveyed said intellectual stimulation accounts for 18.5 percent of their job satisfaction. That's compared to money, which accounts for just 5.4 percent of how happy an employee is with the job. Achievement and prestige, power and influence, work-life balance and affiliation and friendship were all rated more important to job satisfaction than money. \"These findings are quite surprising, because employers often assume things like income are the strongest drivers of happiness in the workplace,\" said Steve Lehr, Cangrade's chief science officer. \"In fact, our research shows that it may be the weakest.\" Researchers developed a three-part formula for employers who are eager to keep their staff happy: Try to ensure that jobs provide intellectual stimulation and task variety. Give employees some autonomy, influence and opportunities to acquire prestige and recognition. Employers should give employees these things even when they don't say they need them. Give them even more if they say they do. Employers should give all employees a break now and again, including the consummate workaholics who say they don't want or need it.

When accused of housing that garlicky stench, I tend to take offence and charge them with being ungrateful for me protecting them from vampires. But if that doesn\u2019t work, maybe you should try one of these scientifically proven odour eaters. Researchers from Ohio State University found that the best foods to banish garlic breath are raw apple and raw lettuce, the Huffington Post reports. Volunteers were asked to chew garlic cloves for 25 seconds before trying water; raw, juiced or heated apple; raw or heated lettuce; raw or juiced mint leaves; or green tea, immediately after. Heated lettuce sounds fucking grim. The researchers said foods deodorise garlic breath through two mechanisms \u2013 first, enzymes in the raw foods help to destroy the odours, and then, phenolic compounds in both the raw and cooked foods destroy the volatiles. Wikipedia They believe this is why raw foods were the most effective because they contain both the enzymes and the phenolic compounds. Although it didn\u2019t get rid of the volatiles, mint leaves were best at masking the smell. Plus, an apple a day keeps the odours away. To be honest, this has just made me really want to scoff a load of garlic bread", "Pulitzer Prize makes major change. In the past, publications that identified as magazines, either in print or online, were not allowed to compete for a Pulitzer in any category. But as an increasing number of Americans turn to digital media for their daily news, and many print magazines publish weekly and operate their own websites, the decision to broaden the spectrum makes sense. \"Pulitzer\u2019s aim was the progress and elevation of journalism,\" Pulitzer Prize administrator Mike Pride said in a statement. \"He envisioned that future generations would make changes in the Plan of Award for the prizes that are 'conducive to the public good or rendered advisable by public necessities, or by reason of change of time.' Increasingly, online and print magazines have expanded their mission. It\u2019s time to enlarge the tent again.\" While websites operated by broadcast news organizations remain ineligible, and the prize continues to be primarily focused on text, the Pulitzer Prize Board acknowledges that the web has provided new and compelling ways for journalists to integrate the written word with multimedia content. \"Consistent with its historical focus on text-based journalism, the Board will continue to place emphasis on the enduring value of words and of serious reporting,\" the press release read, \"while", "Why so many men are cooking. Today's at-home chefs are more likely to cook with an iPhone instead of a recipe book. They're more likely to draw their inspirations from a Facebook video.

Though the government has been hard at work to improve public transport around Manila, people need to start following traffic rules and regulations for any significant improvement to occur, Transportation Undersecretary Annelie Lontoc said in an interview on Monday, July 18. For starters, a more streamlined enforcement system is being tested on EDSA, Lontoc said. The government has divided the busy thoroughfare into 10 traffic zones, each with its own dedicated personnel from the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the Highway Patrol Group (HPG) to enforce traffic rules. Each of these zones will also have access to tow trucks, a quick response team on motorcycles, and personnel from the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to help with illegally parked cars and \"colorum\" (out-of-line) vehicles.

One of which was the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon-fiber reinforced plastics and other composite materials instead of the aluminum most commonly used on commercial airliners. While the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge, it's a decision that allowed Boeing to make a major change to its aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on its passengers. \"The Dreamliner has a composite fuselage and that allowed us to pressurize it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not as susceptible to fatigue,\" Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Business Insider in an interview.

For the study, researchers at McGill University and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute created a sleep education program to be taught in three elementary schools. The curriculum focused on using age-appropriate methods to teach healthy sleep habits and hygiene. For example, first and second graders were shown a video about a boy who sleeps in an overly stimulating room and loses sleep. Overall, 71 students between the ages of seven and 11 participated in weekly two-hour interactive classes for six weeks. At home, parents helped to measure student sleep by affixing a monitor on the non-dominant wrist at bedtime for four weeknights. Parents also gave researchers their children's report cards at the beginning and end of the program. At the end of the study, students slept, on average, 18.2 minutes longer a night than they did before going through the program. They also slept 2.3 percent better, overall. This translated into a significant improvement in mathematics and English grades, too.

With uplifting slogans such as \u2018You Are Actual Sunshine\u2019 and \u2018Yay You!\u2019, it seems there's no bad blood between Taylor and Calvin. Surprisingly this isn\u2019t Taylor\u2019s first venture into the world of greetings cards as the 26 year-old collaborated with American Greetings back in 2009. And Taylor revealed what first drew her to the industry in a press release at the time: 'My idea of a great song is a song that says how I feel better than I could. I feel the same way about greeting cards,' she said. 'I've always been fascinated by feelings and how we express them to each other.

The server was just for personal communication between her and Bill Clinton. She never sent classified information. And when the FBI opened an investigation into the server, Clinton called the FBI looking into server nothing but a \"security inquiry.\" FBI Director James Comey has responded to Clinton's comments, via Fox News. And she won't like what he has to say: But when asked Wednesday by Fox News about Clinton's characterization of the bureau's probe, FBI Director James Comey said he doesn\u2019t know what \"security inquiry\" means \u2014 adding, \"We\u2019re conducting an investigation. ...

Now comes news out of Baltimore that a black woman has allegedly been fired from her job because of her blonde highlights. Farryn Johnson told Maryland's CBS News affiliate that she was let go from her job as a waitress at Hooters due to '\"improper image\" after the 25-year-old refused to remove blonde highlights from her dark brown hair. \"They specifically said, 'Black women don't have blonde in their hair, so you need to take it out,'\" Johnson told CBS. \"I didn't see that it would be a big issue just because there were a lot of other employees working at the restaurant of other races with color in their hair.

Everyone used to know who America's Team was. These days, it's not as obvious. The Dallas Cowboys will never fully lose the lofty \"America's Team\" nickname, but the title has certainly not been earned in recent years. The Cowboys might make a load of money -- the franchise is the most valuable in the world, according to Forbes -- but that's where the relevance stops. Business is only half the game, at best, and in the modern media landscape, the product on the field matters more and more every year. Look at a franchise like the Golden State Warriors. Before Stephen Curry became the back-to-back MVP of the NBA, the Warriors were arguably the worst franchise in all of sports. The Chicago Blackhawks couldn't put 3,000 people in the United Center before 2008 -- now the Hawks are a cash cow that might as well have a national TV deal. Relevance comes cheap these days. Staying power is hard to maintain. Amid these truths, the Cowboys are testing fate -- they're a worse-than .500 team in recent years that is cashing in on its reputation from 20 years ago. Since 2010, the Cowboys have been 46-50, with three-straight 8-8 years from", "Donald Trump Appeared In A 2000 Playboy Softcore Porn. Donald Trump made an appearance in an explicit 2000 Playboy video. Trump\u2019s role in the porn is relatively benign and centers around him breaking a bottle of champagne on a Playboy-branded limo while several of the playmates are visiting New York City. BuzzFeed News obtained the footage from the online-only Buffalo, New York\u2013based video store Cinema Cornucopia. Other scenes from the film feature fully nude women posing in sexual positions, dancing naked, touching themselves while naked, touching each other sensually, rubbing honey on themselves, taking a bath, and dressing in costumes. The VHS cover of the video reads: \"From luxuriating in a warm, soapy tub, to reveling at an exclusive night club, Carol and Darlene bare their sex appeal and lead you on a sensual journey of discovery.\" On a bus tour hunt for the 2000 Playmate of the Year around the country, the Playmates travel to different cities including New York, Las Vegas, Chicago, Nashville, and San Diego.

Al Sharpton Silent. It was just another routine day in Mount Clemens, Mich., for Burkart, 22, who worked as a pizza delivery driver.

The orangutan was laughing at the wacky incongruity of seeing a chestnut in a cup and then finding it gone. Just like that! As Tommy Cooper would have said. It all begs the question: do animals really have a sense of humour? Or rather \u2014 because humans are animals \u2014 do non-human animals have a sense of humour? Or is humour actually a barrier that divides us from our closest animal relatives and from every other species?

Of all the beauty myths that never made a whole lot of sense, this old wives\u2019 tale probably takes the cake: if you pull out one gray hair, a bunch more will grow back. Once and for all, here\u2019s the truth. Not only is this weird saying totally false\u2013it\u2019s also biologically impossible. \"The hair follicle (the little tube beneath the skin that contains the root of the hair) only contains one hair,\" says Carly Bowers, expert for Latest-Hairstyles.com. \"Pulling out one gray hair won\u2019t cause two hairs to grow in its place; it will simply eliminate the hair until another one grows back in it\u2019s place.\" I\u2019m afraid there is a bit of bad news, however: if you happen to find a single gray hair, pulling it so you can get on with your life isn\u2019t a good solution. \"Plucking each hair will just cause them to grow back and they will grow back gray,\" says Dr. David E.

The truth is that Trump is not doing well. Even Trump\u2019s very best recent polls (which, by definition, are outliers that likely overstate his true level of support) show him receiving fewer votes than Republican candidates usually get. A recent CNN poll of Ohio , for example, that gave him a 5-point lead in the crucial swing state also shows him only getting 46 percent of the vote. Mitt Romney and John McCain both did better than that. Clinton\u2019s attacks and Trump\u2019s well-known weaknesses seem to have him losing the support of some GOP loyalists, even in his best polls. The problem is that Clinton herself is doing worse. Because despite her campaign\u2019s emphasis on Trump\u2019s weirdness and unpopularity, that isn\u2019t the only force shaping this race. It\u2019s profoundly unusual across two other dimensions \u2014 the strength of third party candidates and the weakness of the frontrunner \u2014 that will probably prevent Clinton from ever opening up a sustained comfortable lead unless she can do something to make herself better-liked.

It's hard to choose because the introvert/extrovert dichotomy reflects a tired and outdated view of personality. Personality traits exist along a continuum, and the vast majority of us aren't introverts or extroverts we fall somewhere in the middle. Personality consists of a stable set of preferences and tendencies through which we approach the world. Personality traits form at an early age and are fixed by early adulthood. Many important things about you change over the course of your lifetime, but your personality isn't one of them. Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it. Bruce Lee The continuum between introversion and extroversion captures one of the most important personality traits. It's troubling that we're encouraged to categorize ourselves one way or the other because there are critical strengths and weaknesses commonly associated with each type. Adam Grant at Wharton set out to study this phenomenon, and his findings are fascinating. First, he found that two-thirds of people don't strongly identify as introverts or extroverts.

A story he tells ahead about his directorial debut, \"Very Bad Things,\" pretty much illustrates exactly that: In the theater, he hears people laughing; outside, he sees a woman vomiting. The same man who directed the theatrical version of \"Friday Night Lights\" also directed \"Hancock\" and the aforementioned \"Battleship.\" Berg refers to his early directing style as \"creatively reckless.\" It might also be an apt phrase for his filmography. Berg's latest, \"Lone Survivor,\" is the true story of four Navy SEALs (played by Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch) ambushed by the Taliban in 2005. The film is based on a book by former SEAL Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg), and Berg makes \"Lone Survivor\" an almost overwhelming re-creation of those events. I met Berg at an Upper West Side hotel where we talked about \"Lone Survivor,\" his lingering disappointment with the box-office results for \"Battleship,\" and that poor woman who threw up at the premiere of \"Very Bad Things.\" This is an intense movie.

There are few pleasures in life greater than a deep, restful sleep. Seriously, if we could go back in time and tell our 5-year-old selves not to complain about nap time , we would.

For starters, melatonin is a For starters, melatonin is a hormone released by the brain that helps regulate the body's circadian rhythm (aka your internal clock), explains David Lee, MD, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the UCSF Fresno Medical Education Program. \"It's secreted by the pineal gland, which is at the base of the brain, and regulated by light,\" he says. \"It's a natural hormone that makes us sleep, and the moment the light goes away, like in the evening, that's when our peak melatonin [is produced].\" Are Melatonin Pills Really Safe?

How easy is it to declare a state of war? It really depends on the country, but in the Philippines it's as easy as inverting the colors on the nation's flag. Facebook learned this the hard way this weekend, when it published a bespoke banner to its Philippine users this weekend featuring the country's flag with the red part at the top and the blue part at the bottom. This signifies that the country is in a state of war, noted the Philippine Star, which spotted the blunder. The banner was designed as a celebration of Philippine Independence Day, making the snafu doubly awkward. \"Happy Independence Day! Here's to all of the Philippines' health, happiness and prosperity,\" the banner read. The majority of commenters asked Facebook to correct its mistake. \"This was unintentional, and we're sorry,\" said Facebook in a statement sent to the Star. \"We care deeply about the community in the Philippines and, in an attempt to connect people on Independence Day, we made a mistake.\" Facebook did not immediately respond to request for further comment.", "These races will determine whether Republicans hold their Senate majority.

The House will also remain in Republican control next year, after Democrats made only modest pickups there. While a couple of races were still outstanding as of 5:30 a.m. Wednesday, Republican wins in competitive states left no viable pathway for Senate Democrats to seize control from the GOP, despite earlier polling that suggested they were likely to do so.

But not all havers of dicks are lying: When a man has a length of 8 inches or more, it would suggest he has sufficient confidence in his size that he tells the truth.

If you\u2019re driving to impress with a lean retirement pocketbook, you might want to consider selling your vehicle for a low-cost-to-own model.

Amnesty International's Mariya Salim has worked on a report tracing the legal journey of the women and says there is a clear lack of will on the part of the administration to ensure they get justice. \"Research tells us that there have been only three convictions in rape cases during Hindu-Muslim communal riots since the country's partition, and that hasn't changed even now. We have seen delays at every stage\", Ms Salim says. The BBC's Divya Arya travelled to the area to listen to the women's stories.

The Coalition Mrs. Clinton can expect little if any opposition in the Democratic primaries. In the general election, she will need to win over the so-called Obama coalition of blacks and young, college-educated white voters who supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But she will also need to maintain her base of support among white working-class women while battling it out for college-educated women in the suburbs. White working-class men have drifted away from the Democratic Party, but Mrs. Clinton has appeal among those who still harbor warm feelings for Bill Clinton. Hispanics overwhelmingly supported Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Obama in the 2008 Democratic primaries, but overhauling the nation\u2019s immigration laws has become a more divisive issue since then, and some Hispanics wonder how committed Mrs. Clinton is to it.

In an op-ed published by The New York Times, Christopher Suprun, a paramedic in Texas, argued that the president-elect has demonstrated each day that \"he is not qualified for the office.\" Mr. Trump, Suprun wrote, has failed to unite the country as President George W. Bush did after 9/11. Instead, he has ranted and attacked the cast of NBC\u2019s \"Saturday Night Live.\" \"He tweets day and night, but waited two days to offer sympathy to the Ohio State community after an attack there. He does not encourage civil discourse, but chooses to stoke fear and create outrage,\" he wrote. \"This is unacceptable. For me, America is that shining city on a hill that Ronald Reagan envisioned. It has problems. It has challenges. These can be met and overcome just as our nation overcame Sept. 11.\" Suprun went on to say Mr. Trump \"lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief\" and lambasted him for how he \"urged violence against protesters at his rallies during the campaign.

These are the findings of the Rev. Lindsay Hardin Freeman, an Episcopal priest who three years ago embarked on an unprecedented project: to count all the words spoken by women in the Bible. With the help of three other women in her church community -- as well as highlighters, sticky notes and spreadsheets -- Freeman painstakingly dissected the Bible's New Revised Standard Version. \"I wanted to know what women in the Bible really said,\" Freeman told The Huffington Post. \"I was stunned to see that nobody had done this before.\" The women met in the basement of Trinity Episcopal Church in Excelsior, Minnesota, where Freeman served as rector at the time the project began. They worked to identify each woman who makes a speaking appearance in the Bible, how many words she utters and what her larger role is. Their efforts culminated in a final book, Bible Women: All Their Words and Why They Matter, which was published in September 2014. Some of the biblical women are prominent and well-known, like Jesus' mother, Mary, who utters just 191 words. Mary Magdalene says 61 words, while Sarah, the wife of Abraham, says 141.

Per Independent: Ten is the ideal number of lovers to have had for both men and women, researchers have claimed. More than 1,000 people took part in the online survey for Britain\u2019s biggest extra-marital dating site IllicitEncouters.com, being asked how many lovers they would want a new partner to have had. Between eight and 12 was the most popular answer, chosen by 38 per cent of women and 37 per cent of men. You see, what they have concluded is the ideal number of partners we want the person we are having sex with to have had, NOT the ideal number we want. There is a big difference there. Of course no one wants to have sex with some chick who\u2019s fucked all 53 guys on an NFL roster, so naturally this number is going to be substantially lower than our own hopes and dreams. The study even concluded that... Any number above 20 was considered a turn-off, chosen by 3 per cent of women and 4 per cent of men.

It is sweeter and cheaper than regular sugar and is in every processed food and sugar-sweetened drink. Purging it from your diet is the single best thing you can do for your health! In recent history, we've gone from 20 teaspoons of sugar per person per year to about 150 pounds of sugar per person per year. That's a half pound a day for every man, woman, and child in America. The average 20-ounce soda contains 15 teaspoons of sugar, all of it high fructose corn syrup. And when you eat sugar in those doses, it becomes a toxin. As part of the chemical process used to make high fructose corn syrup, the glucose and fructose -- which are naturally bound together -- become separated. This allows the fructose to mainline directly into your liver, which turns on a factory of fat production in your liver called lipogenesis.

HBO/Giphy At this point in the series, fans of both the show and the books know there\u2019s one major character who hasn\u2019t yet been introduced at all. Well, to be fair, there are lots of major characters who haven\u2019t (and won\u2019t) be introduced, this one is different. Her name is Lady Stoneheart and we already have met her. Sort of. Lady Stoneheart is the resurrected corpse of everybody\u2019s favorite Tully turned loving Stark, Catelyn. In the books, the brotherhood without banners takes the Lady\u2019s corpse (Thank you, Red Wedding) and brings it back to life (and we know from Arya\u2019s time with them that they totally have the capability to do it). Many fans of the books were surprised that the character hasn\u2019t yet shown up in the series since she has a major hand in the fates of other characters. There was some speculation that the show may just skip", "There's A Cheaper Alternative To The EpiPen - But Your Pharmacist Can Only Give It To You If You Do This. But does a decent, cheaper alternative exist? Yes, according to Consumer Reports. Here\u2019s how to try and get one. 1. Avoid asking for Teva's generic version of the EpiPen. It did not get approval from the Food and Drug Administration due to \"certain major deficiencies.\" 2. Do ask your doctor to write a prescription for \"generic Adrenaclick.\" While it is not the same delivery system, they do both contain epinephrine in equal dosages. You have to ask for this specifically. If your prescription says EpiPen, you can only be given an EpiPen. Unlike with other medications, your pharmacist cannot simply switch the cheaper generic. 3. Next, get a coupon from GoodRx to substaintially lower the $400 (without insurance) price tag. This could reduce costs to around $142. For those with insurance, the manufacturer offers a co-pay coupon to lower the price. 4. If the price is still much higher than that, ask your pharmacy about discounts. 5. Consult your pharmacist and read the instructions carefully \u2013 the device does not work in the same way as the EpiPen.

Being a fan of both Huy Fong's staple hot sauce\u2014and well, all beer\u2014I was eager to crack one. My initial thoughts? The bottle features an absolutely perfect version of the iconic sriracha rooster label, updated with Rogue's language. Get a bottle for your hot-sauce-loving friends, and they'll decorate their cubicles or man caves with it. Taste-wise, it's definitely drinkable. It's a rich stout with a tiny kick that hits you after the aftertaste. Would I order one in a bar? Um, if I saw \"Sriracha Beer\" on a menu anywhere, I'd order one in a heartbeat. Would I order a second one? Probably not. A session beer it is not. But it's a reasonable guess that Rogue doesn't think so either, given that the drink is only sold in single 750 ml bottles.

It was previously believed that Viola Davis, who plays Amanda Waller in the supervillains superhero flick, didn't receive any of Leto's infamous gifts he sent to the cast during filming. Turns out she did receive a box of bullets. \"It was a little worrisome,\" Davis said. \"It made you a little bit nervous and I'm pretty tough. You know I got into a few fights when I was growing up...but it scared me a little bit.\" As you probably have heard by now, Leto got so into playing The Joker that his gift giving also included a live rat, a dead hog, used condoms, anal beads and porn magazines. Davis finally came face-to-face with the Oscar winner out of character after Suicide Squad wrapped at a Glamour magazine event. \"Before that I was only introduced to The Joker...and I almost had my pepper spray out. You know, 'You remember that bullet you sent me?'\" Davis said. But the wackiness wasn't reserved solely for Leto. \"Every single person in it gets to be completely insane because all the characters are insane,\" Davis said. \"They're bad guys.

Click here for 12 new Disney World attractions opening in 2016. Walt Disney first built the park in 1971 as a supplement to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which the animation legend had opened 16 years earlier, on July 17, 1955. However, Orlando wasn\u2019t the initial location that Walt considered for his second park. Plans had actually been drawn up in 1963 for an indoor theme park that was to be built in downtown St. Louis. Click here for the best restaurants at Disneyland Park. At the time, it made a lot of sense. Research showed that only five percent of Disneyland\u2019s guests traveled from east of the Mississippi River, despite the fact that 75 percent of America\u2019s population lived on that side of the country \u2014 and Walt desperately wanted the extra business. When the plans were drawn up, St. Louis was booming, the landmark Gateway Arch in St. Louis was under construction (it debuted in 1965), and Busch Stadium (est. 1966) was being built just a few blocks away.

The rape and murder of Genovese in 1964 -- one of the most resilient tall tales in American crime history -- also led to the adoption of Good Samaritan laws in the United States. These laws protect bystanders who step in to help someone they believe is injured or in danger. Moseley, a psychopathic serial killer whose March 28 death was confirmed on Monday, didn't know Genovese when he stalked her out of a New York City bar where she worked on the night of March 13. He then repeatedly stabbed and raped her outside of her apartment complex. It took an hour for cops to respond as Genovese bled out, and she died on the way to the hospital. The attack garnered instant and widespread outrage, as officers on the scene erroneously stated that dozens of neighbors witnessed separate attacks on Genovese, yet did nothing to help her.

In studying 1,000 patients with stage 3 colon cancer who had all been treated with surgery and chemotherapy, Dr. Charles Fuchs, director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center at the Boston-based Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, found that patients had the greatest benefits from drinking four or more cups of coffee a day. The patients were 42 percent less likely to have their cancer return than those who did not drink coffee and were 34 percent less likely to die from cancer or any other cause, the study found. Meanwhile, patients who drank three cups of coffee or less had more modest results. Though the results are encouraging, the institute said Fuchs is hesitant make any recommendations about coffee consumption in colon cancer patients until the results are confirmed by other studies. \"If you are a coffee drinker and are being treated for colon cancer, don't stop,\" he said in a new release. \"But if you're not a coffee drinker and wondering whether to start, you should first discuss it with your physician.\" The study, which Fuchs said is the first to draw an association between caffeinated coffee and the risk of colon cancer recurrence, joins a number of recent studies that suggest coffee", "Former President Noynoy Aquino finds new line of work.

Findings from a study published in the Academy of Management Journal suggest that taking just a few minutes to reflect positively on the events of the day led to decreased stress -- and a healthier, more relaxed evening. Melissa Korn notes in the Wall Street Journal: It's no surprise that positive thinking can ease tension. But it might prove more practical than employers' current approaches for fighting workplace stress, such as offering flexible work arrangements or creating a new org chart that doesn't actually change daily life at the office, says Theresa Glomb, a work and organizations professor at University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management and co-author of the report. The experts at meQuilibrium teach that attempting to minimize or shrink stress isn't enough. You get stronger by flexing your attention muscle -- and controlling where it goes.

Jean began his answer by saying the team behind \"The Simpsons\" could never actually reveal that, but then continued with a hint that was more or less an admission. During a press conference call promoting the series\u2019 new season that began last Sunday, a reporter from MyNewYorkEye bluntly asked executive producer Al Jean, \"Where is Springfield? Do you want to tell which state Springfield is in?\" So by this point, with \"The Simpsons\" entering its 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery, any clue as to where the real Springfield is could be noteworthy. The Simpson family has resided in the American town of Springfield for nearly three decades. But despite millions of fellow Americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their \"Springfield\" actually is. The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family\u2019s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location.

The most important question to ask when you feel down Sometimes it doesn't feel like your brain wants you to be happy. You may feel guilty or shameful. Why? Believe it or not, guilt and shame activate the brain's reward center.

They found that the majority of the participants, who were from Brazil, Cameroon, the Czech Republic and Namibia, preferred medium sized breasts, followed by large sized breasts. And the firmer, the better. But the research paper states: However, a substantial portion of the participants selected either large or small size as their most preferred, indicating considerable inter- individual variation in breast size preferences. So, the study confirms what we already knew, really. Men like breasts. Large, medium or small? It doesn't matter - They just like breasts.  Did we really need a study to confirm that?", "And the world's most beloved landmark is... Various surveys consistently place Paris among the world's five most visited cities. But don't expect to see the Eiffel Tower -- or any other French landmark -- on TripAdvisor's most recent list of what it calls the World's Most Beloved Landmarks. You won't find the Statue of Liberty, Great Wall of China or Sydney Opera House on the list either.

That company was called Google and co-founders Larry Page, then 22 years old, and Sergey Brin, 21 (!), operated it out of a garage in Menlo Park. Today, most of us can't live without Google, and the now giant company is worth a mind-blowing sum: nearly $300 billion. Yes, Google is facing controversies over privacy and labor.

The settlement, which is expected to be for at least $700 million, would resolve several civil probes into the multibillion-dollar trading losses at the largest U.S. bank last year. Regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, are expected to be part of the settlement. The New York Times reported that the fines would top $900 million. The FCA and SEC declined to comment. However, U.S. prosecutors are still investigating JPMorgan for potential criminal wrongdoing. A settlement would mark a key step in JPMorgan's efforts to resolve its regulatory and legal troubles. The bank is facing separate probes by various government agencies into areas that include possible bribery in hiring practices in China and potentially fraudulent sales of mortgage securities. Following the \"Whale\" scandal, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon faced a bruising battle with some shareholders to retain his chairman title and has since been under pressure to improve the bank's relationship with regulators.

Researchers at North Carolina State University found that the number of people who supported a project on Kickstarter \u2014 rather than how much money the project raked in \u2014 was the real indicator of whether a product would succeed.  The study, published this month in the journal Research Policy, followed 1,000 successful Kickstarter campaigns in technology, product design, hardware and video games. All participants who responded raised at least $10,000 from an average of 1,078 backers.

For one, raising a lot more money didn't make founders any more likely to meet their goals for sales or profit once they entered the marketplace. That was because the difference in funding wasn't enough to help founders spend more on advertising or do anything else that would actually translate into more sales. Beyond that, raising extra money indicated that founders started to lose focus and stop innovating on bigger ideas.

It's the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song contest and the organisers have added a surprising wildcard in the form of Australia - a country not traditionally in Europe. Or factually. Or even metaphorically. But the contest has had a cult following Down Under (think how much we liked Neighbours and Prisoner Cell Block H) for many years and has been given a one-off invitation this year. An Australian jury panel will submit the Australian vote and Australia may well be televoting along with other European countries. This seems plausible as Australia has run its own online vote (which has no bearing on the competition) since 2010. And one of the Aussies' more successful musical exports (apart from Nick Cave, Kylie and INXS) is of course Bjorn Again - the wildly successful parody act which pays tribute to Eurovision's most famous winner, Abba.

According to a new study, some people with the so-called \"dark triad\" personality traits -- like narcissism and psychopathy -- keep their exes around for strategic, self serving reasons. Previous research and expert analysis suggests that individuals with dark personality traits like psychopathy engage in behaviors and relationships that are beneficial for their personal gain. Researchers from Oakland University wanted see if this theory also applied to connections with former partners. In the first part of their study, the researchers asked more than 300 participants to name reasons why they would want to be friends with an ex. Then, they narrowed these reasons down to seven concrete categories, such as \"reliability/sentimentality,\" \"pragmatism,\" and \"sexual access.\" The researchers assigned high scores to positive categories (like a former partner was \"reliable, trustworthy and of sentimental value\"), and lower scores to more negative categories (practicality and sexual access). Then, for the second experiment, they gave the list of seven categories to approximately 500 new participants, and asked each of them to rank the categories in order of personal importance to them. These new participants were also given clinical assessments that measured their prevalence of dark personality traits.

Soderlund also hinted that the single player campaign might be introduced in the sequel of the game.

The game scores 72 in the PC and PlayStation 4 versions and 75 on Xbox One version on Metacritic. He said, \"The one thing that we got criticized for was the lack of a single-player campaign.

As for our friends, they don\u2019t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us. One of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with. Our partners are no more self-aware. Naturally, we make a stab at trying to understand them. We visit their families. We look at their photos, we meet their college friends. All this contributes to a sense that we\u2019ve done", "Neil deGrasse Tyson says this is what you should invest in 'if you don't want to die poor'.

Sylvia Allen (R), would allow lawmakers to meet privately to negotiate and draft measures and would require them to have public debate only once a body takes an action, such as a vote. Arizona's current laws require that officials hold a public meeting any time a quorum discusses matters that could result in legal action. State Sen. Carlyle Begay (D), one of the bill's co-sponsors, told The Huffington Post that the state's requirements on open meetings make it extremely difficult for lawmakers who represent rural areas, where officials have to travel hours to be in the same room, to accomplish anything. That can make it hard for officials to deal with matters that need urgent and swift attention, Begay said. \"It's a way to update how our elected officials are able to converse to associate with elected officials they sit on boards with in a way that allows them to do their business, to advocate and represent the best interests of their communities a lot easier,\" Begay said. \"Right now it's a hardship for these officials because they have to post open meeting laws and post notice for simple discussions if they need to get", "Doctors were startled to find the cause of this 24-year-old\u2019s excruciating pain. The first attack struck while Dickson, then 23 and just back from a vacation in South Africa, was attending a party in New York. She assumed that the piercing abdominal pains might be a legacy of her trip or, more likely, the consequence of bad sushi she had consumed before the party. As the pain worsened, Dickson remembers wondering, \"Is this what childbirth is like?\" The next morning she saw her family doctor in New Jersey, who sent her to the hospital for tests. Soon afterward, the symptoms disappeared, and when testing revealed nothing, Dickson said she \"moved on.\" Six months later, she experienced a second episode, followed by another a year later. The third attack would end far differently than the first two: Doctors at a New Jersey hospital decided that, based on the results of her CT scan, Dickson needed emergency surgery. [Doctors dismissed his pain as migraines. Then they said he had 24 hours to live.] Johanna Dickson thought her excruciating stomach pains were caused by food poisoning at first.

Causes of bat wings Saggy arms often come out from nowhere! This problem is caused due to changes in the body throughout the adulthood. Arm fat occurs because of an excess fat in the body as a result of natural changes with the growing age. Age The age factor is the main cause of this issue. According to Dr. Megha Shah, Cosmetologist, Beauty and Curves Clinic, Surat \"After the age of 30, the body fat tendency increases and the lean muscle tendency normally decreases which leads to the encapsulation of fat.\" Change in Hormones In the recent years, the problem of batwings also emerges after the age of 20. This can also happen because of the hormonal changes as per the age or due to medical treatments that affect the hormones. Change in the hormones decreases the rate of metabolism which results in a reduction in the rate of calories burnt per day.It is obvious that a low-calorie burn leads to the deposition of fat. Lack of Physical Activities Because of lack of time, there is no physical activity which is the main reason behind the production of fat in the body including arms. Overweight This is another reason of batwings.", "Why Hollywood won't cast Sean William scott anymore. It seems like Scott got the memo, though.

In 2015, Scott starred in the independent dramedy Just Before I Go , a story about a man who goes to make amends with the people in his life after his wife leaves him with seemingly nothing to live for. Unfortunately, the limited release had few eyes on it, earning only about $8,000 at the box office, and most of the critics who screened it didn't much care for it.

If you're looking to make the most of those key hours before you hit the office, try out a few of these morning routines for yourself. 1. Set Your Alarm with Precision Why have a super-precise wake-up time? There's something psychological about being specific that tells your brain to pay attention - it's the same reason we do our company morning huddle at 10:55 each morning. I used to set my alarm for around 6:00am, changing the wake-up call by a few minutes forward or back every day and hitting snooze (a lot). Now I don't compromise: it's set for 5:55, and the specific routine is ingrained in my psyche, forcing me out of bed on time. 2.

Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report\u2019s authors warn. Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called \u2018superbugs\u2019 such as MRSA develop. Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further.

The Cato Institute has published a study that determines the likelihood of being killed by foreign-born terrorists. As you can see, there have been only three deaths in the US in the last 40 years attributed to terrorists who entered country as refugees. That\u2019s an average of 0.075 deaths per year, or a 1 in (roughly) 3.6 billion chance. As the study\u2019s author Alex Nowrasteh notes, these three deaths happened when Cuban refugees carried out an attack in the 1970s. The Refugee Act of 1980 strengthened refugee vetting, and not a single terrorism-related death since has been linked to refugees. So here\u2019s a short list of things that are more likely to kill you than a refugee if you live in the United States: 1. Cows According to the CDC, cows caused at least 108 deaths just between 2003\u20132007. That\u2019s about 21 deaths per year, roughly 288 times more than refugees. 2.

People magazine hammered that home on Tuesday when it published the names of six witnesses who said they were told some version of former People reporter Natasha Stoynoff\u2019s charge that in the middle of an interview, Trump pushed her up against a wall, \"forcing his tongue down my throat.\" At least one of these witnesses was told of the event the very day it happened, and others were told that same week. Some of the witnesses also validated Stoynoff\u2019s claim that she didn\u2019t come forward at the time of the incident, in 2005, because she feared retaliation. Since her story came out, Trump has said she is lying and suggested that she was too ugly for him to assault. Stoynoff\u2019s college friend Liza Herz says she was with Stoynoff when they bumped into Melania Trump the winter after the incident. \"What struck", "If You Zoom In On This Airport In Google Maps, You'll Get A Morbid Surprise. The airport is usually the last place you want to encounter any surprises. That goes double if you're talking about surprises of the morbid variety, but that's exactly what you'll see if you ever fly into the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport in Savannah, Georgia. Thanks to a decision by the military during World War II, one of the runways serves as a makeshift graveyard. If you have a keen eye and you're flying in on runway 10, you'll notice two concrete slabs that don't look like they belong there. Here's a close-up, courtesy of Google Maps. What you're actually seeing here are two concrete grave markers. Before there was an airport, the land belonged to the Dotson family. As it was part of their homestead, the property also included a family cemetery with at least a dozen (and possibly up to 100) graves. During World War II, the military took over what was once a small airport and expanded many of its runways. One of those extensions reached to where the family cemetery was located. The military needed to pave over the cemetery to create an east-west runway. Most of the bodies were unearthed and moved to different cemeteries, except for", "Surely THIS. #Richmond City Council unanimously approves resolution calling on Congress to investigate @POTUS #Trump business holdings. pic.twitter.com/sD3L0ZSVUr \u2014 Lilian Kim (@liliankim7) February 22, 2017 The text of the resolution was not immediately available, but the city council agenda listed \"a resolution in support of a Congressional investigation regarding the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump.\" The basis for Trump\u2019s impeachment, according to local ABC News affiliate KGO, would be the president\u2019s alleged links to his private business holdings. Critics have claimed that these create conflicts of interest, and possibly violate the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause. However, there is no evidence that Trump has benefited from conflicts of interest, or that he has done anything illegal to justify the \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" standard for impeachment. The Emoluments Clause argument is also thought by many constitutional scholars and legal analysts to be very weak. Donald Trump has been something of an obsession for Richmond politicians. In 2015, the mayor blamed Trump for inciting a hate crime against a local mosque, even though the suspect had praised Hillary Clinton in social media.

Here\u2019s How It Works. Smart businesses have caught on too. As Pokemon Go users traverse their towns in search of Pokemon, local stores, restaurants, movie theaters, and other businesses are capitalizing on this massive opportunity, driving huge amounts of foot traffic and conversions both with simple in-app purchases and creative marketing campaigns. To start turning the ambulating gamers around you into your new best customers, all you need is to know how to play the game. Here's how: 1. Find Out if Your Business Is a Gym or PokeStop What makes Pokemon Go different from many other games is that it doesn't keep people shut up in their rooms. The game runs off an augmented reality HUD, or heads-up display, of the real world. Players' avatars explore with them as they catch Pokemon, collect rewards from PokeStops, battle other users at Gyms, and team up to defend their territory. Figuring out whether your business is a PokeStop or Gym is the first thing you should do. PokeStops and Gyms attract foot traffic without any effort-players flock to them for rewards and to battle other players-and they can be leveraged for massive sales if you know how.

Pierre, though, thoroughly supports the first lady and, as he revealed in his first interview since Jan. 21, he\u2019s also incredibly grateful for the opportunity. Additionally, working with her has seemed to only help his career. \"I had no idea when I made the dress what the consequences would be,\" Pierre told Bazaar.com on his newfound celeb status. \"Immediately my phone went completely ballistic with interview requests; I had investors and bankers in Dubai calling, people opened fake Instagram accounts under my name.

As fun as it is to play Overwatch, sometimes players would prefer to kick back and watch their friends, streamers, or eSports figure in order to learn some new tricks, or just be amazed at what can be done in the game. Unfortunately, Blizzard doesn\u2019t make it easy to spectate someone else\u2019s game, so we\u2019re here to give you some tips on how you can watch others play Overwatch.

But Blizzard does make it possible to spectate in Overwatch, although it isn\u2019t as convenient as a dedicated spectator mode. One way to spectate a game is to attempt to join a game a friend is currently playing. If the game is full, you\u2019ll be forced to sit on the sidelines, but as a result, you can spectate your friend as well as all of the other players in the match.

For Big Think's #TuesdaysWithBill video series, someone asked if the government is hiding information about aliens from the public for fear it would disrupt our lives too much. So, your standard, run of the mill conspiracy theory, which Nye absolutely does not buy. Crazy story: In 1947, the U.S. government put balloons in the sky, because the Soviet Union was evil. Those balloons eventually fell down. They threw dummies out of the sky, too. Now, people think the balloon and the dummies were extraterrestrial life. Nye can explain it better. Also, he knew some guys who went to Area 51. Most Popular The moral of the story, though, is the government is terrible at keeping secrets, and aliens are no exception. So, there aren't any aliens strapped to testing equipment in Area 51 labs. You know where there are aliens? Out there. In space. Just last week, NASA discovered Proxima B, a new Earth-like planet, and according to Nye, scientists have plenty more in the works.

Then, it spits out answers to burning questions from brands and advertisers about the preferences of their target audiences when it comes to things like food, music and TV. For instance, as TechCrunch reports , Qloo can tell you the favorite music artists of fans of the Golden State Warriors vs. fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers. That's no small thing: it helps advertisers ensure they're marketing the right things to both groups, collectively or separately, based on what they do and don't share. (For instance, Warriors fans like Drake and Cavs fans like Li'l Wayne, but both groups like pizza and SportsCenter.)

If it's not online, you don't have proof that it happened. If you think of social media as the modern equivalent of a town square, the place where announcements are made and information is posted and communities are bonded over shared experiences, then it only makes sense that you'd be inclined to share the bits and pieces of your life that you perceive to be worthy of documenting. The point is to post the highlight reel. The concept is to share the parts of our lives that those who aren't immediately close to us otherwise wouldn't be able to see \u2014 and there is nothing wrong with this. Yet social media has an added layer of nuance, as it is a supplement (if not a projection) of our identity, connectedness, and self-worth. We can piece together an image of ourselves, quantify how loved and seen we are by others, and ultimately begin to gauge and compare where we stand socially. It should come as no surprise that we end up addicted to the thrill that all the clicks and pixels give us, as those things that social media", "Game of Thrones: Here's when HBO's hit show is going to end.

A new study has suggested women start losing their memory and the ability to think as quickly in their fifties, an age range earlier than previously thought.  Researchers from UCLA and Brandeis university studied over 2,000 women in their forties for 10 years after menopause and found their cognitive speed declined by five per cent over the ten year period. Their verbal episodic memory also declined by two per cent in the ten years. The women were measured every one to two years for an average of six and a half years.  \"Our results provide strong, longitudinal evidence of cognitive ageing in midlife women, with substantial with-woman declines in processing speed and memory,\" they wrote in the study published in PLOS ONE. The study found there was \"cognitive ageing in women in midlife, with significant longitudinal declines in both processing speed and verbal memory\".  The authors noted that previous studies have not consistently measured cognitive performance in those under 60 and said that following their results further research is needed to identify factors which could influence the decline rates and to develop interventions which could slow cognitive ageing.

The Official Method: Browser Extensions The official (and recommended) way to use Pushbullet on your desktop is via the browser, by way of a free Chrome extension or Firefox Add-on. The drawback here is that your browser needs to be running to catch and display notifications. This is not always practical, and the notifications you\u2019ll see are (by default) browser-based notifications and not native system ones. A neat workaround for Firefox users is to install the Pushbullet add-on and then enable the notify-osd extension we told you about recently \u2013 all Pushbullet notifications will then show up as native Ubuntu notifications.

They found that the women only ranked differently for two things: intelligence and faithfulness.

Have attitudes changed so much that people are not making negative judgments based on a woman\u2019s dress?

The Washington Office of Financial Management's assessment put state-wide use at 85 metric tons for 2013, but that estimate was based on federal data from 2008 and 2009. Time reports that the difference in the estimates \"very roughly\" amounts to the difference between about 25 and 50 joints per resident each year.

The antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body.

The alternative \u2013 clonal selection theory \u2013 says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction. The instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection .

In particular, they found that supersized portions can add more than 500 calories to each of our plates every day, which has only helped to make us fatter and fatter.  \"The message is that, however it happens, reducing the amounts of food that end up in front of us in the first place is key [to weight loss],\" says Gareth Hollands, PhD, senior research associate at Cambridge University School of Clinical Medicine and coauthor of the paper.

They also include rules that force people not to use any fake information or to have more than one account. Snapchat also forces people to tell it as soon as they change their number, despite a phone number not being anything like a central part of the app. It does give its users slightly longer to do so, requiring it in the first 72 hours of any alteration.

That means the closer the router is to the center of your home, the better off you\u2019ll be. Does that mean you have to install it in the guest bathroom? No, but if you can find a spot close by, you may improve the signal elsewhere in the house. If that requires moving wires, your service provider might be able to help. Likewise, if the router sits in a room with a closed door, open it. That\u2019s one less barrier to slow down the signal. Shift the receiver.

Scroll down for the step-by-step instructions on how to get this French braid hairstyle as seen on Chinese film star Zhang Yuqi. 1. For this look, it's best to start with day-old hair to achieve a better grip when braiding. You could also rough blow-dry hair to give it more texture. Soak up excess oil with a dry shampoo and wait a few minutes before you start styling. 2. Brush hair back and begin to braid, gathering strands from each side and working your way down. (Here's a video tutorial help you get it right.) 3. Secure the end of your French braid with an elastic ponytail holder and you're ready to head outdoors.", "Watch What Happens When 30 Pounds of Dry Ice Meet a Swimming Pool. The aptly named YouTube channel Crazy Russian Hacker is up to his crazy Russian hacking tricks yet again\u2014this time with an experiment apt for the arrival of summer: He combined about 30 pounds of dry ice with a beautiful hillside swimming pool. What we call dry ice is actually the solid form of carbon dioxide and, put simply, is extremely cold. The neat trick that frozen CO2 plays in normal atmospheric pressure is that it has the ability to skip over its liquid state and go from a solid directly into a gas. This process, called sublimation, happens at a very cold \u2212109.3 \u00b0F which, among other things, means that dry ice should never be handled with bare hands. You can actually see the Crazy Russian Hacker make this mistake a few times in the video as he reels from even the most brief contact with the dry ice. To speed its sublimation, and to trigger this awesome effect, chunks of the frozen CO2 are dropped into the swimming pool which causes quite the show. Plumes of carbon dioxide gas billow from the surface of the pool as the pieces appear to boil beneath the surface of the water. Some may", "A mother hears her dead son's heart beat.

It turns out that dogs can mirror their owners\u2019 personality, according to research published in journal PLOS ONE. More specifically, they pick up on their owner\u2019s anxiety and negativity. Researchers from Austria tested and observed 132 owners and their dogs. They asked the owners about their own, and their dog\u2019s, personalities, and the owner about their social attitudes to their dog and towards other humans. They filmed the dogs and their owners to observe their behaviour in one play session, and two threatening situations. They also measured their heart rate, and tested their stress hormone cortisol through their saliva. They found that owners and dogs influence each other\u2019s stress levels and coping mechanisms, with owners being more influential than their dogs. So the more anxious and neurotic a person, the more likely it is that their dog will be the same. The study states: Dogs are sensitive to their owners \u0301 emotional states, and emotional contagion between owners and dogs is possible. Thus, dogs may mirror the anxiety and negative expectations of neuroticistic owners.", "Dude learns the hard way not to gobble the excess cereal that falls on your shirt. \"TIFU by eating a crumb off of my shirt\" ... without looking down first.

She had been our collective anchor. My grandmother spoke five languages, so that she could communicate with all of her grandchildren, and knew exactly how everyone liked their tea. And everyone liked it differently, all with slightly different amounts of sugar. Upon receiving the unexpected phone call, a sleepless night (pierced by even more phone calls) led to a hazy 40 hours which was broken up by a taxi, two planes, a few chocolate bars, a muted airport greeting and another car journey. By the time I arrived in Calicut, at the house where I had spent my childhood, there were only a few hours left until the funeral. Someone made me a syrupy tea, which boosted my energy, and briefly, my mood. I made myself another two more.

Published in New Scientist magazine, the 2006 study was conducted by sexologist Anthony Bogaert, a Community Health Sciences chair and professor at Ontario's Brock University. His research led him to conclude that having more older brothers makes it more likely a man will be gay. Each older brother raises the odds of homosexuality by a third, potentially going from a 3 percent chance with the first son to a 6 percent chance with the fourth. Bogaert studied 944 gay and straight men, including some who were raised with non-biological male siblings, to pit prenatal against postnatal factors. His research, which reappeared in a Sept. 4 New Scientist article, ultimately determined that fraternal birth order seems to have a connection to sexual orientation. \"That means for each male gestation that occurs, something changes in a woman\u2019s body that makes her more likely to give birth to a gay son,\" as Brock University explains Bogaert's findings. An abstract from the study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, summarizes the research: Only biological older brothers, and not any other sibling characteristic, including nonbiological older brothers, predicted men\u2019s sexual orientation, regardless of the amount of time reared with these siblings.

The leaf uses a special silk material that makes it possible for chloroplasts to live and do their thing, and chloroplasts are where the magic of turning CO2 into oxygen happens. Chloroplasts become the engine of the leaves that only need CO2 and sunlight as 'fuel' to run, and emits oxygen as its 'waste.' The engine's process is called photosynthesis, and the chloroplasts of a leaf is where photosynthesis happens. The fact that these silky things can actually carry out the process of photosynthesis with such little effort is what makes them so incredible and useful.", "How much sex should you be having? In what might be welcome news for everyone exhausted from work and frazzled from kids, research suggests you don't have to get down every day to reap the rewards of sex, at least in terms of happiness and relationship closeness. \"I do think couples can end up feeling pressure to try to engage in sex as frequently as possible,\" said Amy Muise , a postdoctoral researcher studying sexual relationships at Dalhousie University in Canada. Once a week \"is maybe a more realistic goal to set than thinking you have to have sex everyday and that feels overwhelming and you avoid it,\" said Muise, who is lead author of the study, which was published in November in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. The study found that sex could boost happiness because it makes people feel more satisfied in their relationship, based on survey data from two separate cohorts, including 2,400 married couples in the U.S. National Survey of Families and Households. \"For people in relationships, their romantic relationship quality is one of the biggest predictors of their overall happiness,\" Muise said. \"Having sex more than once a week might not be enhancing that (relationship connection), although it is not bad.\"", "Eight reasons why kissing is so good for your health - from burning calories to slowing aging. But did you know it could also benefit your health? Kissing can also be a hormone releaser, a mini-workout and a mood relaxer. Scientists have proven that smooching can trigger a whole spectrum of physiological processes to boost your immunity and improve your connection with your partner. We take you through each one and explain just how beneficial a lip lock can be. 1. IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR TEETH According to dentist Dr Heidi Hausauer, kissing increases saliva flow. This in turn keeps the mouth, teeth and gums healthy by removing food particles. The extra saliva helps to wash bacteria off the teeth and reduce plaque buildup.

Therefore, exchanging saliva can introduce the body to new bacteria.

But this isn't the first time we've seen a usually brass Cowell show us his gentler side. For the past nine years, Cowell has been supporting Shooting Star CHASE, a UK hospice charity that offers its services free of charge, he told HELLO! back in March. \"Even if I didn't have what I have materially, I haven't got a sick child,\" Cowell told the magazine. \"I feel so much for the parents and what they go through.\"", "Mom Dies During Labor, But Then The Doctors See Something Strange \u2013 INCREDIBLE!

Erica\u2019s husband who worked in the same school called for help and she was rushed to the hospital. Sadly, Erica\u2019s heart had stopped beating when she collapsed. She was technically dead when she gave birth to Baby Elayna 3 weeks early. But fortunately, a miracle made her heart beat AGAIN. Later, it was discovered that Erica had a heart defect that went undetected, which caused her heart to stop. Erica believes that God was protecting her.

Written by Faye Lee Millie found out she was pregnant and she and her partner Lewis were completely thrilled. But when they got the results of the of her ultrasound they learned she would be having twins and it was a dream come true for them. Millie wasn\u2019t incredibly surprised as twins ran in her family so she was extremely proud to be passing on the tradition. However, as they were celebrating the wonderful news, the doctor came to them with information that would break their hearts. According to her doctor one of her unborn twins had a condition called anecephaly, which meant that the child would be unlikely to survive after being born and if it did, it wouldn\u2019t live for a long time. The condition causes a portion of the brain to be underdeveloped. So the parents prayed hard for their unborn child, that both twins would survive. Tragically, God took one of the twins and she died soon after the emergency C-section Millie underwent. A woman who was unfortunately clueless about what Millie had just gone through commented to Millie that \u2018You\u2019re so lucky you haven\u2019t got twins...\u2019 According to her doctor one of her unborn twins had", "Freddie Aguilar suggests solution to Torre de Manila 'photobombing'. MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Freddie Aguilar said that if he had it his way, he would just switch the Jose\u0301 Rizal monument and the carabao statue as a fix to what critics call the \"photobombing\" by the Torre de Manila condominium in Rizal Park's skyline. In an interview with TV 5, the singer, who claims to be up for a position in the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), was asked about the issue. \"Kung ako po ang masusunod \u2013 ito po ay personal na opinyon ko lang po \u2013 para wala nang gulo, pagpapalitin ko po yung puwesto ng kalabaw tsaka ni [Jose] Rizal.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan , Desiderio \u2014 who is also a visiting critic at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts \u2014 reveals that he was not only supportive of the rapper's artistic vision, but that he was happy with the end result. \"It's an extraordinary and bold and different move for Kanye West,\" he said. \"And what I would say is that it is the clearest indication of his overall intentions as a person utilizing the media and working within it. I was absolutely floored and incredibly flattered and incredibly happy to see the video, which I think is really beautiful.\" Desiderio also disclosed that he found a kindred creative spirit with West, whom he respects as an artist in his own right. \"I think he and I are on the same page and he knows that, I know that.

The data, compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), also indicate that approximately 9.3 million adults, or about 4 percent of those Americans ages 18 and up, experience \"serious mental illness\" \u2013 that is, their condition impedes day-to-day activities, such as going to work. This data does not diverge greatly from the last SAMHSA report, released in 2012, which found that 45.9 million American adults, 20 percent of this demographic, experienced mental illness at least once annually. (Though there is a 1.8 percent difference, the statistics do have margins of error, and methods of compiling them are often revised, so this dip does not necessarily mean there has been a long-term decline in mental illness.) The SAMHSA paper comes amid increasing scrutiny of the ability of America\u2019s health care system to handle issues of mental illness. For example, the American Mental Health Counselors Association released a study earlier this week claiming that adults with mental illness who live in those states electing against expanding Medicaid under Obamacare will be denied insurance. According to the study, care could be denied to up to 4 million patients. The SAMHSA study breaks down mental illness rates by state.

According to dentists, skipping the twice daily cleanse can lead to all sorts of health issues such as loose teeth, bleeding gums and even coronary heart disease.  Here, Dr Ken Harris of Riveredge Cosmetic Dentistry in the North East, Dr Sameer Patel, Clinical Director of elleven and Dr Adam Thorne of Harley Street Dental Studio, reveal what really happens when you skip brushing your teeth.  Bad breath: If you fall into the habit of not brushing your teeth and your tongue regularly, this can cause a build-up of plaque, a clear sticky film on your teeth, and bacteria. Aside from bad breath, not removing plaque can lead to decay, cavities in your teeth and irreparable damage to the tooth structure. If you don\u2019t brush your teeth then the bugs that live in your mouth will literally take over. It also means that food particles will remain in your mouth which can cause bacteria to grow and cause bad breath. Coronary heart disease: The toxins and bacteria in your mouth can get into your blood stream and connect themselves to the coronary arteries, causing a potential blockage, which could lead to a heart attack.

This freaky scorpion/wasp hybrid recently appeared in the home of  Reddit user Synnyr. After posting the photos, he found out that it was actually a scorpionfly. Even though they look terrifying, these insects are largely harmless and pose no danger to humans. However, they do have one rather unsettling habit. They have a real affinity for human flesh, but not in the way you might think. Turns out, scorpionflies actually feed on human corpses and even use them to lay their eggs inside. In fact, the practice is so common that forensic investigators in Texas look for scorpionflies to determine a person\u2019s time of death.

In 2007, a man was performing the song in San Mateo in the Philippines when a security guard loudly informed the singer that he was off-key. When man continued to croon, the guard pulled out a .38 caliber pistol and shot the performer in the chest, killing him. Freak occurrence? Nope. Since 2000, at least half a dozen people have been murdered after (or while) performing the Sinatra classic. Dubbed the \"\u2018My Way\u2019 Killings,\" the strange phenomenon has gotten so bad that some bar owners have removed it from the selection list entirely. Theories abound as to why this particular song seems to evoke such violence. It could be that the song is just so Sinatra that anyone else who sings it is bound to pale in comparison. It could be, according to singing school owner Butch Albarracin, that the lyrics inspire \"pride and arrogance in the singer, as if you\u2019re somebody when you\u2019re really nobody.\" Pop culture expert Roland Tolentino believes it\u2019s all about location\u2014these killings have all occurred in the Philippines. \"The Philippines is a very violent society, so karaoke only triggers what already exists here when certain social rules are broken,\" he said.

For example, the outlet reports that the company's warehouse employees are paid $14 an hour. \"Building culture is a money-saver over time,\" Huang told Quartz. He estimates about 10 percent of employees will take advantage of the wedding offer. So what if you don't want to get married or just aren't into the idea of a wedding?

At least 67 of them were serving life sentences, many of those for nonviolent drug crimes. The White House The White House points out that Obama has granted \"more commutations than the previous nine presidents combined and more commutations than any individual president in nearly a century.\" This is true, but it's also a slightly misleading statistic. When it comes to granting relief to people convicted of crimes, presidents typically have two options: They can commute a prisoner's sentence or they can pardon the prisoner completely.

That's what we call creative genius. But where does this improvisational ability come from? Charles Limb, a music-obsessed otolaryngologist and surgeon, wanted to know exactly that. Over the past few years, he's put jazz musicans and rappers into MRI machines to see what's happening in their brain as they freestyle and improvise. Results showed that when someone is creating something new, parts of the brain associated with self-expression (language and at times, especially while freestyle rapping, parts associated with visual imagery) are highly active. At the same time, and perhaps more interestingly, another part of the brain associated with inhibition quiets down. At a TEDx talk in 2010, he said it looks like it does this \"so that you're not inhibited, so that you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses\". Below is a graphic from Limb's studies that shows that while improvising, areas of the brain involved in self-monitoring \u2013 the sort of thing that might stop creativity \u2013 quiet down (those are blue); while areas of the brain connected to expression and language become very active (in red).

There were at least 60 journalists killed globally in connection to their work in 2014, according to an annual report from the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization that advocates for press freedom around the world. The latest death was Afghan cameraman Zubair Hatami, who died Saturday from injuries he sustained in a Taliban attack. Committee to Protect Journalists is still investigating whether the deaths of 18 journalists were related to their work. Reporters Without Borders recently cited 66 journalist killings in its 2014 survey. The difference likely results from each organization's methodology and the ongoing investigation of some cases. Syria, mired in civil war since 2011, ranked as the most dangerous country for journalists for the third year in a row. Seventeen journalists were killed in the war-torn country this year, bringing the total to 79 in the conflict. The organization found four journalists and three media workers killed covering the war in Gaza, five journalists in Iraq, and five journalists and two media workers in Ukraine.

Try this very simple way to save money  via @NBCNewsBETTER. Have extra cash? Put it in an envelope. In fact, put it in several. That's how \"Broke Millennial\" author Erin Lowry saved $500 in a year on a $25,000 salary. The theater major moved to New York City in her early 20s after landing a job as a page on the David Letterman Show. The aspiring actress' job was to entertain the audience before the show started. It was fun, she said, but paid little. \"I had a vision of a starving artist and it's almost this romanticized thing that kids do in college,\" Lowry told NBC BETTER. But Lowry soon realized her paycheck wasn't nearly enough to cover the $950 a month she owed in rent. To make up the difference, she picked up extra work as a Starbucks barista and babysitter, often working all three jobs in revolving shifts in a single day. \"It was a pretty tiring time in my life,\" said Lowry. But she was determined to make it work and save money in the process. Lowry got paid in cash whenever she babysat, and got tips working at Starbucks. Instead of putting the money in a bank account, she deposited into envelopes. She split her budget", "Scientists See Light From A Black Hole For The First Time. In the epitomizing blackness of space, few natural phenomena can compete with the darkness of black holes. After all, with their inexorable gravitational pull, nothing, not even light, can be seen ... right? Well, mostly. Last week, for the first time ever, scientists observed visible light emanating from beside a black hole with nothing more than a 20 cm. telescope. Apparently, the rather beautiful phenomena occurs when, as the Guardian explains , \"material from surrounding space falls into them and releases violent bursts of light.\" Essentially, when some matter is sucked into one of these massive pits of gravity, they emit an incredible amount of energy, which can manifest itself as light. When this happens, it looks like we\u2019re seeing light coming out of a black hole. Back in June of 2015 , a team of scientists led by Mariko Kimura of Kyoto University, became the first to ever see this sort of light through a telescope when a black hole named V404 Cygni, one of the closest to planet Earth, began showing activity after lying dormant for 26 years.

Iverson, 38, hasn't played in the NBA since February 2010, when he was on the 76ers roster. But the 6-foot dynamo has said time and again that he hoped to return to the league before his retirement.

Here, Rob Hobson, Head of Nutrition at Healthspan, busts common carb myths \u2013 and reveals the smart way to incorporate them into your diet... WHAT ACTUALLY ARE CARBOHYDRATES? Carbohydrates are the sugars, starches and fibres found in fruits, grains, vegetables and milk products \u2013 and they're our main source of energy. When it comes to sugars, there are two basic types. Intrinsic sugars are those found naturally in fruits, vegetables and milk. Extrinsic sugars are those found in table sugar, fruit juice and natural sweeteners such as honey, agave and maple syrup. These are broken down very quickly in the body, causing blood sugar spikes and troughs that can lead to energy slumps, cravings and fat storage. When you eat carbohydrate foods they increase blood sugar levels and the body releases a surge of insulin. This is a hormone that controls blood sugar by messaging muscle, liver and fat cells to take up glucose from the blood to be used for energy. When the body has enough glucose to meet its energy needs, what's left over goes to the", "This 256 Year Old Man Broke His Silence Before His Death... And Revealed An Incredible Secret.

The body that governs soccer, the most popular sport in the world, is a multibillion-dollar behemoth. Great power, yes. Great responsibility? Not so much, critics say.

With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see: Now Nintendo wants to unify them: Poke\u0301mon in Greater China will be officially called \u7cbe\u9748\u5bf6\u53ef\u5922, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Poke\u0301mon).

The House Passed It, Of Course. The EPA\u2019s October 2015 regulations lowered the limit for ground-level ozone pollution -- otherwise known as smog, which forms when nitrogen oxide reacts with volatile organic compounds in the air. The rules had been in the works for seven years, and even the updated standard was not low enough to please a number of public health and environmental groups. But business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argue that the new standard is too strict and will hurt industry. They scored a win with the House bill, sponsored by Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas), which would push back implementation of the rules by 10 years. Olson said in a statement that the bill is simply a \"common sense\" effort to provide \"needed flexibility so that states and localities can adequately achieve new, lower standards with time for compliance.\" Business advocates are understandably pleased. \"Manufacturers are encouraged to see House leaders pursue much-needed legislation to reduce the burdens and inflexibilities associated with the 2015 ozone standards,\" said Ross Eisenberg, NAM's vice president of energy and resources policy, in a statement.

A new study from the University of Washington\u2019s Foster School of Business found that despite working the same amount of time, a worker who starts the day earlier will come off as more conscientious, and consequently receive better performance reviews, than someone who starts later. Past studies have shown that giving workers a little leeway in setting their hours makes them happier and more productive -- presumably a win for both the employee and the company. That's why companies like Google and Microsoft let employees work from home or adjust their schedules to account for personal responsibilities, like taking a child to school in the morning. But the study suggests a downside: Your boss may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time, regardless of how much work you're getting done. In the study, which will be published in full in the Journal of Applied Psychology later this year, researchers asked 149 supervisors to rate an employee\u2019s performance; employee start times ranged from 5 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. Even when employees who started later in the day worked the same number of hours as those who started earlier, supervisors were inclined to rate employees who began work earlier", "U.S. airport tops Beijing for \"world's busiest\" title:.

In both the books and the films, the Patronus charm is one of the most powerful defense spells a witch or wizard can cast to ward off Dementors, the dark creatures that feed off human happiness. It's one of the most complex spells in the wizarding world, and in order to conjure a Patronus, a wizard needs to draw upon his most powerful happy memory. The Charm conjures a magical guardian in the shape of the animal with whom the witch or wizard shares the greatest affinity. Rowling's response may point to the fact that the spell is simply too difficult for Hagrid, who was expelled from Hogwarts as a teenager, to perform. But fans were also worried that the lovable half-giant, abandoned by his mother as a child, may just not have enough happy memories to produce a Patronus.

Artem Krechetnikov of BBC Russian examines the grisly murder of Rasputin and finds that some details are more myth than reality. Few characters in Russian history are as well-known as the mystic from Tobolsk in Siberia, whose name is forever linked to scandal. He has been called a \"sex machine\" and \"lover\" of the Tsarina, Alexandra Feodorovna. The first description is probably an exaggeration, and the second is simply false. Russians' opinions of him, at the time and later, ranged from \"holy man\" to \"reptile\". The latter was how the reformist prime minister of the time, Pyotr Stolypin, contemptuously spoke of him. With the outbreak of war in 1914 there was hysteria about \"dark forces around the throne\". The Empress Alexandra, wife of Tsar Nicholas II, believed Rasputin had mystical healing powers that could help her haemophiliac son Alexei, the heir to the throne. Supporters of Russia's alliance with France, keen to see Germany defeated militarily, suspected Rasputin of undermining Russia's foreign policy.

NASA has confirmed that New Orleans and the surrounding areas are sinking at a much higher rate than previously thought. Using airborne radar to map the rate at which the ground is sinking over a period of a few years, they were able to document in fine detail exactly which regions are most at risk, and where planning and building needs to be monitored. The Earth\u2019s surface can sink due to a mixture of natural and man-made causes. The weight of deposited sediment can, for example, cause subsidence, as can the movement of glaciers and the compaction of shallow sediments. But humans can also influence this process by pumping out oil and gas, or in the example of New Orleans, by the withdrawal of water. The extraction of groundwater and dewatering of the region, in which surface water is removed in order to prevent standing water or saturated earth, is causing the city to sink. This has been exasperated by the building of levees, which prevent the natural build-up of sediment that counteract the sinking. The region of Norco is one of the worst affected, sinking 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri This is most acute in regions upriver", "He Pokes Nails Into A Lemon.

But rather than a survival tip, this definitely makes for a fun experiment \u2013 as long as you exercise caution. NorthSurvival\u2019s video shows how inserting copper clips and zinc nails into a softened lemon, then connecting the clips and nails with wiring, can produce a short-circuit which will then start a fire, with the help of steel wool and kindling. If this feels reminiscent to a certain grade school science project, it should. The process used to start a fire with a lemon is essentially the same as the one that involves using a lemon to conduct electricity and power a light bulb or a battery. Bright Hub Engineering explains this is due to the copper and zinc creating a breakdown in the atomic structure of the electrodes within both metals and the lemon simultaneously, leading to the generation of a new flow of electrons in the lemon. Be careful: If you attempt this trick yourself, it is important that you use covered wiring like NorthSurvival does", "Sad and low? Well the Spice Girls might come back to spice up your life.

As a result of these outrageous prices, nearly one in five Americans cannot afford to fill their prescriptions. Meanwhile, the five largest prescription drug companies made a combined $50 billion in profits last year. That is unacceptable. A lifesaving product does no one any good if a patient cannot buy the medicine they need, and that is now happening far too often in the richest nation in the world. A new report out today from Americans for Tax Fairness explains how a pharmaceutical company, Gilead Sciences, games the system to charge high prices, shift profits offshore and avoid billions in U.S. taxes. Gilead sells a drug called Sovaldi, which is used to treat the hepatitis C virus. The drug was developed with taxpayer funds by a researcher who worked at the Department of Veterans Affairs and founded a small drug company. Gilead bought the company for $11 billion, acquired the government-provided monopoly rights and set the price at $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 per treatment in 2013. U.S. public and private insurers, taxpayers and patients spent more money on Sovaldi in 2014 than on any", "Huge news for Phish fans. \"Fuego\" will be Phish's 16th studio album. Last year, as a preview, Trey Anastasio told Rolling Stone that while making the record, the band \"created an atmosphere where it's just the four of us again.\" Drummer Jon Fishman echoed this sentiment in a press release. \"For years, there's been a distinct difference between how we did things live and how we did them in the studio,\" he said. \"But the way we go about things live, the way the musical ball is passed around, is now happening much more in the studio \u2013 not because we're trying to duplicate how we play on stage, just because this is how we operate as a band, period.\" As a teaser, Phish posted the album's eighth track, \"Waiting All Night,\" on YouTube. Slate already called it an \"ideal introduction\" for non die-hard fans. It's a breezy five-minute track that easily fits into Phish's 30-year catalog.", "Fast And Furious Add Bizarre New Cast Member For Eighth Film. The Fast and Furious franchise is never short of bad ass characters \u2013 and now they\u2019re adding one more. Dame Helen Mirren. We already know she\u2019s exceptionally untouchable when it comes to playing powerful roles. She\u2019s played a vixen-esque assassin in Red, an army colonel in Eye in the Sky (a role that was originally created for a man) and the Queen. She may be 70, but don\u2019t think for one send that Dame Helen Mirren is thinking of slowing down. Quite the opposite, actually. The venerable actress \u2013 one of Hollywood\u2019s sexiest if you ask me \u2013 has confirmed she will appear in the latest film in the Fast and Furious franchise, according to CNN. The news comes after Mirren proved she was even more bad ass, saying she\u2019d like a sleeve tattoo and would love to star in the Fast and Furious films. And it looks like the film\u2019s producers heard her. Mirren told Elle magazine: \"I said, \u2018I\u2019ll be in it, but only if I\u2019m allowed to drive if I do drive in it. But we\u2019ll see.

In the last seven years in which the S&P 500 rose in each of the first three quarters, only in one of them \u2014 2007 \u2014 did the index drop in the fourth. Actually, when one looks at the entire performance history of the S&P 500 going back to 1928 (which is available despite the fact that the index was technically created in 1957) one finds that out of the 19 years in which the market rose in the first, second and third quarters, a negative fourth quarter only followed five times. In these 19 years, the S&P's median performance was a 4.1 percent gain, according to a CNBC analysis of FactSet data. That 74 percent \"win rate\" and impressive median gain for fourth quarters following three consecutive winning quarters compares to a 62 percent win rate for the S&P over all of its 355 quarters, and average quarterly performance of a 2.5 percent gain.

Nearly a month after the launch of the health insurance exchanges that are central to Obama's health care reform law, the HealthCare.gov website and the information technology behind it continue to pose problems to consumers and health insurance companies alike. On Friday, health care entrepreneur and Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients, who is overseeing a so-called tech surge to repair the site, for the first time offered a concrete timeline for the project. \"By the end of November, HealthCare.gov will work smoothly for the vast majority of users,\" Zients said during a conference call with reporters. \"The bottom line is the performance of the system has been unacceptable,\" Zients said, echoing an assessment Obama offered Monday. \"We're executing a plan of attack and the system is getting better.\" At its worst, HealthCare.gov only allowed three out of 10 users to get all the way through the application for financial assistance, he said. \"The HealthCare.gov site is fixable. It'll take a lot of work and there are a lot of problems that need to be addressed,\" he said. Zients is a former official at the White House Office of Management and Budget and will become director of the White House National Economic Council", "What exactly is half and half? Of course, the two halves in half and half aren't mysterious at all. Half and half is simply half whole milk and half cream. In the UK, they call it half cream. According The Kitchn, half and half typically has a 10 to 12 percent fat content, which, it stands to reason, means it's less fatty than cream and fattier than milk. You don't need to wait for your morning coffee for this all to make sense. Half and half isn't just for coffee, either. It's great for cooking, whether you want something creamy but not too heavy, or when your recipes call for both milk and cream. The Kitchn suggests you use half and half for ice cream, chocolate ganache, scrambled eggs, or cream sauce. If you add half and half to a deglazed pan, you'll end up with a rich and flavorful sauce for everything from pasta to chicken. Finally, The Kitchen suggests using half and half for White Russians, if drinking a glass full of cream with your vodka doesn't really appeal. You can add it to oatmeal, whip it into mashed potatoes, and even make a cre\u0300me bru\u0302le\u0301e with half and half.

The Oxford City Council is adding the gender inclusive option Mx to all its official forms alongside Miss, Ms, Mrs and Mr. The decision, made following a recommendation by the council's executive board, forms part of the council's \"ongoing work to be as inclusive as possible\", according to a council report. \"The council\u2019s workforce has been changing to look more like the diverse communities that it serves. Good policies have helped to bring this about and tackle discrimination but further improvements are possible,\" said Councillor Tom Hayes, the vice-chair of the group's Scrutiny Committee, said in a statement. Hayes also noted that the council is taking steps to build a workplace that's \"friendlier\" to transgender, gender non-conforming and non-binary employees and that gathering personal information is \"central\" to that. Oxford City Council isn't alone in taking steps to make its forms more inclusive. Brighton & Hove City Council sent a letter to thousands of parents in April this year asking them to support the gender their children \"most identify with\" when confirming school places. The letter asked that parents help their children complete a form and to leave the gender section of the form blank if their child is non-binary.

This theory sounded crazy \u2014 I had to look into it \u2014 but when I got back to work, I couldn't find the documentary. I wondered whether I had entered some type of twilight zone (cruise ships have pretty strange channels). But my parents saw it too \u2014 we couldn't have all imagined the same thing. At first glance, I thought it was the 2014 BBC documentary \"Hitler's Hidden Drug Habit: Secret History.\" But I watched the whole thing, and the filmmakers made no mention of this wild can't-get-drugs suicide theory. To be clear, though: Yes, Hitler was very, very into drugs. Variousscholarshaveoutlinedhisextensivesubstanceuse.

Emmanuel Nahshon, a foreign ministry spokesman, confirmed to Al Jazeera on Sunday that Israel had agreed to the visit in principle, though the \"when and how\" were still under discussion. The ICC's move comes as human rights groups have harshly criticised Israel for closing investigations into dozens of allegations that its military has broken the laws of war during an attack on Gaza in the summer of 2014. The Hague prosecutors are reportedly interested in examining how effective Israel's legal mechanisms are in investigating allegations of war crimes. Under the terms of its founding statute, the ICC could take over jurisdiction of such probes if it is persuaded that Israel is unable or unwilling to conduct credible investigations itself. So far, only three Israeli soldiers have been indicted on a relatively minor charge - of looting - even though Israel's 51-day offensive , named Protective Edge, in July and August 2014 resulted in some 2,250 Palestinian deaths. The vast majority were civilians, including 551 children. \" We have seen Israel conducting flawed investigations or dragging out the legal process with long delays.

Case in point: A ravenous bear broke into a Lyons, Colorado, bakery and ate 24 pies, as well as several bags of ingredients. The mischievous bear entered the Colorado Cherry Company by breaking through a window and climbing onto the oven, where he proceeded to eat two dozen pies as well as \"bags of cocoa and a bag of sugar,\" the owner's daughter Mikaela Lehnert told The Guardian . While it sounds as if the bear was indiscriminate in his tastes, he actually had quite the discerning palate. \"He went for the apple and the cherry and left behind the strawberry rhubarb, so he was a picky little guy,\" Lehnert said. The morning after the pie raid, Lehnert and her mother arrived to find their store in shambles, with two boxes in the yard. And, with 24 pies devoured without a trace, they have reason to believe that the bear enjoyed his dining experience \u2013 and may return. \"We have a feeling he knows it's here so he's going to come back,\" Lehnert said.

Research reveals that people who are drawn to bitter-tasting drinks are more likely to be narcissistic and sadistic. Could your favourite boozy treat say something about your personality? The study was led by Professor Christina Sagioglou from Innsbruck University in Austria and involved almost 1,000 test subjects. Findings suggested that people who opted for stronger, sharper flavours were more likely to experience a \"thrill\" when they felt discomfort. The strong flavour of gin could give drinkers a rush of adrenaline Professor Sagioglou explained that the sensation can be \"compared to a rollercoaster ride, where people enjoy things that induce fear\". First, the participants were asked to rank a list of sweet, salty and sour foods on a six point scale ranging from \u2018dislike strongly\u2019 to \u2018like strongly\u2019. After registering their taste preferences, subjects were given four different personality tests that measured aggression, selfishness, psychopathy and narcissism. During the testing, participants were asked to give assessments on statements such as: \"Given enough provocation, I may hit someone\" and \"I enjoy tormenting people\". They were also questioned about extroversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and emotional stability.

A more interesting question, a question that perhaps you\u2019ve never considered before, is what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?

With the calendar moving to February comes the opportunity to reflect on progression toward our goals for 2017. But how many people looked back in December and actually kept their 2016 New Year's resolutions? Very few.  But that doesn't mean it can't be done. It just means that people need to be mentally stronger and more resolute to hit those goals, especially their wealth goals.  Here are 6 financial habits of mentally strong people you can follow so that you can realize your money resolutions this year. They Maintain a Positive Outlook Toward Their Finances My attitude has always been, if you fall flat on your face, at least you're moving forward. All you have to do is get back up and try again. - Richard Branson Mentally strong people subscribe to Branson's notion that a positive attitude puts them in a position of control over their circumstances. They also apply this same principle toward their finances. In fact, research has shown that positivity is a hallmark of nearly all financially well-off individuals. You can follow in their footsteps too. Start by affirming out loud your financial goals for 2017. Remember, be specific and confident (for example, I will", "Here's What Actually Happens When You Swallow Your Gum. Nyul / Getty Images / Via thinkstockphotos.com \"Your GI tract is very strong \u2014 if it can digest a tough steak, it can digest gum,\" says Ganjhu. So you have the strong gastric movements and the acids and enzymes to break the gum down. The only difference is that the base of gum doesn\u2019t get dissolved completely because of its chemical properties, and also the contents don\u2019t get absorbed into the small intestine like most foods, says Ganjhu. \"Once it\u2019s in, it\u2019ll go out like everything else.

Katie Ledecky proved once again she is the best female Olympic swimmer of our time on Tuesday night when she won gold in the women\u2019s 200-meter freestyle at the Summer Olympics in Rio. She finished the race in 1:53.73, edging out Sweden\u2019s Sarah Sjostrom, who won silver with a time of 1:54.08. \"I did come pretty close to throwing up during that last 50,\" Ledecky said after the race. \"I knew I just needed to get my hand on the wall and be done. Everything was hurting. ... I just had to dig deep and do my own thing. I had no idea whether I touched first. ... I was done when I touched the wall. I knew I\u2019d given it everything I had to.\" [Michael Phelps extends his legacy with two more gold medals at Rio Olympics] Up next for Ledecky is the 800-meter freestyle. If she wins gold, Ledecky will join Debbie Meyer (1968) as just the second female in Olympics history to win three individual freestyle gold medals in the same Games. But Ledecky could do something even more extraordinary: break the eight-minute mark, a feat that, up until this point, has been seen only in the men\u2019s", "Was There a Corrupt Heroin Ring Inside the Prison Richard Matt and David Sweat Escaped From? Now that the nightmare search for escaped murderers Richard Matt and David Sweat has come to an end, New York's inspector general, state police, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are all looking closely at the prison they busted out of. On Tuesday, state officials announced that nine security officers and three members of Clinton Correctional Facility's executive team\u2014including Prison Superintendent Steven Racette\u2014have been placed on paid administrative leave, according to the Albany Times Union. That's not exactly a stunner given the sexually charged cooperation the escapees allegedly received from staff. But federal law enforcement sources told CNN Monday that the FBI is looking into the possibility that some kind of drug-trafficking ring was operating at the terrifying facility in Dannemora, New York. If any of the probes produce evidence of large-scale corruption at the prison, it would go a long way toward explaining just how Matt and Sweat made their daring escape on June 6. We already know that Joyce Mitchell, a 51-year-old civilian tailor at the prison, has been charged with putting tools into hamburger meat and smuggling them into the prison. Along the way, she seems to have involved a possibly unwitting corrections officer named Gene Palmer, who's", "Here's What to Do If You're Afraid of Losing Your Child in a Crowd.

A new \"world's largest hotel\" is due to open in 2017. Find out where:. That room count would make the hotel, scheduled to open in 2017, the world's largest (CNN) Twelve towers, 10,000 rooms and 70 restaurants, plus helipads and a full-size convention center: That's the plan for Abraj Kudai, a complex in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, that's set to become the world's largest hotel by room count when it opens in 2017. Designed by architectural firm Dar Al-Handasah , the $3.5 billion site is currently under construction and will stretch across 1.4 million square meters.

According to Bourdain, we should all stop buying knife sets. In his 2000 memoir, Kitchen Confidential, he says medium-size utility knives advertised on TV are \"hard to sharpen\" and \"ineptly designed.\" We'll also add that they tend to be quite expensive. His solution? \"Please believe me, here's all you will ever need in the knife department: One good chefs knife, as large as is comfortable for your hand.\" But which one should you buy? Instead of investing in an expensive Henkel or Wusthof knife that requires maintenance that's not realistic for an amateur chef, he recommends opting for a lightweight and inexpensive vanadium steel Global design. Then, to use this tool for all of your slicing needs, he says to use the tip for small stuff and the area near the heel for larger stuff. The only downside: Purging your knife collection means you won't be able to enlist as many sous chefs to help you tackle chopping for your vegetable tray the next time you entertain. Maybe this is a case for holding onto a few smaller blades, just to be safe. [h/t Business Insider]", "Is There Really a Connection With Bras and Breast Cancer? Controversial findings have been made that at least associate excessive bra wear to non-malignant breast fibrocystic disease as well as malignant breast cancer. Some assert there is a definite link. Ironically, it was an American woman who invented the bra around the turn of the 20th Century. Up until the beginning of the 20th Century, corsets are what made women exhibit that desired hourglass figure and inadvertently pushed up the bust line for fashionable clothing of that time. Problem was, corsets messed with internal organs while shaping those hourglass figures, and their tightness resulted in women fainting easily and often. The Birth of the Bra In 1893, Marie Tucek made a \"breast supporter\" that looked like a modern brassiere. But a little later Mary Phelps Jacobs designed a better version and called it a brassiere. She patented it and sold the patent to a company named Warner Brothers Corset Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut for $1,500. It caught on. By the 1950s, teenage girls were urged to buy and use training bras to hold their breasts firmly in a desirable way and prevent sagging. But even the brassier industry admits that the only time bras prevent sagging is while wearing them. It\u2019s", "Why some Starbucks baristas cover the logo on the cup.

From pork fat in roast chicken bites to sugar containing traces of bones, these are the most alarming examples of when innocuous-soundings products contain very surprising additions.  BEEF OR PORK IN YOGHURT Many yoghurts, especially low-fat yoghurts such as Muller Light, contain gelatine.  Gelatine is of course made from skin, tendons, ligaments and bones of pigs and cows which are boiled in water, according to PETA. It is rich in collagen and commonly used as a gelling agent in desserts, dips, yogurts, sweets and marshmallows.  If you're Jewish, Muslim or vegetarian, you may want to read the label much more closely next time you go to pick up a yoghurt.

Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment's own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\" The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies.

In an effort to combat illegal interstate drug trafficking, Denver International Airport has announced that it intends to ban marijuana possession on all airport property beginning in early January, The Denver Post reported. DIA is the first city facility to prohibit marijuana possession. Flying with marijuana, even medical marijuana, is prohibited by the Transportation Security Administration, DIA spokeswoman Stacey Stegman told the newspaper. Although Colorado voters approved recreational pot in 2012, the substance remains prohibited under federal law. Adults in Colorado can possess up to an ounce of marijuana legally, residents can purchase up to 1 ounce of retail marijuana, while tourists can purchase up to a quarter-ounce at a time. And all of that marijuana will have to be consumed or remain in the state. On New Years Day, dispensaries in Colorado will begin to sell recreational marijuana to adults 21-and-over for the first time in U.S. history. As the marijuana laws in Denver and the rest of the state continue to evolve, the Denver city government has launched a website which aims to educate pot consumers on the do's and don'ts of legal weed. The website offers additional rules and information for residents, visitors, marijuana dispensaries, parents, business owners", "The Elder Scrolls 6 Confirmed by Todd Howard, But There\u2019s Bad News For Fans. There were a lot of big announcements and reveals in Bethesda\u2019s E3 2016 press conference. It also announced a brand new Quake game during the press conference. Despite all this, one thing that the fans missed during the press conference was the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6. Most of the fans expected the game to be announced during the event owing to the fact that Skyrim protagonist Dragonborn\u2019s image was featured in Bethesda\u2019s E3 promo images. However, even though the game was not announced during the event, Bethesda boss Todd Howard confirmed that the game is in works in his own special way. Speaking to Geoff Keighley during a \"Youtube Live at E3\" interview, Howard let the cat out of the bag: It\u2019s good in these moments to tell our fans, \u2018Yes, of course we are [making The Elder Scrolls 6].

It seems the \"S\" has appeared throughout all of North America, South America, Europe, Russia, Asia, and Australia. Some people think it's a 90s thing; others report seeing it as early as the 1960s. There were theories that it was the symbol of some 80s hair-metal band. Other people thought it was the original emblem for the clothing brand Stussy. Others thought it was an incarnation of the Superman logo. No one was sure. I thought I'd ask the office. \"That's the Superman 'S,'\" mused Ben, our in-house graphics guy. I asked him if that meant it was actually from Superman, but he said it wasn't. \"No, I think it's just what kids think when they're drawing it.

The one notable thing that Tebow has going for him is that his last playoff win came in 2011.
