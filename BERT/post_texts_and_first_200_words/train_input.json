The daughter of Morton's The Steakhouse founder Arnie Morton, she was practically raised in the restaurant industry. She wasn't even 30 years old when, in 1989, she opened a popular restaurant called Mirador in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood. Mirador was celebrated by food critics and diners alike -- so much so that the restaurant and its connected lounge, The Blue Room, were frequently packed. But it wasn't long before Morton realized that something was missing. \"We'd have the busiest days [at Mirador], and I'd look out at the dining room and sit there and just feel empty,\" Morton told The Huffington Post. \"I was not a terribly pleasant person. I was really rough on people and had the shortest fuse and lost my temper. I didn't like who that was. I was not happy.\" One day, somebody knocked on Mirador's door and asked to buy the space. Morton knew she'd found her way out. The restaurant closed in 1993, and she decided to start over. Though she continued to work in the restaurant industry as a way to pay the bills -- she founded her own consulting firm and later worked as director of operations for a restaurant group -- her", "George Clooney's ex-gf will kick your ass in a sports bra thank you very much.

Still, Grazer\u2019s original vision for Splash was never realized, which is something that the possible reboot would address.

Garlic can be used to help lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure, and prevent cancer, heart attacks, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis. This superfood can also be used to help treat the common cold, the flu, bug bites, fungal infections, and traveller\u2019s diarrhoea. Garlic is great for strengthening your immune system while eliminating toxins, leading many people to consume it after chemotherapy. But while I love cooked garlic, garlic in its raw form is apparently how you\u2019re going to get the best results. This is because heating garlic has been shown to reduce its anticancer properties and inactivate a key enzyme called alliinase. What you\u2019ll want to do to maximise the health benefits of garlic is to crush it up raw, releasing the enzymes that will break down into good organosulfur compounds, and then eat it on an empty stomach. But raw garlic is incredibly pungent, so try this... Take 2-3 garlic cloves, chop up and crush them, and mix it with a tablespoon of honey (also healthy with anti-bacterial properties!). If you can consume it this way on a regular basis, it can go a long way in boosting your immune system!", "He Places Colored Water in Bread Pans Outside During a Snowstorm. What he Makes is Stunning!

It's a beautiful manufacturing process to watch, but because of the way the Eames Molded Shell Chair is finished, you never actually see the design of the skeleton underneath. The Carbon Fiber Eames Sofa, from architect and designer Matthew Strong, is an attempt to reveal that gorgeous inner structure. Woven together with threads of threads of ultra-strong, reinforced polymer, the Sofa shows off the Eames skeleton by stripping away the skin. Although the Eameses never designed a sofa in the style of their fiberglass shell armchairs, they did design prototypes sometime in the 1950s, which are still on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Because of the amount of fiberglass needed to make the Eames Sofa sturdy enough to hold multiple sitters, Herman Miller ultimately decided not to manufacture the product. The finished sofa was just too heavy. But if the Eames had access to modern materials, such as carbon fiber, the Eames Sofa may well have become a reality. Which is what makes Matthew Strong's sculptural carbon fiber skeleton of the Eames Sofa such a fascinating project in its own right: looking at it is like peering into an alternate timeline of Eames-era design.", "Why Does Salt Kill Slugs? The answer, in a word, is osmosis: the process that occurs when a solution meets a permeable membrane. A solution is a homogenous mixture of two (or more) substances where one substance, the solute, is dissolved in the other, the solvent. When you have a solution on both sides of a permeable membrane, the solvent tends to pass through the membrane to whichever side has more solute so that concentration on both sides is evened out. That\u2019s osmosis. A slug has quite a bit of water inside of it, and the cells that make up its skin have highly permeable membranes. When you sprinkle salt on a slug, it mixes with the water in the mucus that the slug secretes to help it move around, creating a salt-water solution. That solution has a higher salt concentration than the inside of the slug, so osmosis occurs and water from the slug\u2019s skin cells passes through the membranes to dilute the solution and even things out. If you use enough salt, the slug will lose so much water that it dehydrates, dies, and winds up looking pretty shriveled. Humans can handle salt without the same thing happening because our skin isn\u2019t as permeable", "29 amazing McDonald\u2019s facts that\u2019ll totally surprise you. 1.

The researchers did MRI scans of men\u2019s brains while showing them a mixture of sexually explicit images and non-sexual imagery. Their research was published May 28 in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. \"Our findings indicated that gray matter volume of the right caudate of the striatum is smaller with higher pornography use,\" the researchers wrote in the journal article, referring to an area of the brain associated with reward processing and motivation. Men who watched more porn also showed less activity in another area of the striatum, called the left putamen, which usually lights up in response to sexual images. Heavy porn consumers also had a weaker connection between the striatum and the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with decision-making. \"Dysfunction of this circuitry has been related to inappropriate behavioral choices, such as drug seeking, regardless of the potential negative outcome,\" the researchers wrote in the article. Yikes. So does that mean porn can really shrink guys' brains? Not necessarily, the researchers say. \"It's not clear, for example, whether watching porn leads", "Amber Tamblyn sums up the messiness of breastfeeding in one photo.

There isn't a definitive reason as to why some of us cry more than the average person, but experts point to a range of factors including gender and whether a person may have experienced trauma in their past. Men are predisposed to avoid crying, since doing so can interfere with the way peers perceive them. And while it's true that some women are more prone to waterworks during that time of the month, other factors that may come into play include birth control pills and hormonal fluctuations that can occur around menopause. Of course it's also no surprise that if you're bogged down at work and aren't getting enough sleep, that can also play into why your tear ducts are working in overdrive. The solution? Make sure you're getting eight hours of sleep at night and try meditation or yoga to bring stress levels down. But even if you do end up weeping a little too often, don't fret. According to a Health.com article, \"past studies have found that crying can have soothing, mood-boosting effects.\" If your crying is becoming a persistent problem though, talk to your doctor as it may be a sign of depression.

It's tough being different Taliyah is a control mage who functions similarly in playstyle to champions like Viktor and Anivia. Control mages are renowned for creating zones that aggressively influence the positioning of their opponents while outputting high damage and utility. Because of this, control mages offer unique playstyles that make for some of the most interesting champion designs within League of Legends. Although control mages may not be the most technical characters in terms of mechanics, they do require a great deal of strategy to make use of their abilities and create game-winning plays. They usually rely on positioning and landing slow but powerful skillshots which cost a great deal of mana and are often easy to dodge if used carelessly. These factors require the player to set up, predict and manipulate their opponents into areas where their skillshots can be landed successfully. Taliyah is a pretty unique control mage in the sense that she lacks a lot of the damage and burst that we are used to seeing from champions like Viktor. As compensation she has slightly more utility, giving her opportunities to create plays for her team if her skills are used properly.

Insider whether she thought Cyrus' risque VMAs performance and \"Wrecking Ball\" video were setting the feminist movement back. The icon and activist answered with a resounding \"I don't think so.\" She expanded on that opinion, saying: I wish we didn\u2019t have to be nude to be noticed ... But given the game as it exists, women make decisions. For instance, the Miss America contest is in all of its states ... the single greatest source of scholarship money for women in the United States. If a contest based only on appearance was the single greatest source of scholarship money for men, we would be saying, \"This is why China wins.\" You know? It\u2019s ridiculous. But that\u2019s the way the culture is. I think that we need to change the culture, not blame the people that are playing the only game that exists. We're glad that Steinem sees the complex context of Cyrus' manufactured sexuality, and didn't resort to shaming the 20-year-old pop star. But we're even more glad to see Steinem's comment as the last word on the matter.", "Why Jared Leto Failed Us In Suicide Squad. Over the many years that have passed since that fateful overturning of Finger\u2019s creative decision, the Joker has appeared to us in many incarnations and iterations, the most notable of them being Heath Ledger\u2019s interpretation of the character in 2008\u2019s The Dark Knight. Now, with the release of David Ayer\u2019s Suicide Squad, musician-turned-actor Jared Leto attempts to fill Ledger\u2019s impossibly big shoes by adding new fervor and new flavor to the role. However, while Leto\u2019s tatted-up take on Batman\u2019s greatest adversary displays a level of commitment that\u2019s as refreshing as it is terrifying, it fails to captivate and convince. He won\u2019t stick with viewers the way Ledger did (and does), but he will cement himself as one of the most fascinatingly miscast versions of the character to ever grace the silver screen. And even if that\u2019s not what we wanted, it\u2019s still worth discussing. Sadly, of all the actors who\u2019ve taken the dive into the character\u2019s perversion, Leto\u2019s hollow, hateful Joker may be the weakest portrayal we\u2019ve seen yet. It\u2019s a steep dive, to be sure, one that requires the performer to consider the darkest corners of the human psyche and operate from that darkness with unmistakable aplomb. It\u2019s unfortunate, then,", "Is this image proof of beer on MARS? An eagle-eyed Mars 'anomaly hunter' has spotted a strange object that looks like a green bottle in Nasa rover imagery. The bizarre bottle shape appears to have a red, green and white label and even a cork or cap at the end. Scroll down for video  Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. It is a form of apophenia, when people see patterns in random, unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places. On the red planet, one of the most famous is the 'face on Mars' spotted by one of the Viking orbiters in 1976. This was later proven to just be a chance alignment of shifting sand dunes.   The pictures were taken by Nasa's Spirit rover during a mission on the surface of Mars in November 2007. Vigilante Mars 'anomaly hunter' Thomas Miller, 64, spotted the strange shape while he was sifting through Curiosity's latest snaps of the red planet.

Mooncop Is a Requiem For a Forgotten Future Despite the jokes\u2014and it is a very funny book\u2014 Mooncop has a particular melancholy to it, reflecting its creator\u2019s feeling about the way scientific exploration has fallen out of favor with the general public. \"When I look back at the years of the Space Race it feels as though there was such an optimistic wonder about space, the moon, and generally about how technology would improve everyone\u2019s life,\" Gauld explains. \"Amazing things are still happening in science, but I feel there isn\u2019t the same unreserved positivity about it.\" The Idea for Mooncop Came from a Wonderfully Unlikely Place While the title suggests a police force on some Blade Runner -esque off-world outpost, the actual physical inspiration for Mooncop was far more quaint. \"The idea of a cop on the moon came from a 1960s tin toy I saw, which was a car with \u2018Space Patrol\u2019 on the side and a robot driver in a glass dome wielding a laser cannon,\" Gauld says. \"The packaging showed the car on a deserted moon, with the Earth in the black sky above.

Strong, who joined \"SNL\" as a featured performer last season, will co-anchor the mock news segment with Meyers at first, and is expected to fully take over the desk at some point. (Michaels told the Times that he would prefer for Meyers to continue doing Weekend Update even after taking over \"Late Night,\" but is currently unsure how that will play out.) This season will mark Meyers' eighth season on Weekend Update, which he joined in 2006 as Amy Poehler's co-anchor. Strong has previously made her mark on Weekend Update with her popular character \"The Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started a Conversation with at a Party.\" Previously, Meyers gave Strong special praise in an interview with Jimmy Fallon, saying that Strong's \"natural ability has kind of blown everybody away.\" He tweeted a joke about Strong transitioning from a character to a co-anchor: As for The Girl", "How distance brought an end to an NBA power couple that withstood conflicts of interest and professional trials:. \"I think the Lakers are trying to move away from that kind of stuff,\" Jackson said as we spoke briefly outside the Knicks' locker room on Dec. 11. There was such a distance in the way he said, \"The Lakers.\" This, after all, is the man who won five NBA titles in Los Angeles and was still engaged to Lakers president Jeanie Buss. But that distance was real, and it had kept growing as the years went by and Jackson spent more and more time in New York, running the Knicks, and in Montana with his children and grandchildren during the offseason. His connection with Los Angeles, and his fiance\u0301e, was simply too hard to maintain. On Tuesday night, Buss and Jackson announced that they were mutually ending their four-year engagement. The announcement -- via their personal Twitter accounts -- brought an end to the NBA's version of Camelot. Like the Camelot in Richard Burton's Broadway musical, this had always been an impossible romance. The owner's daughter dating the team's coach? And not just any owner: only one of the most powerful owners of all time, Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss. And not just any coach: only the most successful NBA", "The secret to 93-year-old Betty White's eternal youth. \"When you're as blessed as I am with the good health I have, that's the bottom line,\" White tells Oprah in the above video. \"I never take it for granted. I appreciate it more than I can say.\" Though the actress credits good genes as the main cause behind her strong health, White also cites a rather unusual exercise routine as another factor. \"I have a two-story house and a very bad memory,\" she says. \"So I'm up and down those stairs all the time!\" On a serious note, Oprah mentions that White never caved into the pressure of the rather common Hollywood practice of lying about her age. \"There was no need to,\" she says simply. \"What's the point of trying to fool anybody? Besides, my mother always said, 'Don't lie about your age. You'll forget and you'll slip up, and then you'll look ridiculous.'\" As the years went on, White's career began to evolve. Then, in 2010, a new generation of fans started to take notice.

The study, reported in the Daily Mail, tracked eye movements of men while they looked at women wearing red lipstick, pink lipstick, or no lipstick at all. Women in crimson garnered a lingering 7.3 second gaze, while those going au naturale got 2.2 seconds. But red lipstick is about more than just getting noticed. It instantly brightens the face and can actually make you feel more confident, as one HuffPost blogger recently noted. Still, the thought of drawing attention to your lips might be intimidating for some. But with the proper application and formulation, red lips can be worn at any age. More mature women may want to stick to a creamier formula and use a primer to prevent any bleeding or feathering. And as always, less is always more, especially when it comes to makeup. When wearing a red lip, keep the rest of your makeup light to make sure your lips stand out.

Gallup found that Americans who saw the debate believed Clinton was the runaway victor, 61 percent to Trump\u2019s 27 percent. That 34-point advantage is one of the highest margins post-debate since the 1960s. Clinton\u2019s debate victory was about as strong as her husband\u2019s in his first 1996 debate with Bob Dole, but fell short of Mitt Romney\u2019s first 2012 debate over President Obama, where the Republican nominee had a 52-point advantage. Historically, however, winning a first debate doesn\u2019t necessarily augur victory at the polls. President Obama overtook Romney in the following two debates in 2012, and while John Kerry was believed to be the clear winner of all three presidential debates, George W. Bush still won the election in 2004. Clinton\u2019s popularity post-debate was boosted by her support among those in her own party. Ninety-two percent of Democrats said she did a better job than Trump, while only 53 percent of Republicans believed Trump came out the winner.

But before you start feasting, you might want to know WTF they are, anyway. Soft-shell crabs are not a separate species of crab. They\u2019re regular crabs -- in the U.S. they\u2019re most typically blue crabs -- that have gotten too big for their shells. In order to keep on growing, they shed their shell and make new, bigger ones. In other words, they molt, and it is this molting process that makes soft-shell crabs such a treat. In order to shed its shell, the crab forms an inner soft shell underneath, swells its body with water to break its current shell, slowly crawls out -- this can take 10 minutes alone -- and then begins the process of forming a new shell. It takes a couple of days for a new shell to fully harden. That's when we want to catch them. The molting process looks a little like this. (You can watch the whole 8-minute video here).

Authorities in Nepal halted climbing for a while, but favorable weather conditions allowed teams to attempt to conquer the mountain again this year. Also attempting to climb Everest is Chad Jukes, another combat amputee working for another veterans support organization. Both Jukes and Linville took on the more difficult northern route out of Tibet, with Linville reaching the summit first and making history.

Sources tell Radar Online that Sony bosses are desperate to keep Daniel in the picture for a further two films, in order to 'phase in a younger long-term successor'. Murmurs have been circulating Hollywood for some time suggesting Daniel's replacement is imminent, with many insiders tipping the likes of Idris Elba or Tom Hiddleston to nab the iconic role.

Which is great until you realize that 85 percent of the building will probably be ridiculously expensive and probably populated by local tech bros.

One of the best ways to keep your One of the best ways to keep your brain sharp as you get older may be to stay busy, according to new research. While scientists have previously recommended engaging in mentally challenging activities , a new study suggests that keeping a packed schedule may offer similar benefits. In a survey of over 300 people participating in the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study, study authors found that among adults over the age of 50, having a busy schedule was associated with better brain processing, improved memory, sharper reasoning and better vocabulary. People in the study ranged from 50 to 89 years old, and the positive effect of busyness on the brain was consistent across age. This, the study authors conclude, suggests that keeping a busy lifestyle is important in middle age as well as old age. It\u2019s possible that staying busy increases people\u2019s ability to learn new things, as they may be exposed to different situations, people, and information on a daily basis, the researchers suggest.

Ava, who has had 14 surgeries, got to hang with the players last week, received a signed helmet and all kinds of goodies and attended the team's game on Dec. 21. It was all arranged through the Touchdown Dreams children's charity run by Fox Sports reporter Jay Glazer. But Watson went the extra yard -- well, way beyond that. He pulled Ava's father aside and told him he was donating a week's paycheck to the family. Just how much money is that? Well, given Watson's $622,948 salary for this season, his weekly paycheck for the 17-week season comes out to almost $37,000 before taxes, according to Pro Football Talk. \"With federal and California taxes consuming roughly half of that amount, the net check would have been in the range of $18,000,\" the outlet went on to note. On Sunday, Watson didn't tweet about the donation, though he did mention the Raiders' upset victory over the Buffalo Bills. (He did not play.) With Ava in attendance, the Raiders triumphed, 26-24. Fans deluged his account with", "Wow! This Company Pays For Employees' Weddings And Their Kids' College. There\u2019s now a new company making waves for introducing some pretty amazing perks. Boxed, an online Costco-like retailer, just announced that the company will pay for employee weddings (up to $20,000). This was in addition to last year\u2019s announcement that the company would cover the costs for employees\u2019 kids to attend college. Oh and on top of these two crazy perks, all employees get unlimited sick and vacation time. What makes the announcement so great is that unlike some tech companies that provide great perks for already highly paid people in Silicon Valley, the majority of the 125 employees at Boxed are paid hourly and handle shipping and fulfillment. So these types of perks really are life-changing for their employees. Boxed CEO Chieh Huang told The Huffington Post that \"Free snacks get old, I just want to do the stuff that really matters.\" He went on to add that real things like weddings and college are much more important than snacks and ping pong tables. They are also hiring for a wide range of jobs right now.", "You Won't Believe How Many Eyeliners Kim Kardashian Uses to Get a Natural Makeup Look. That's right. In the latest beauty tutorial on her app/website, Kardashian and makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic share the secrets of her \"natural daytime\" makeup, which includes filling in her brows, subtly shading her creases with the Urban Decay Naked Palette, and curling/lacquering her lashes. While all of that is pretty standard for a polished daytime makeup scheme, here's where the three liners come in. First, Dedivanovic gets in there with a kohl liner (MAC Eye Kohl in Smolder), working from the outside in and nestling the color down into the lashes; he gently pulls up on the lid to help get the liner down in there. Then he traces over that line using a liquid eyeliner, adding winged-out corners (he uses MAC Liquid Liner in Boot Black). The third liner is for the bottom lid, where he uses the Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil in Smog to add a smidge of gold inside the waterline to enhance Kardashian's brown eyes. \"Just very close to the lash line\u2014I don't want it to be too thick,\" he notes.", "A cup of coffee will cost you $8 in this city. An annual report by global consultancy firm Mercer has declared Hong Kong as the world's most expensive city for expatriates to live in. The survey of 209 cities took into account the cost of scores of items in each destination, including housing, food and entertainment. Mercer found that an unfurnished two-bedroom apartment in a decent neighborhood of Hong Kong rented for over $6,800 a month, compared to roughly $4,600 in London and just $4,000 in Tokyo. A cup of coffee cost nearly $8 in Hong Kong \u2014 twice as much as London ($4.40) and Tokyo ($4.00) respectively. Making up the rest of the world's top five costliest places to live were the Angolan capital Luanda, Switzerland's Zurich and Hong Kong's fellow Asian metropolises Singapore and Tokyo. They were followed by Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which broke into the top 10 for the first time. Shanghai, Geneva, Chad's capital N'Djamena and Beijing completed the upper tier. Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, was also deemed the world's least affordable city in a survey in January.", "You're going to have to wait longer than you thought for 'Game of Thrones' Season 7. HBO has announced that the upcoming seventh season of the drama will not return until summer 2017, as opposed to the typical April start day. Additionally, the show will have only seven episodes next season (past seasons have had 10 each). Production will be based in Northern Ireland, while additional portions will be filmed in Spain and Iceland. \"Now that winter has arrived on Game of Thrones, executive producers David Benioff and D.B.

At this point, a large dog -- presumably Stella -- bounds into view, runs to one end of the fence and jumps right over it, almost without effort. There is a perfectly timed comedic pause, then the man says, \"Dammit.\" In the comments section of the video, the original poster explains why he thought the fence would be high enough to contain Stella: \"Before I made the fence, I had Stella jump a baby gate inside and when she stopped jumping it I added six inches (15.2 centimeters).\" In a classic 'blame the dog' moment he adds, \"She set me up!\" What did the man eventually do with the useless fence?

Abilify, Abilify Maintena, Aristada and some generics all contain aripiprazole. The FDA says the impulse-control problems are rare, but can be serious. Those impulses could include the type of uncontrollable urges that could harm both the person suffering from the side effects and the people near them. \"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that compulsive or uncontrollable urges to gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex have been reported with the use of the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole (Abilify, Abilify Maintena, Aristada, and generics). These uncontrollable urges were reported to have stopped when the medicine was discontinued or the dose was reduced. These impulse-control problems are rare, but they may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized.\" The effects go away after patients stop taking or reduce the dosage of a prescription with aripiprazole, but The FDA warns that patients should talk to their doctor before they stop using the drug.

The entire island of Oahu is essentially turned over to the Secret Service for the president's two week Christmas vacation, and while he limits his movements to a pretty predictable area, the security measures still affect tourists and locals alike. By Land: Concrete blockades and security patrols block the entrance to the neighborhood where the president stays and \"no parking\" signs keep the streets clear. Doug Miller lives just outside the security check-points and has devised a system using a little Chia Obama likeness to communicate Obama's movements to his neighbors. \"When we have him facing down the road that means that he's still out -- the motorcade is out,\" Miller told Hawaii News Now, \"but if he's come in and is in residence then we just turn it back facing the place that he's staying.

While the existing security systems are disabled, bullet proof glass is installed as are additional, secure phone lines.

And more importantly, when we asked successfully married couples how important sex is to the success of their marriage \u2014 to rank on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest \u2014 the average rank was only 6! This finding has held true over the more than 30 years of our research. The results are hardly a resounding endorsement for the importance of sex in a successful marriage. You see, marriage is a multi-faceted and highly complex relationship, and in the best marriages, no one aspect stands out as the \"make or break\" part of it. The truth is, there are seven pervasive characteristics present in all successful marriages. And guess what: sex isn't one of them! Sex is only one part of the seven characteristics of a successful marriage. As we say so often in our many interviews and writings, all of the married couples, representing the best marriages we've interviewed, have shared with us the importance of touching in their relationship. One gentleman we interviewed told us that if he passed his wife in the house a hundred times a day, he touched her.

Neither Ben nor Jen will confirm or deny the divorce allegations. Ben still calls Jennifer his \"wife\" as he did during an HBO interview with Bill Simmons last week. Despite his unusual appearance on Any Given Wednesday, Ben Affleck was very clear once more how supportive Jennifer Garner was of him while he rebuilt his career. But as recent as three weeks ago, Jennifer Garner had plans on divorcing her husband. So does Ben\u2019s HBO appearance mean he still hopes they can reconcile? Does he still believe he can get Jen to come around and change her mind and not finally file divorce papers? According to an exclusive ET Online report, a source quotes that they are making it work. They also come right out and say that they don\u2019t know if they will ever get a divorce: \"They still have not officially filed paperwork for a divorce,\" the source", "If you give your children Nurofen you need to read this.

The mother-of-two explained that she and her husband Shaun both tried the Nurofen afterwards and they too felt a burning sensation in their throats and started coughing. She immediately called a local pharmacist who confirmed that that\u2019s not how the medicine should taste. Deakin contacted Nurofen and the Co-op from which it was bought, and the medicine has now been taken off the shelves. \"Tyldesley Co-op have been fantastic,\" Deakin told Manchester Evening News. \"They instantly responded to my complaint by taking the product off their shelves and by contacting the manufacturer who makes the medicine.\" Nurofen are also taking the product for testing.

The Internet search giant paid a tax rate of 2.6 percent on $8.1 billion in non-U.S. income in 2012, because it channelled almost all of its overseas profits to a subsidiary in Bermuda which levies no corporate income tax, the group's accounts show. Corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the international agenda in the past year with the G20 and G8 groups of leading economies promising to get to grips with the growing practice of companies diverting profits from where they are earned and into tax havens. Google said it follows all tax rules in every country where it operates and that it does not pay much tax in Britain because its profits are not generated by its UK employees. Google UK Ltd, and other subsidiaries across mainland Europe, pay little tax because they are designated as providers of marketing services to Google Ireland Ltd, the Dublin-based subsidiary whose name appears on invoices to most non-U.S. clients.

Turner's lawyer had argued at the June 2 hearing that Turner admitted to \"digitally penetrating\" the women, but that Turner claims he recalls the victim giving consent. Judge Persky believed him. Here's what he said: \"I mean, I take him at his word that, subjectively, that's his version of events. The jury, obviously, found it not to be the sequence of events.\" In essence, this implies the judge disregarded the jury's conviction and used his own judgment to decide the punishment for the three felony charges. According to The Washington Post, Judge Persky also remarked that Turner's regret or guilt was real \u2014 despite Turner never accepting the charge. Post reporter Susan Svrluga wrote, \"He said he believed Turner felt genuine remorse.\" But then he also acknowledged that the victim didn't think Turner acknowledged what he'd done. \"In essence, [Judge Persky] said the defendant doesn\u2019t have to agree with the verdict to feel truly sorry,\" Svrluga pointed out.

But before you become the go-to person with a wallet as wide open as your heart, consider having a strategy so that your donated dollars do the most good. Kay McFarlin, president at TIAA Charitable, says that because we're all different, there's no one size-fits all approach when it comes to giving, and it helps to consult with a financial professional if you're at all confused. It's also important for individuals to hone in on the charities and causes they want to focus on. There are millions of great charities in the United States, which can be a bit overwhelming, she said. She also advised looking into Donor Advised Funds (DAFs), sort of like charitable savings accounts, which allow you to write one check that will be distributed to many organizations upon your recommendation while your un-donated money grows. But do your homework before signing up, and make sure the institution you choose is doing what they promise.

But a survey of activists in the cannabis community revealed there is a legitimate debate over the term, as well as words like \"dope,\" \"stoner,\" and \"pothead.\" \"I say weed all the time, and people are offended,\" said Lisa Campbell, chairwoman of Women Grow Toronto. \"Apparently words like 'weed' and 'pothead' have stigma associated with them.

Interestingly, the 31-year-old actor opted to arrange a backstage chat with DeGeneres after his official appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" which airs March 9, to speak about the subject.

On the smash Fox series, Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, an openly gay singer-songwriter who is the ex-boyfriend of Michael Sanchez (Rafael de La Fuente). In his \"Ellen\" appearance, Smollett revealed that he landed his \"Empire\" audition after sending co-creator Lee Daniels a private message on Instagram.

Space adventure fans might enjoy NASA\u2019s latest saga, the story of a rocket to nowhere that Congress wants, very badly, built in Alabama. Or they might be really pissed off. In its 2017 budget request, NASA asked Congress for $1.3 billion to build its next jumbo rocket. Last week, despite years of fighting with the Obama Administration over its plans to explore an asteroid with the rocket, the Senate Appropriations Committee not only granted the request, but gave the space agency an extra $995 million to build it. A surprise billion dollars may sound good. But while adding money to \"Space Operations,\" the Appropriations Committee also cut $660 million from NASA\u2019s science, aeronautics, and space technology programs that build the telescopes, observatories, planes, and landers that make the agency so beloved. In justifying this decision, the committee wrote that the rocket \"is the nation\u2019s launch vehicle that will enable humans to explore space beyond current capabilities.\" The futuristic space rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), won\u2019t send any astronauts into space until at least 2023, and it doesn\u2019t even have a destination.

Now, it's easy to point to activist investors as the villains who force boards to return cash to shareholders at the risk of damaging companies' long-term development. But activists are not the only ones pushing for heightened returns. Bloomberg's Alex Barinka reports that the CEOs of America's large cap companies have a lot to gain from it too. Of the 15 (non-Wall Street) companies that returned the most money to shareholders via buybacks last year, 11 based their chief executives' compensation on earnings per share, total shareholder return, or both, according to the report. So when a company like IBM spends money, say, buying back stock from investors, or paying out dividends, that tends to boost its share price. And when the share price goes up, so does the CEO's pay. In fact, IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty depends quite a bit on operating earnings per share \u2013 almost 40 percent of her pay package is based on it, according to Bloomberg. At Disney, CEO Bob Iger's performance-based stock award hinges both on total shareholder returns and earnings per share, compared with the S&P 500 index. It's a win-win.

The settlement 21st Century Fox announced Tuesday regarding former anchor Gretchen Carlson, who filed a lawsuit this summer claiming sexual harassment by the powerful -- and now ousted -- Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, was extraordinary in many ways. There was the speed with which the suit went from being filed, on July 6, to being settled, just two months later. There was the reported size of the settlement, $20 million , which employment lawyers say is the largest single plaintiff pre-trial settlement for sexual harassment charges they know of (many are settled privately). But perhaps the most striking aspect of the settlement was the company's public apology to Carlson in its statement, a move employment lawyers said was extremely rare, if not unprecedented, when it comes to sexual harassment claims. \"Typically the last thing a plaintiff ever receives in a pre-trial settlement is an apology,\" said Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who often represents plaintiffs in sexual harassment lawsuits. \"It clearly is a recognition that she was right that she was treated inappropriately, and that in and of itself is quite stunning.\" In its statement, 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, where Carlson was a former anchor", "Here's How You Can Actually Do Yoga At Home.

Researchers Dr. Jonathan Emberson and Dr. Robert Clarke said they examined information on 7,000 older men -- mean age 77 -- from 1997-2012. They found that 5,000 of the 7,000 men died, but that deaths in current smokers were about 50 percent higher than in those who never smoked due primarily to vascular disease, cancer and respiratory diseases. Hazard ratios for overall mortality and various causes of death in relation to smoking habits were determined after considering other factors such as age, employment and health concerns. \"Despite recent declines in the numbers of people smoking and tar yields of cigarettes, smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death in Europe,\" Emberson said in a press release. He added: \"Previous studies had demonstrated that prolonged cigarette smoking from early adult life was associated with about 10 years loss of life expectancy, with about one quarter of smokers killed by their habit before the age of 70. Stopping at ages 60, 50, 40 or 30 years gained back about three, six, nine or the full 10 years. However, the hazards of continuing to smoke and the benefits of stopping in older people had not been widely studied.\" Emberson said the study shows that", "You Won't Believe How Much More Women Pay for Healthcare Than Men.

Do-overs for job seekers are rare, and the few who get a second chance make an argument that is both highly persuasive and humble, says Susan Peppercorn, a senior consultant with ClearRock Inc., an executive-coaching and career-consulting firm in Boston. \"The key to any redo is, what can you do for the company?\" Ms. Peppercorn says. Abhijit Phadnis was excited as an M.B.A. student years ago about landing a financial-manager position at a consumer-products company. He was deeply disappointed when he was rejected. At Ms. Peppercorn\u2019s suggestion, Mr. Phadnis emailed the hiring manager thanking him and asking for feedback. He was told that his interview answers focused too much on his past work on various teams, and failed to explain how his individual skills fit the job. Mr. Phadnis fired off an impassioned email asking the hiring manager for a second chance. Hoping the job hadn\u2019t been filled yet, he admitted he hadn\u2019t done as well as he should", "Mic Discovered Who Created Trump's Anti-Semitic Hillary Meme\u2014And It's Disturbing.

Amy Cuddy, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, has some fail-safe tips on how to feel powerful instantly no matter what you are wearing. Professor Cuddy, whose TED Talk about 'power poses' has galvanized millions of viewers around the world, reveals how small tweaks to body language can help us perform at our best and liberate ourselves from fear in high-pressure moments.  Writing in her book, Presence, Professor Cuddy said: 'Expanding your body language - through posture, movement and speech - makes you feel more confident and powerful, less anxious and self-absorbed, and generally more positive.' From breaking up with your partner to an important interview, these tips can be applied to dozens of everyday situations. Here, FEMAIL shares six of Professor Cuddy's  best tips... 1. WARM UP WITH BIG POSES Before you walk into a challenge - be it an athletic event or business negotiation - adopt a pose that takes up as much space as you possibly can.  Professor Cuddy writes: 'By doing this you're telling yourself that you're powerful - that you've got this - which emancipates you to bring your boldest, most authentic self to the challenge.  'You're optimising your brain to", "Why You Shouldn't Scare Your Cat With a Cucumber. According to IFLScience, the cats\u2019 fearful reactions\u2014which include jumping, running, or pawing at the long green vegetable\u2014are likely due to the surprise element of having an unexpected object placed into their territory without notice. In short, you could likely replicate the experiment with any other vegetable. (Animal behavior specialists also have other theories, including that the cats might think the cucumber is a deadly snake or other predator.) However, National Geographic reports that your cat\u2019s fright is more harmful than hilarious. While the cucumber isn\u2019t stressful to you, it\u2019s stressful to the cat. And since your pet usually has positive associations with the space surrounding its food bowl, you\u2019re startling it while it\u2019s in its comfort zone. In worst case scenarios, it can react by hurting itself, breaking a household object, or remaining anxious for days. Bottom line? Slowly introduce new toys and objects to your cat, as they\u2019re a source of mental stimulation. Just don\u2019t unexpectedly give it a cucumber\u2014or for that matter, any other new item that might cause distress.", "The Obscure Blogger Who Reversed the Recession.

At Glamour's 2013 Women of the Year Awards on Monday, the December Glamour cover girl accepted her award with a sharp critique of her own recent Glamour photos. Speaking onstage at Carnegie Hall, Lady Gaga said that, like fellow honoree Malala Yousafzai, she was going to use her voice to speak up about her cover. \"I felt my skin looked too perfect. I felt my hair looked too soft,\" said the star. \"I do not look like this when I wake up in the morning... I don't even look like this,\" referring to her wild wig and makeup for the evening. Speaking slowly and measuredly, Gaga made it clear that the way covers like hers are tweaked and smoothed has damaging effects on the readers who see them. She urged the young people listening to \"fight back against the forces that make them feel like they're not beautiful,\" and she also called for the publications themselves to change: \"It is fair to write about the change in your magazines. But what I want to see is the change on your covers... When the covers change, that's when culture changes.\" Gaga's outspoken critique was a bold move, given that she was receiving", "A Stanford professor says eliminating 2 phrases from your vocabulary can make you more successful. Swapping one word for another could make all the difference in how you approach your goals. That's according to Bernard Roth, a professor of engineering at Stanford and the academic director of Stanford's Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (the d.school). In his new book, \" The Achievement Habit ,\" Roth suggests several linguistic tweaks that can make you more successful. Here are two of the easiest: 1. Swap \"but\" for \"and.\" You might be tempted to say, \"I want to go to the movies, but I have work to do.\" Instead, Roth suggests saying, \"I want to go to the movies, and I have work to do.\" He writes: \"When you use the word but , you create a conflict (and sometimes a reason) for yourself that does not really exist.\" In other words, it's possible to go to the movies as well as do your work - you just need to find a solution. Meanwhile, when you use the word and , \"your brain gets to consider how it can deal with both parts of the sentence,\" Roth writes. Maybe you'll see a shorter movie; maybe you'll delegate some of your work. 2. Swap \"have to\" for \"want to.\" Roth", "You Won\u2019t Believe What Happens to Dogs on the Iditarod Trail. This grueling race has proved deadly to dogs for many years. Dog deaths are so common during the race that Rule 42 of the official Iditarod rules blithely acknowledges that some dogs\u2019 deaths may be considered \"unpreventable.\" How then, in good conscience, in 2017, can an event known to cause animals to suffer and die be celebrated? As the 2017 Iditarod approaches, it\u2019s important to remember the dogs who are injured and killed as well as disturbing facts about the race: At least 27 dogs used in the Iditarod have died just since 2004. In 2016, Nash died after being hit by a snowmobile during the race. In 2015, dogs Stiffy and Wyatt both died on the trail, and a dog named Stuart got loose and was later hit by a car. Countless dogs are injured. In 2015, they included dogs used by musher Yuka Honda, who crashed into a sled and was then run over by another\u2013and Laura, a 5-year-old dog who, according to news reports, was essentially \"blind\" and often seemed \"confused\" but was forced to race anyway by Kelly Maixner.

Two LA city councilmen on Friday introduced a motion that would ban the growth, sale and distribution of genetically engineered seeds and plants. The councilmen, Paul Koretz and Mitch O\u2019Farrell, said the measure is meant to protect local gardens and homegrown food from contamination by genetically modified seeds. The motion would not affect the sale of food containing genetically modified ingredients. \"We don't want to consume mystery food,\" O'Farrell told The Huffington Post. \"Since there's currently no requirement, anyone could unwittingly purchase a genetically modified product and not know it. I think that's irresponsible.\" Genetically modified organisms have had their DNA altered by genetic engineering -- for example, a gene from another plant species, bacterium or virus may have been introduced into the organism's DNA. Genetically modified seeds are used mostly by large farmers, of which there are none in LA. \"But if they become marketed to home gardeners, we're going to have this ban in place,\" David King, head of Learning Garden and Seed Library of LA, told HuffPost. \"The pending ordinance would be symbolic more than anything else, but we do feel it's an important step to have the second-largest city in the nation declare itself as against genetically", "Why Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s fate could hang on a single word. In finding Arpaio and three of his top commanders in contempt of court on Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow said no fewer than 19 times that the sheriff or his aides had repeatedly and intentionally violated judicial orders to stop profiling Latinos. On May 31, Snow will determine the civil penalties and examine whether Arpaio, the sheriff of Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, will be referred to Arizona\u2019s U.S. attorney for potential criminal charges. Arpaio has acknowledged violating Snow\u2019s order, but said it was a mistake. In weighing criminal charges, Snow must decide whether Arpaio\u2019s violations of his orders were intentional. In the meantime, the judge had unusually harsh words for Arpaio. \"The Defendants\u2019 unfair, partial, and inequitable application of discipline disproportionally (sic) damaged members of the Plaintiff class,\" Snow wrote. In a 2011 civil case brought by Latino drivers against Arpaio and his aides, Snow determined that Arpaio had encouraged his deputies to subject Latino drivers to greater scrutiny during traffic stops than white drivers typically received. He ordered the sheriff to put an end to the practice. Two years later, Snow found that Arpaio had continued the practice in violation of the order.

Unbelievable as it may seem, of the 100 major deaths that have happened over the past six seasons of Game of Thrones, the most expensive had nothing to do with dragons, white walkers or even wildfire. During the recent Thrones panel at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss revealed the death scene with the largest price tag to date was the season five scene when Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) gouges Ser Meryn Trant\u2019s (Ian Beattie) eyes out before slitting his throat. When asked why Trant\u2019s death \u2014 which let Arya cross off the first name on her infamous kill list \u2014 ran up the costs of filming so high, Benioff had a very simple answer. \"She couldn\u2019t really poke out his eyes,\" he said, according to RadioTimes.", "What the hell is wrong with Lionel Messi?

When I first saw Lionel Messi with platinum blond hair, I was sure that it was a joke. A gross monster created in Photoshop by someone with a distaste for the man and human decency.

He then congratulated the newlyweds and asked the incredulous members of the Milestone Band if they wanted to do a song together (obvious answer: yes!).

The enormous artwork, named \"Wish\" by Rodriguez-Gerada, is the largest land art portrait in the United Kingdom and Ireland, according to the Belfast Telegraph. Best visible by plane or helicopter, the portrait took 18 months of planning and one month of construction to complete. \"Wish wasn't something that just got presented, it was a process,\" Rodriguez-Gerada told the Telegraph. \"Getting to know the city on multiple trips and letting the creative flow helped bring the image to me of what I wanted to do.\" The Cuban-American Rodriguez-Gerada is the Belfast Festival at Queen's first artist in residence.

Some games have players that hang around until the next installment releases a year later. Other games are played for a month or two, and are then retired onto bookshelves and external hard drives. Then you have Grand Theft Auto, with devoted fans that keep the game alive years after its initial release. Since the record breaking Grand Theft Auto V was released nearly three years ago, profits from the game have steadily climbed. The implementation of online DLC has been a cash cow for Rockstar Games as well. The game has done so well that it broke eight Guinness World Records right after its release: best-selling video game in 24 hours best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours highest grossing video game in 24 hours fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion fastest video game to gross $1 billion highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video game Even though the game has been in circulation for almost three years, it is still in high demand.

The \"podium value\" of the gold medal at the Rio 2016 Olympics is approximately $564 , based on the price of gold at $43.76 per gram and the price of sterling silver at 61 cents per gram, as of Thursday. This is in line with the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games (about $566, even though that medal was 31 grams heavier). However, it is a long way off from the approximate $708 record price of the 2012 London gold medal, due to the record high price of gold and silver at the time. If the entire medal was made of gold it would be valued at nearly $22,000, which is why 1912 was the last time all-gold medals were awarded. A total of 2,488 medals were produced for the Rio 2016 Olympics (812 gold, 812 silver and 864 bronze) by the Mint of Brazil.

If the invitation did not include a plus one or an extra guest, then do not bring one! It's always best to play it safe and assume that it is an invitation for one unless it is otherwise noted. #2 While this one should be obvious, don't be the guest that drinks too much at the reception. Remember, this is a celebration for the people you love, NOT a frat party. At the end of the day, know your limits and don't make a fool out of yourself. #3 This may seem funny, but you wouldn't believe how often it happens. Do not stick your fingers in the wedding cake! Unfortunately, guests actually do this. Yuck! Not only is it unsanitary, but the bride and groom have spent a lot of money on this cake. Be respectful. #4 Don't use the wedding as an excuse to hookup. While it's true that weddings are a great place to meet other singles, this is a wedding, not a club. Refrain from making out with someone you just met on the dance floor. If you're attracted to someone, get a phone number and", "J.K. Rowling Reveals the Powerful Metaphor Behind Remus Lupin's Werewolf Condition. In a section of Short Stories From Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies, J.K. Rowling details the life of Remus Lupin, from childhood until his untimely death at the hands of Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. Lupin \u2014 who Rowling calls \"one of her favourite characters in the entire Potter series\" \u2014 was, of course, a werewolf. And according to the author, his lycanthropy is a metaphor for illnesses that exist in the Muggle world. \"Lupin's condition of lycanthropy was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS,\" Rowling writes. \"All kinds of superstitions seem to surround blood-borne conditions, probably due to taboos surrounding blood itself. The wizarding community is as prone to hysteria and prejudice as the Muggle one, and the character of Lupin gave me a chance to examine those attitudes.\" Remus Lupin alienated himself from the world because of his condition. He became a werewolf on his fifth birthday, as detailed in the short story about his life found in Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies, as well as on Pottermore.

Below, we've managed to cram all of the atheists serving on Capitol Hill into one important GIF: Yeah, there isn't a single admitted atheist currently in Congress. For purposes of demonstration, however, the cat can represent former Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.), who left Congress in 2012 as its only avowed atheist. Much like the flying feline, he fell a bit short of his mark after having his legs taken out from under him by another Democrat, thanks to California's \"top-two\" primary election system. A few months after retiring, former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) also announced his nonbeliever status, a declaration he made more than 25 years after coming out as the first openly gay member of Congress. That Frank felt more comfortable going public with his sexuality in 1987 than he did with his secular beliefs at any point during his House career says a lot about the stigma surrounding atheism in electoral politics. In 2011, Herb Silverman of the Secular Coalition of America told the Guardian that his group was aware of 27 members of Congress other than Stark \"that have no belief in God.\" It's unclear who they were, or are, but none of them -- perhaps except Frank", "Linus Torvalds reveals his favorite programming laptop.

The natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago! It was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions. One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium. That meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds)", "Here's what we know about Bobby Murphy, Snapchat's mysterious billionaire cofounder. Together, Murphy and Spiegel own the vast majority of Snap's voting stock, giving them complete control over the company's future. Now that Snap has gone public, Murphy has an estimated net worth of around $5.4 billion. Unlike Spiegel, Murphy has maintained a decidedly low profile since the beginning of the company. He's only given a handful of interviews, and little is known about his personal life. People who've worked with Murphy describe the 28-year-old as smart, friendly, and quiet. \"I'd describe him almost like a monk,\" Snapchat's first hire, David Kravitz, told Forbes in 2014. \"I don't think I've ever seen him upset.\"", "\"Twilight\" star now playing a god. \"We didn't want to make a movie that is just this brooding guy who's just going from fight to fight, and just being violent and brutish,\" director Renny Harlin (\"Die Hard 2\" and \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\") said. \"For us, the love story was very much the heart and key to his character and his story.\" The trailer previews Hercules being exiled after his love interest, Hebe (played by Gaia Weiss), is set to marry another man.

With her joie de vivre and insatiable appetite for the opposite sex, Taylor had the kind of love life most of us can only dream about. She lived her best life and in the process, taught us quite a bit about relationships before she died at age 79 in 2011. In honor of what would have been her 85th birthday, here are nine things we learned about love from Liz, the fiercest old Hollywood dame of all.  \"I don\u2019t pretend to be an ordinary housewife. I am not and couldn\u2019t be,\" the mom of four once remarked. And it was true \u2014 the actress was anything but ordinary. While her peers played the perfect housewife in photo spreads for Life and Look magazines, La Liz made no bones about her career ambition and racked up husbands like it was NBD at a time when divorce wasn\u2019t nearly as accepted as it is now. She was seriously a woman before her time. Taylor\u2019s fifth (and sixth!) husband Richard Burton waxed poetic about his wife in his private diaries: \"She is shy and witty, she is nobody\u2019s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography,\" he", "This university has more NCAA championships than black male freshmen. A group of students, led by Sy Stokes, posted a video voicing their concerns about the number of black students on campus, and their message is hard to ignore. Stokes, a third-year Afro-American studies student who identifies as black, Cherokee and Chinese, recites a spoken word poem in the video, citing blaring statistics about the university's diversity issue. According to the school's enrollment statistics, African-Americans make up 3.8 percent of the student population. In the video, Stokes points out that black males make up 3.3 percent of the male student population, and that 65 percent of those black males are undergraduate athletes. Of the incoming men in the freshmen class, only 1.9 percent of them were black. In an interview with the Daily Bruin, Stokes said he almost dropped out of UCLA during his first year because he felt isolated and uncomfortable. Although he eventually found his niche in the minority community, he said he wanted to raise awareness about the school's lack of diversity before the university's application deadline on Nov. 30. \"We had to do something to put our issues on the map,\" Stokes said.

After a few weeks of chatting on dating website Plenty of Fish, Janine Hall met her date at the Cheesecake Factory in Missouri. They had a \"wonderful meal and great conversation,\" Hall told People. They continued talking after their meal, until Hall\u2019s date started coughing. She told People: We weren\u2019t eating so I knew he wasn\u2019t choking. I turned my head to the side to give him some privacy and then the next thing I knew there were dishes falling onto my side of the booth. Her date stood up and collapsed.

They found a slight increase in both heart attacks and deaths from heart attack in Quebec after a storm. The likelihood went up with each extra day of snow, they reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. \"We suspect that shoveling was the main mechanism linking snowfall with myocardial infarction (heart attack),\" Dr. Nathalie Auger of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Center and colleagues wrote. \"Men are potentially more likely than women to shovel, particularly after heavy snowfalls. Snow shoveling is a demanding cardiovascular exercise requiring more than 75 percent of the maximum heart rate, particularly with heavy loads,\" they added. The team studied 128,000 heart attack cases between 1981 and 2014, and more than 68,000 people who died. A single day of snowfall raised a man's risk of heart attack by just less than 1 percent, they wrote, and it raised his risk of dying from a heart attack by 12 percent. Eight inches of snowfall raised the risk 16 percent compared to a day in the same month that did not have snow, they reported, and men were one-third more likely to die of a heart attack the day after an eight-inch snowfall, compared to a dry day.", "What impressed me most about the iPhone 6 Plus is something nobody really talks about. In terms of sheer size and quality, the iPhone 6 Plus' giant screen was a huge improvement over my iPhone 5, which now feels as tiny as a Tic-Tac. The battery life lasts almost two days even after long phone calls and frequent Bluetooth use. The camera quality has significantly improved, too. These are all things I expected, and they're a large part of the reason I bought the phone in the first place. But, after using the phone for almost a month, I was pleasantly surprised to discover something that impressed me even more: the phone's speakers. The speakers on the iPhone 6 Plus are incredibly loud, clear, and vibrant. Since I don't own any speaker accessories for the iPhone 6 Plus, I typically use my MacBook Pro to listen to music and podcasts aloud. Recently, however, I decided to use my iPhone 6 Plus instead, and it's worked better than I ever would have expected. With the volume turned up to its maximum setting, I'm able to distinctly hear music and podcasts in a medium sized room (roughly about 8 x 9 ft). The sound is so boisterous you can hear it in the next room over, too. It's", "Is Outkast recording a new album?

We knew this would be an important role for the 19-year-old actress because it will be her biggest project to date. She\u2019s been on television in shows such as K.C. Undercover, Shake It Up!, and the TV movie Zapped, but nothing as big as the Sony/Marvel collaboration happening for Homecoming.

Credit: Shutterstock Sign No. 1: They handle criticism without denial, blame, excuses or anxiety. One of the hallmarks of high emotional intelligence is self-awareness. Self-awareness is a deep understanding of what makes us tick; what angers us, makes us happy, bores and interests us. It's also means that we can appraise ourselves, faults and all, with great honesty and clarity. So when people with high emotional intelligence make a mistake and get criticized for it, it doesn't send them into an emotional tailspin. It's simply a fact to be noted, analyzed and corrected. Not everyone with high emotional intelligence reacts to criticism in the same exact way. Some people deal with it more empathically, and instantly wonder Why did this person just criticize me? And they seek to understand what does this criticism mean for our working relationship moving forward? Others handle criticism more like a process engineer looking to root-cause a product defect, systematically dissecting every step leading up to the thing they just got criticized for. Their first thought is I need to figure out exactly what went wrong.

A small Yorkshire pub which was saved from closure by its local community after going bankrupt has been named the best in the UK.

But, by raising \u00a3220,000, the locals were able to buy the pub back and perform extensive renovations.

From being a talented musician to walking a dog, there are plenty of traits and behaviors that can amp up your sex appeal to women \u2014 especially if you're looking to land a long-term relationship. A growing body of research on romantic attraction has focused on the importance of altruism: Men who display helping behaviors are generally perceived as more attractive than those who don't. In a 2013 study on the topic, researchers had young, heterosexual men and women rate pictures of other men and women on how attractive they would be for short- and long-term relationships. Some of the people pictured were said to engage in altruistic behaviors, such as volunteering at a homeless shelter. Other people pictured were described in neutral ways, such as \"loves Chinese food.\" Both men and women rated the altruistic people as more attractive for long-term relationships \u2014 but women showed a stronger preference for altruism than men did. More recent research suggests that altruism could be even more appealing than good looks. In a study published this year, researchers looked exclusively at heterosexual women's preferences for attractiveness and altruism in men. About 200 women were asked to look at photographs of men's faces. Half", "Are You Reading The Wrong Books? What Science Is Saying About Fiction Readers.

The deal unravelled just hours after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recommended that the proposed merger be reviewed by a federal judged over antitrust concerns.

That would have set a record exceeding the roughly $270 million Wall Street made in 2001 from Comcast\u2019s purchase of AT&T\u2019s broadband service.

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 prevents every nation on Earth from sending a mission, robot or human, close to a water source in the fear of contaminating it with life from Earth [PDF]. In its 140-million-mile journey from Earth to Mars, it\u2019s possible that Curiosity has carried harmful microbes all the way from home. Even though NASA tries its best to sterilize all space-traveling equipment before launch by subjecting it to intense ultraviolet light, it still might harbor microbial hitchhikers. In theory, NASA could turn up the heat and radiation to a level pretty much guaranteed to destroy any microbial life\u2014but that could also end up wiping out the rover\u2019s internal systems. \"In order to be completely sterile, they'd have to use really powerful ionizing radiation or heat, both of which would damage the electronics,\" University of New South Wales astrobiologist Malcolm Walter told Fairfax Media. \"So they go as far as they dare.\" Another issue that would prevent Curiosity from investigating the water source is the terrain itself.

The assault on western Mosul has, thus far, been largely as expected - a much better equipped and better trained Iraqi army than the one humiliated by IS in 2014, methodically pushing towards the edge of the city thanks to overwhelming fire power and the cover of coalition air strikes. For all their brutality and intolerance, IS fighters are nothing if not ingenious and in recent days they have been deploying a battle tactic almost unprecedented in modern urban warfare - the use of commercially available drones to drop bombs and grenades against civilian and military targets. Large military drones are, of course, used to devastating effect by armies all over the Middle East, often resulting in huge loss of life. But the frequency and accuracy of how the Islamic State group is utilising small, relatively unsophisticated drones in Mosul has significantly slowed the advance of government forces. The drones have also caused panic among the civilian population, including residents of eastern", "Hotel staff reveal guests' most GRUESOME habits. And some unfortunate workers have been forced to put up with some very unpleasant behaviour, according to a new Reddit discussion. After being asked what guests do to get under their skin, hotel workers made some very candid confessions, involving used condoms being discarded under beds and women flashing the porter instead of giving a tip. One eyebrow-raising tale came from someone who had worked at a hotel in Gran Canaria last summer and witnessed numerous parents forgetting to collect their children from the kids club because they were drunk. Finding out rather too much about strangers' sex lives was a common complaint, with one worker complaining about guests who call staff to the room, and then make them wait outside while they get intimate. Another worker reported being called to men's rooms who then perform a sex act in front of them, while others insist on answer the door naked. Others complained of wedding parties trashing their hotel rooms, while one claimed a guess had drunk from the mini bar and then refilled the bottles with their urine. People complaining about the slightest thing to get a discount was another particular bugbear.  ", "\"Breaking Bad\" spinoff adds first big star.

We learned Wednesday that the Islamic State fired crude chemical weapons at our fighting men and women over in Iraq. It was a powdered form of a mustard agent fired at a U.S. air base near Mosul. There were no deaths or injuries, but it is certainly a shocking development in the war against the terrorists. Barack Obama, however, really had nothing to say on the issue. In fact, he was busy talking about something else: Global warming. While the country was coming to grips with this new phase in the Iraq conflict, President Obama was busy on Facebook, sending videos warning us of his real adversary... climate change. The Obama administration has already claimed that climate change is the \"greatest threat to national security\" dozens of times, so why should a poison gas attack change his mind, right? And Hillary Clinton thinks we don\u2019t even have any ground troops in Iraq. We have thousands.

A bad hire can be financially costly to your company and set back your team\u2019s progress. There\u2019s an enormous burden on managers tasked with determining what their team needs and then making a judgment call on who can fill that role, within a relatively short period of time. Experience, intelligence, and determination are all important aspects to consider when looking at a job candidate, but the primary focus needs to be on talent, argue Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman in their classic management guide, \"First, Break All the Rules.\" When the book was first published in 1999, Buckingham told Business Insider, it was controversial for its conclusion that the best managers develop their employees\u2019 strengths and ignore their weaknesses, since the prevailing wisdom was that bosses should amass a team of well-rounded individuals always correcting their shortcomings. The coauthors\u2019 conclusions weren\u2019t based on intuition, but rather 25 years of Gallup studies of 80,000 managers across 400 companies.

Anyone over the age of 18 caught with 10 grams or less of the drug will no longer have to make a court appearance and will not have offenses entered into their permanent record; instead, violators will have to pay a fine of 100 Swiss Francs (approximately $110), then be on their way. Lawmakers in the country relaxed weed regulations in an effort to unify what had been a patchwork of often confusing policies that varied from one local area to another. Per The Independent, the measure is also expected to save money by cutting back on the 30,000 marijuana-related cases courts have had to handle each year. It will also free up police resources to pursue larger drug trafficking incidents. But \"decriminalized\" is not the same as \"legal,\" as a Swiss Broadcasting Corporation report makes clear.

That night, at the 65th Academy Awards, a young underdog with a handful of bit roles in movies, one soap opera, and one sitcom under her belt beat out her four fellow nominees in the Actress in a Supporting Role category\u2014for a role in a comedy. The category\u2019s four other nominated actors\u2014Judy Davis, Joan Plowright, Vanessa Redgrave, and Miranda Richardson\u2014all had more experience and critical respect. Their movies (Husbands and Wives, Enchanted April, Howards End, and Damage, respectively) were decidedly heavier and more Oscar-friendly than the crowd-pleasing sleeper hit, My Cousin Vinny, for which the Oscar was awarded to Tomei.

Of course that's an average number, so there are people watching less than an hour and 40 minutes daily (Mhm.) and people who are watching more. Cordcutting.com calculated the number by dividing the total number of Netflix streaming hours per day (125 million hours worldwide, CEO Reed Hastings recently confirmed) by the number of subscribers (75 million). Compared to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report, which estimates the average human exercises about 17 minutes a day, reads for 19 minutes, and only socializes for another 38, that Netflix number is ... high. You can see comparatively just how high in Cordcutting's chart below: Though if you spend your post-work time watching Jessica Jones, and then all your other waking hours discussing it and all its related fan fic with people around you, aren't you checking several boxes off the list when you're watching Netflix?

Seriously though, test it out with a friend, and unless you're an exceptional human being, you will never ever catch that dollar bill. But don't feel bad - there's a mathematical reason for why it can't be done, and it's rooted in the biological fact that the reaction time for most humans is about 0.2 seconds. Yep, 0.2 seconds approximately how long it takes for you to see something, process it, and physically react to it, which is actually pretty impressive when you think about it. But that's not nearly quick enough for your eyes to see that falling dollar bill, and have your brain to process that information, and instruct your fingers to snap together in time to catch it. So case closed, right? Well not quite, because you're perfectly capable of catching things on the fly - humans aren't completely useless - so why not some sweet, sweet cash? As the Numberphile video above explains, it all comes down to some good old high school maths.

The images emerged last week from a man in Victoria, Australia, who seems to have found the frog in his garden. However, as any frog sex enthusiast will tell you, frogs don't have penises. Most frog species mate in a process called amplexus, where fertilization of eggs occurs outside the body. As Gerry Marantelli from the Australian Amphibian Research Centre told BuzzFeed News , this impressive piece of manhood is most likely to be an \"extra partially formed leg.\" Yep, it's literally a \"third leg.\" Gerry added: \"It\u2019s not a penis, frogs don\u2019t have them, but penises did evolve from \u2018legs\u2019 during embryonic development so an extra leg is part way there. Amphibians in one way likely invented the penis (albeit not the modern one).\" But don\u2019t feel too sorry for frogs. Like many species of birds, reptiles, and other amphibians, frogs have a cloaca. This organ, which can be found in both females and males, acts as passage for waste and sperm or eggs (on a offbeat side note, some turtles can even breath out of them). The males of the tailed frog species actually have an extended reproductive tract that it uses to funnel sperm. So, if you're still", "The one item that looks amazing on every woman.

Across the country, state legislatures had been hard at work in 2016 crafting new laws to take effect on January 1, 2017, Clayton Morris reported. As of Sunday in Illinois, it is now legal to hunt for catfish with pitchforks or spears. Spearfishing has always been legal in many place, but until now, it depended on the type of fish the fisherman was hunting, according to Kerry Picket of the Daily Caller. Farther west in Oregon, the state legislature banned the use of 'sky lanterns'; decorative lighted boxes released into the air at celebrations. Picket said fire marshals do not like the risk these items present, should they float away and land on something that could be damaged like a building or a copse of trees. In Pennsylvania, beer customers are now able to purchase six-packs at local grocery stores, and are able to purchase beverages in any quantity from a beer distributor.

Despite being such an enormous company, and an important name in the music space for years now, Amazon.com has been fairly quiet on the streaming front. Now, it looks like that is about to change. According to a report published by Recode , the company is looking to dive headfirst into the highly competitive streaming music industry in its own way. Sources say that Amazon is looking to launch a new streaming service in the coming months that would come with the discounted price of only $5 (or potentially even $4), but as is the case whenever anything seems too cheap to be real, there is a catch. The streaming platform and all of the music offered on it would only be playable via Amazon\u2019s Echo device, which the company has made a priority ever since it launched just over one year ago. Apparently, Amazon has yet to get all of the major labels to sign off on the product, which isn\u2019t shocking, considering that those that own the rights to music aren\u2019t too keen to give it away for even cheaper prices than they already are. While other big companies in the streaming music space have failed to be able", "Parents of successful kids have these 12 things in common. And while there isn't a set recipe for raising successful children, psychology research has pointed to a handful of factors that predict success. Unsurprisingly, much of it comes down to the parents. Here's what parents of successful kids have in common: They make their kids do chores \"If kids aren't doing the dishes, it means someone else is doing that for them,\" Julie Lythcott-Haims, former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and author of \"How to Raise an Adult\" said during a TED Talks Live event.  \"And so they're absolved of not only the work, but of learning that work has to be done and that each one of us must contribute for the betterment of the whole,\" she said.  Lythcott-Haims believes kids raised on chores go on to become employees who collaborate well with their coworkers, are more empathetic because they know firsthand what struggling looks like, and are able to take on tasks independently.   She bases this on the Harvard Grant Study, the longest longitudinal study ever conducted. \"By making them do chores \u2014 taking out the garbage, doing their own laundry \u2014 they realize I have to do the work of life in order", "This man went abroad and brought back a disease doctors had never seen. Lying in a hospital bed at the State Department medical unit in Washington, D.C., Claude Reece suspected he might have contracted malaria. It was 1995 and the American was sent back to the U.S. after coming down with a fever, sweats, pounding stomach aches and headaches, while on his first assignment working as a USAID country desk officer for Chad. \"I felt that whatever ailment I contracted could be treated by the Medical Unit,\" Reece told The Huffington Post \u2015 that\u2019s why he had been sent back to Washington. But the malaria test came back negative. Instead, the doctors told Reece a blood test revealed he had contracted Human African trypanosomiasis or \"sleeping sickness.\" The disease is caused by parasites transmitted by infected tsetse flies. And it\u2019s 100 percent fatal if untreated. The doctors told Reece they had never come across anyone with the disease before. They told him they had no medications to give him. \"I thought I was going to die,\" Reece said. \"I told my wife that. I told my children that. I told everybody that.\" \"We prayed,\" he added.

Hamilton is a music critic for Slate and a professor of American Studies and Media Studies at the University Of Virginia, and his criticism and academic rigor are all over Just Around Midnight. This is an academic book \u2014 Harvard University Press published it \u2014 but Hamilton writes with a conversational immediacy that makes it profoundly readable; I finished most of it on a single train ride last week. Hamilton writes about the most constantly discussed artists in popular music history \u2014 the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Hendrix \u2014 in ways that make their music sound new. And the story he tells is a sweeping and troubling one, a real warning about how white cultural imperialism can just completely plunder some of the most vital art in the world.

This week U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson sentenced him to eight months\u2019 home detention and 24 months\u2019 probation, in addition to the fine.

And yet the vegetable American toddlers are most likely to eat is a french fry. Child health advocates gathered on Capitol Hill Wednesday to mark the release of a new report, \"The First 1,000 Days: Nourishing America\u2019s Future,\" which documents the scourge of malnutrition in the U.S. 1,000 Days, a nonprofit that advocates nationally and globally for better early nutrition, produced the report, which highlights the economic gap that prevents many families from meeting some of the World Health Organization\u2019s basic nutritional standards. The report highlights a number of factors: Nearly half of U.S. women gain an excessive amount of weight during pregnancy, which can lead to higher rates of obesity in children. And only 22 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed to 6 months, which the WHO recommends due to breastmilk\u2019s unparalleled nutritional properties. Those deficiencies are largely due to a lack of institutional support, as less than half of moms receive any paid time off after childbirth, limiting their ability to breastfeed. The report also found that at least 40 percent of parents introduce solid foods and sugary drinks to their children too early, and one in four toddlers don\u2019t receive enough iron in their diet.

The Terminator star - who was in the country to promote the multi-sport festival and expo Arnold Classic Africa 2016 - had a terrifying encounter with the mammal when it blocked the road in front of his group's car, before walking around the vehicle and chasing it as it drove away, reported femalefirst.co.uk. He shared a video of the incident on YouTube on Tuesday and wrote, \"I couldn't have written this safari encounter better if it was a movie\". The clip shows the driver shutting off the engine to avoid scaring the elephant, but when he turns the car back on the animal, it bellowed and backed away. One passenger was heard asking, \"Is he backing up because of the engine?\" The driver tried to reassure his passengers by saying he is worried about the animal scratching the vehicle, but Schwarzenegger, 68, replied, \"No, he's going to charge us\". As the car sped away with the elephant behind, the actor could be heard exclaiming, \"Oh s**t\".

We've been brought some new information on the trip, which we now gather was a hunt. The hunt was for a young cancer sufferer who wanted to fulfill a last wish of catching a 100 kilo boar with his dogs. One of the people on the trip, Greg Bloom, said: One day while hunting one of the highly trained dogs was chasing some pigs by scent and collided with a big buck kangaroo that then held and wrestled the dog by its protective gear (boars have tusks like knives), the owner was horrified that his dog or the kangaroo would get hurt and run in to save both parties. You can see the dog trying to escape, wanting nothing to do with the kangaroo. The big buck kangaroo releases the dog when the owner gets close but then moves in to try and attack the human. A kangaroo kick to the guts could easily disembowel the owner easily, so he backs off a couple of times giving the kangaroo some space but he eventually changes the 'roo's mind with a punch to the snout, as it kept coming forward.

Maternal marijuana use isn\u2019t a risk factor A team lead by Dr. Shayna Conner set out to determine whether or not prenatal cannabis use is associated with negative health consequences. They performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that compared rates of cannabis consumption to birth outcomes. It is unethical to perform potentially harmful health experiments on pregnant women, so the majority of research on cannabis and pregnancy are observational and cell line studies. After examining all of the data, the team found two primary outcomes popped up consistently: low birth weight and preterm delivery. Those who oppose cannabis use often use these two potential impacts as an argument against the herb. However, this new study found something interesting. After sorting out tobacco use and other confounding factors, the researchers found no statistical correlation between cannabis use and any negative birth outcome. This lead them to conclude, Maternal marijuana use during pregnancy is not an independent risk factor for adverse neonatal outcomes after adjusting for confounding factors. Thus, the association between maternal marijuana use and adverse outcomes appears attributable to concomitant tobacco use and other confounding factors.

By Corrie Pikul You're Achy, You're Sore, and You Have No Idea Why It feels like muscle pain, but unlike a tight hamstring that makes you yelp when you stand up, your ache isn't triggered by a particular movement, and you can feel it in different places at various times. The culprit could be your fascia (pronounced \"fash-ya\"), says Mary Ann Wilmarth, DPT, chief of physical therapy at Harvard University Health Services. This sheet of tissue, made up of densely packed protein fibers, weaves throughout the entire body, and it binds and supports your muscles, bones and even your organs. While bodywork specialists have been passionate about fascia for decades, Wilmarth says it took new research on how fascia and muscles work together (some of it presented at the first international fascia research conference at Harvard in 2007) to get different health pros -- from orthopedists to MDs and pain experts to personal trainers -- to catch on.

Trump also promoted eleven of these so-called polls in a tweet, calling his wins in them \"such a great honor.\" But the things Trump called \"debate polls\" -- implying rigorous, scientific polling -- were informal web site surveys that invited anyone to respond. Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson told CNNMoney that the surveys are like \"junk food.\" Meaningful national polls seek a diverse sample of respondents. The goal is to accurately represent the views of the country by accounting for differences in age, gender, party affiliations and other factors. That's not possible when anonymous web users fill out online surveys. People choose whether to participate, and they can vote multiple times, further warping the results. The only thing these surveys can measure, to a limited degree, is enthusiasm -- and some Trump supporters are definitely enthusiastic. But political scientists and researchers say it is a mistake to read much more than that into unscientific survey results. Early Tuesday morning, former Obama strategist David Plouffe tweeted that the online surveys cited by Trump are simply \"bogus.\" Trump's proclivity for unscientific surveys was", "Things in the Olsen twins' lives that make no sense. With everything from their strange dating preferences, to some questionable business practices, to Mary-Kate's still-unexplained connection to the death of Heath Ledger, the Olsen twins have led bizarre lives since leaving the TGIF lineup. Though they've found massive success in an entirely separate business \u2014 the fashion world, and they've also become increasingly reclusive. And they don't smile. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here. There's a lot to unpack when it comes to the mysterious world of the Olsen twins, so let's dive right in and find out just how peculiar Mary-Kate and Ashley's lives have become. Banking on bad movies Yeah, Mary-Kate and Ashley made a lot of money splitting the role of Michelle Tanner on Full House (1987-1995), but they continued to rake in beaucoup bucks when the popular sitcom ended. Their net worth in 2018 was an estimated $400 million combined. How have these child stars remained rich when so many of their peers have struggled? The twins earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable direct-to-video movies \u2014 45 to be exact, according to Elle. Their most famous film, New York Minute (2004), earned a dismal 11 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes \u2013 and the bulk", "How David Brat Won. That contrast is a microcosm of the difference in sophistication between Cantor\u2019s campaign, and the insurgent challenge of Dave Brat, a relatively unknown economics professor from Randolph-Macon College. And it illustrates just how shocking it is that Brat was able to topple the majority leader after 13 years representing Virginia\u2019s conservative Seventh District in Washington.  In interviews here with Brat and Cantor allies, and Brat himself, a sketch of the insurgent\u2019s winning strategy emerges \u2014 and it runs completely counter to the conventional wisdom of this election cycle.  This year was branded as one where the establishment strikes back. In some places, it has \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) toppled his tea party challenger by running an aggressive campaign.  But people in Cantor and Brat\u2019s camps say that the majority leader struck back too hard.  Cantor\u2019s aides take pride in running a strong race against any candidate \u2014 Democrat or Republican. But the $2 million Cantor spent to brand Brat as a liberal professor may have had the reverse effect, people close to him and Brat say. It showed voters there was an alternative to Cantor -and that was exactly what many voters wanted. ", "40 Percent of Your Chicken Nugget Is Meat. The Rest Is... The implicit marketing pitch goes something like this: \"You like fried chicken, right? How about some bite-sized fried chicken chunks, without the messy bones?\" When most people think of eating chicken, they think of, say, biting into a drumstick. What they get when they do so is a mouthful of muscle\u2014popularly known as meat. Marketing isn't about giving people what they want; it's about convincing people to want what you've got\u2014that is, what you can buy cheap, spiff up, and sell at a profit. Take the chicken nugget, that staple of fast-food outlets and school lunches . One of them contained just 40 percent muscle. The rest? \"[G]enerous quantities of fat and other tissue, including connective tissue and bone spicules.\" Mmmm, chicken bones. The other sample had a whopping 50 percent muscle. The remainder consisted \"primarily of fat, with some blood vessels and nerve present,\" as well as epithelium, the stuff that glands are made of. Now why would national fast-food chains be mixing bone and fat and whatnot into the chicken meat they grind into nuggets? I doubt anyone ever woke up and thought, \"I'm craving some mechanically formed orbs of chicken parts, including meat, but also with plenty of", "6 transcendental festivals out in the middle of nowhere. some are about food or culture some are about just blowing off some steam built up at work or while studying. The holy grail though tends to be the ones aiming for a deeper experience, that reject the isolation of modern society and cherish togetherness. They're easy to scoff at, but while cynics are sat at their desks mocking people trying to \"find themselves\", thousands are having legitimately moving and profound experiences that might actually make them reassess how they choose to live their everyday life. Here we round up some global options when it comes to festivals you really have to commit to: BOOM \u2013 Portugal Taking place every two years beside a lake, BOOM celebrates the full moon with a psychedelic maelstrom of events encouraging people to converge and experience an alternative reality.

UPDATE: Nintendo has suggested that another Direct presentation will be held before the NX is revealed. Nintendo's Andrew Collins told Game Skinny that a soon to be announced Nintendo Direct will be held to discuss Animal Crossing: New Leaf's big new update. With the company likely to unveil the NX during a Direct presentation, his comments suggest fans will have to wait until after the Animal Crossing conference to find out more about the upcoming console. Asked about future Nintendo Direct conferences, Collins said: \"Nintendo Directs are actually presented to the communications teams much closer to their release. \"What I can tell you is that we have a to-be-announced Nintendo Direct that will be discussing the new Animal Crossing: New Leaf update coming out soon. \"I think it's important that we show this to the fans as we do hope to bring new content to older games in the future.\" ORIGINAL: A potential Nintendo NX price leak has hinted at an imminent console reveal.

Sometimes, increasing your productivity level isn't about working faster. It's about getting better organized, so you'll be able to do more in less time and with less stress. Here's how. Determine your key activities for the week. Sit down in a quiet location for 15-20 minutes and plan your week ahead. Write down the key projects and tasks you need or want to accomplish. Consider all the important meetings you're already scheduled to attend. What prep time will you need? For many people, the best times to do this planning is on Friday afternoon or at some point during the weekend. For anyone who gets anxious on Sunday evenings or on Monday mornings thinking about their work week, this short planning period can help alleviate some of those feelings of worry. Block your calendar. Schedule the time you'll need to complete your high-priority tasks and projects. Also, be sure to block any time you'll want to prep for important meetings so you can walk in feeling ready for the discussions. I like to think of this exercise as a way of taking back my time, so I'm better prepared to say No to some requests, delegate others, and push other requests", "Guess where Twitter founder @Jack Dorsey is taking his entrepreneurial vision. \"I love what entrepreneurship stands for,\" Dorsey said in an interview with The Huffington Post this week. \"You want to see something in the world, and you do whatever it takes to make it exist.\" Dorsey was in Detroit on Tuesday for a series on local entrepreneurship called \"Let's Talk\" sponsored by Square, a company that makes a device for business owners to accept credit card payments on their phones and tablets and where he serves as CEO. He isn't the only tech entrepreneur who sees potential -- or money to be made -- in the bankrupt Motor City. That same day, Dorsey was also booked to speak at Techonomy Detroit, a spinoff of the startup-booster business conference founded by journalist David Kirkpatrick. Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert, Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (the former chairman of Gateway) also took the stage at Techonomy to declare that tech industry entrepreneurs can accelerate the city's comeback. Twitter already opened a small office in Detroit last year, and a dozen startup companies (many bankrolled by Gilbert's venture fund) have rented office space downtown.

Abrams has recently leveraged a number of entertainment projects to raise awareness about pressing global issues. When he began working on \"Revolution,\" a television show that takes place 15 years after a global blackout, Abrams decided to use the opportunity to learn more about plaguing issues and to educate his viewers about them, he said at the event. His writers met with five UN specialists to learn about a number of issues, including warlords -- a topic that will play more of an integral role in the series' second season. \"We really wanted to deepen our connection with the world around us, and to take these entertainment opportunities and make them into something that was even deeper and more meaningful,\" Abrams said. \"And even in a few months it\u2019s brought a deeper level of meaning to our work.\" Abrams also applied the same kind of social-good approach to inspiring his viewers when he set out to work on \"Star Trek Into Darkness.\" Since the movie was set to be released in", "Plus-size \"Top Model\" winner lands MAJOR gig.

All five of our experts give red wine a purple-stained smile. At 125 calories for a five-ounce pour, it's a lighter choice than beer and mixed drinks, says Julia Zumpano , a dietitian at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Heart & Vascular Institute. And yes, it's got more antioxidants, too\u2014including resveratrol, that famous compound billed as the miracle in chocolate and vino. But recent research has given resveratrol the side eye as the reason for wine's healthy glow. The aptly-named inCHIANTI study, a 16-year-long look at the blood, urine and dietary questionnaires of hundreds of people living in the Italian wine-making region of Chianti, recently found that resveratrol wasn't associated with disease or lifespan, to the shock and dismay of wine lovers everywhere. But that doesn't mean red wine does nothing for you\u2014just that resveratrol might not be compound that deserves all the credit. \"Many studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption, especially wine, is associated with lower cardiovascular disease and mortality compared with both no alcohol consumption or consumption above moderate,\" says Luigi Ferrucci , founder of the inCHIANTI study and now scientific director of the National Institute on Aging. \"The mechanism of this association is not clear, and", "Why Stephen Colbert is taking a pay cut for \u2018The Late Show\u2019. While the exact details of Colbert\u2019s contract haven\u2019t been disclosed, if the reported $4.6 million per year for a three-year deal with CBS is accurate, that would actually be a decrease from the 51-year-old entertainer's reported $6 million salary at the end of his tenure on Comedy Central\u2019s The Colbert Report . That puts Colbert on the low end of the late-night salary spectrum: Jimmy Fallon takes home a reported $11 to $12 million as host of NBC\u2019s The Tonight Show ; Jimmy Kimmel earns $10 million for Jimmy Kimmel Live! ; and Conan O'Brien enjoyed a $12 million salary last year as host of Conan on TBS. Then there are the retired titans: before turning over their shows, David Letterman made $30 million some years as host of The Late Show, while Jay Leno took home $20 to $25 million a year on The Tonight Show. And of course, nothing comes close to the $25 million Johnny Carson earned in 1980\u2014the equivalent of roughly $72 million today when adjusted for inflation. While the move to CBS will certainly elevate the late-night talker in the public consciousness, Colbert will first have to prove he can make the network money before before", "The 'Human Barbie' Is Shedding Her Doll-Like Image For Something More Powerful. It can be hard to find out where you want to be in life. For most of us, the world seems so large, with so many passions and lifestyles to choose from. So it's difficult to focus on only a few avenues to fully explore. Even if you grow up with a clear idea of what you want to be, the world doesn't always work out that way. Sure, it's common to never quite get where you want to end up, but it's not uncommon to find it unsatisfying when you do make it.

Sayreville War Memorial High School's football team canceled its season this month following allegations of hazing and sexual assault. Seven players on the Sayreville, New Jersey team have been linked to the alleged hazing of four students over a span of 10 days in September. One incident allegedly involved anal sexual attacks, NJ.com reported. Rivals.com first disclosed Penn State has decided against recruiting Myles Hartsfield, a senior at Sayreville who verbally committed to the university. Hartsfield planned to sign a letter of intent in the coming months, MyCentralJersey.com reported. Police have not released the names of the seven juveniles ages 15 to 17 who were charged over the weekend in connection with the hazing, according to NJ.com. However, police were spotted at Hartsfield's residence on Friday night shortly before the announcement of formal charges against the teenagers. Three of the seven minors arrested are charged with \"aggravated sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, conspiracy to commit aggravated criminal sexual contact, criminal restraint, and hazing for engaging in an act of sexual penetration upon one of the juvenile victims.\" The other four are charged \"with various counts including aggravated assault, conspiracy, aggravated criminal sexual contact, hazing and riot by participating in the", "The one health factor we're still ignoring. Dr. Elaine Ferguson, author of Superhealing, says most of us aren't tuning in enough to our emotional health -- and we're suffering as a result. Ferguson recently told HuffPost Live host Nancy Redd that while physical health is important, there is too much emphasis placed on the body and not enough on the mind and spirit. \"There was too much of a focus on physical health and well-being, and not enough encompassing of the mind and spirit as well,\" Ferguson said. \"When I became a physician I had a couple of illnesses that were chronic and quite severe, and when I was in the hospital I realized that my emotional health was definitely impacting my physical body and I made a decision to take charge of that and to do some things that I knew I needed to do.\" According to Ferguson, it is important for us to connect the mind and the body -- and the first step to achieving that connection is through simple focus. \"One of the first things you can do is to pay attention to what's going on,\" she said. \"We're so externally-focused in this world, we don't pay attention to our inner voice and the", "These are the most beautiful women in the world, according to a new poll.

What Transformers 5 May Be About By Dirk Libbey At this point, there simply shouldn't be anything that surprises you when it comes to the plot for Transformers movies. They're about giant robots who turn into cars and planes, so it's not like incorporating Arthurian legend into the mix really makes the premise that much more bizarre, does it? How the human characters, played by Mark Wahlberg, and a returning Josh Duhamel, will fit into all this is unclear. The fact that those details appear to be missing from this plot would appear to indicate that the rumors that the franchise would be moving toward focusing more on the robots and less on the people may be true. A number of previously appearing Transformers have also been announced for Transformers: The Last Knight, though, if you're actually capable of telling them all apart, you're a better man than I. The film is currently filming in Cuba. While seeing a new Transformers movie is probably not something on your bucket list, the fifth entry in the franchise is on the way, so we'd better all just get used to the idea.

It should, then, be the perfect Olympic city too, a sporting mecca in a continent that has never hosted an Olympic Games. So why, with just 30 days to go, are people so concerned about what might happen? With people both inside Brazil and around the world in desperate need for something to cheer about, why are there so many worried frowns? And can anything be done to save the successor to London 2012? Are the Rio Olympic venues ready? Rio 2016 is split across four different zones across the city. The largest, the Olympic Park in Barra, just west of Rio, is, to put it graciously, a work in progress. When we visit, just a week before the BBC and the rest of the world's media are due to move in, the area is an open expanse of concrete, lorries and white tents surrounding venues that are supposedly complete, but in reality still have plenty of work to do.

Elites in the West are in trouble. Their careful curation of the polity and economy is coming badly unstuck. Their credibility in delivering consumerist goodies is shattering. They have worked so assiduously to eliminate and denigrate all alternative social models that the frustration people now feel has no where to go, no reasoned idiom in which to express itself, so it comes out all over the place. This is what a dark age feels like. The only alternative grand narrative to the liberal market that withstood its celebratory march was nationalism. Especially after 9/11, nationalism of a particularly conservative kind was consistently mobilized by elites in the West in order to create the conditions for an aggressive foreign policy and as a complement to the panglossian idea that unfettered markets created the best of all worlds. Nationalism and neoliberalism were mutually reinforcing up to the point where capitalism continued to deliver the goodies. Once the goose stopped laying those eggs, this dynamic became antagonistic. This is what we are seeing today. There is an old trope in left politics that the working class fail to act and vote in their own interest thanks to the smoke-screen of nationalism.

Charles Williams II, president of the Michigan chapter of the National Action Network, made the comment at a press conference and bottled water handout in Flint Monday, NBC 25 reports. \"This is almost as bad as gas chambers for Jews,\" Williams said. In a follow-up with FOX 2, Williams said forcing Flint residents to buy bad water is \"just as unjust as slavery. That's just as unjust as genocide. An injustice is an injustice.\" Issues with water quality in Flint stretch back to last year, but were made official in January when residents were notified that the city was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Water tested at the end of 2014 contained unacceptable levels of trihalomethanes (TTHM), chemicals that are a byproduct of chlorine. At the time, the city said water was safe to drink, but advised the elderly, parents of infants and anyone with a \"severely compromised immune system\" to consult a doctor because they may be at increased risk. The chlorine that led to an overabundance of TTHM chemicals was used as a disinfectant; Flint increased the level of chlorine in its drinking water last year to fight bacteria.

Warren recounts one such meeting with an unnamed House Democrat in her new book, A Fighting Chance. I remember one meeting particularly well. A congresswoman who seemed really interested in what we had to say told me that she supported consumers and wanted to see them treated fairly. Then she raised a specific objection to the agency. I answered, but instead of talking about the issue, she moved on to another objection, and so on through a list of about half a dozen more problems. Despite her many objections, I felt a little encouraged. Once Dan and I were out in the hall, I said, \"Well, she didn't agree with much of anything, but at least she was talking. Maybe we have a shot at persuading her.\" For a moment, Dan looked like he was weighing whether to give me the bad news. But Dan never holds back long on bad news.

Since starting Roc Nation Sports, a new agency with marquee signings like Robinson Cano, Kevin Durant and Victor Cruz, the rapper and mogul had already begun offloading his stake in the Nets organization. (He sold his one-fifteenth of one percent to head coach Jason Kidd for $500,000.) Interestingly, his ownership in the center itself is proving to be far more valuable. According to the New York Times, Jay Z owns a little less than one-fifth of one percent of the venue, a stake that's currently valued at about $1.5 million (the whole venue has a potential worth of $741 million). According to Forbes, however, Jay's share could actually be worth significantly more, given the overwhelming success of the Brooklyn venue. UPDATE: Roc Nation disputed Forbes' report, though the company didn't indicate which part (Is he selling his share and just getting less? Is he not selling at all?). Jay Z, who officially announced that he was leaving the Nets in April, has used his ownership in the team and the venue as brag points in songs and responded to criticism that he's over-stating his importance in the organization given his status as a very minority owner. \"It doesn't matter what percentage,\"", "As is tradition.

First, let\u2019s run through all of the rumors that have been flying around the internet. Many people have reported seeing Moltres, especially. One person has reported seeing Articuno\u2019s silhouette with three footsteps next to it so far. Nobody that I know of has reported seeing Zapdos or the Mew twins in the wild. The biggest Mew twins rumor out there centers around the idea that Mewtwo can be found in Times Square. This stems from an old trailer for Poke\u0301mon GO that was released which involved players gathering in Times Square, with Mewtwo spawning across all of their phones. They teamed up to face Mewtwo and then they all caught him. That was just for the trailer, though. Mewtwo has not been spawned in the wild yet and according to the developer Niantic, none of them have. That is because Niantic has to manually spawn the legendaries. The legendaries, unlike the common and even rare Poke\u0301mon that permeate the rest of the game, do not show up unless they are manually made to show up. So the way to get the legendaries is to wait for a special event to happen, and if Niantic\u2019s prior game Ingress is any indication, there", "What Marco Rubio would need to do to win. The Map Mr. Rubio hopes to compete in all four of the early nominating contests, and will need to finish first in at least one, or come close in a number of them, to be considered viable.

His operatives include several people from South Carolina, giving him useful connections in that state. He spent his formative years in Nevada, a heavily Hispanic state, and has relatives there.

JMU is just the latest school in Virginia to face federal and public scrutiny over its handling of sexual violence, and alumni are noting they raised nearly identical concerns 20 years ago. But state lawmakers have remained largely silent, even as three public institutions are under federal investigation. Four universities in Virginia are currently being investigated by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights for possible Title IX violations specifically related to sexual violence -- JMU, the University of Virginia, the College of William & Mary and the University of Richmond. Two other schools in the state, the Virginia Military Institute and Virginia Commonwealth University, faced Title IX reviews that concluded this spring. JMU's case is based on a complaint from a student who has since withdrawn from the university. The school found three men guilty of sexual assaulting her, and guilty of harassment for spreading video of the incident around campus. The school punished them with \"expulsion after graduation.\" \"A finding of responsible, but with expulsion after graduation, is not a just decision in this case,\" Tammy Castle, an associate professor of justice studies at JMU, told The Huffington Post. \"Students have been suspended for drinking offenses, and", "How Portland's new school dress code could change the high school experience forever. If you thought the days of getting kicked out of class for wearing a skirt shorter than the length of your fingertips were over\u2014think again. Girls all over the country get \"dress-coded\" every day for wearing tank tops or shorts deemed too short by teachers and school administrators. Why? Because showing all that skin is \"distracting\" for boys. *Insert dramatic eye roll here* That\u2019s why Portland, Oregon middle schooler Sophia Carlson took a stand last year and challenged her school\u2019s dress code policy. She and her friends, who attended Irvington School, had been kept out of class for dress code violations one too many times. \"It\u2019s a very embarrassing and shaming moment, to get dress-coded,\" said Carlson, now 14, in an interview with Bitch. \"The loss of educational time disproportionately targets girls.\" Carlson and other advocates proposed changes to the district\u2019s dress code that would make it less restrictive overall and, more importantly, gender-neutral.

Justice Samuel Alito and his wife Martha-Ann showed up on Sunday at Heirloom, a popular New Haven, Connecticut, brunch spot. But the couple was reportedly turned away by a hostess, who said the restaurant was full. The hostess didn't change her tune even after a bystander told her that the guest she'd just refused to seat was a Supreme Court justice. \"Well, he should have made a reservation. We get very busy for brunch,\" she said, according to legal blog Above the Law. But let's not rush to blame the hostess. As it turns out, many people have trouble identifying Supreme Court justices. Polls have shown that a whopping two-thirds of Americans can't name a single justice -- let alone recognize one when he waltzes in sans reservation. In a 2010 Pew Research Center survey, a paltry 28 percent of respondents were able to identify John Roberts as chief justice. Alito, who was visiting his alma mater to receive an Award of Merit along with fellow Yale Law School alumni Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor, reacted calmly to missing out on zucchini falafel eggs Benedict and blistered gypsy peppers.

In the new beta, if you've touched the lockscreen at all, using Touch ID will unlock the phone, but not open it.

The announcement was a surprise. Although scrutiny of CS:GO gambling peaked as it was revealed that two of the world\u2019s most popular gaming YouTubers had created a CS:GO skin gambling website and quietly promoted it to their audiences, some of these services have existed for three years . Other than a match fixing scandal in 2015 this was the first time that Valve has addressed them. The drop in price seems reactionary, a reflection of some sellers\u2019 fear that the market would implode. Valve\u2019s announcement implied that Steam users should retrieve item skins from gambling websites, and some members of the community began to wonder: would Valve\u2019s action trigger a crash of CS:GO\u2019s skin market? Some Steam users own hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of CS:GO skins. How would their fortunes, and the inventory value of CS:GO\u2019s other 10 million active players, be affected by this announcement? Not much. Although there isn\u2019t an index number that reflects the value of the CS:GO item market as a whole, sales data for individual weapons tend to show an initial reaction to the news, followed by normalization.

Editor\u2019s Note: Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76. This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Stephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century. The famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system\u2014which he operates with his cheek\u2014and have around-the-clock care. But his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology. But like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular.

Some of the major problems with using buzzwords, according to Mary Lorenz, a corporate-communications manager at CareerBuilder, are that they have become so overused that they've lost all meaning, and they don't differentiate the job seeker from other candidates because they're so generic. Other, less jargony words and terms should be avoided when they serve little purpose to the hiring manager. All these words do is waste space and the reader's time and, as a result, you lose out on the few precious seconds a recruiter spends scanning your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Instead, Lorenz says job seekers should speak in terms of accomplishments and show rather than tell. \"Avoiding overused terms can help job seekers convey their message and stand out from the crowd,\" McDonald says. Here are some words and phrases you should avoid: 1. 'Leadership' According to LinkedIn, \"leadership\" was the top buzzword on its user's profiles.

The twist is that \"Dirty Paws\" was released in April of 2012 as the second single off their debut studio album, \"My Head Is an Animal.\" Without much radio support or, as Billboard reports, even a radio campaign, the song didn't really make much of an impact outside the band's fanbase. Things have changed: Republic Records and Universal Music Group are now looking to capitalize on the \"Walter Mitty\" sunlight and may work the song for radio, more than a year after its original release. More good news for Of Monsters and Men: The song not only underscores the entire trailer, it's also appearing in the movie itself. As we've previously noted, many trailers use songs that aren't in the movies the previews are promoting. \"We Found Love\" works well in the trailer for \"Magic Mike\" but doesn't appear in the film, and the same goes for M.I.A.'s \"Paper Planes\" and \"Pineapple Express.\" A gallery of further examples is available below.

At first, investors didn't appear too pleased with Sunny Optical Technology Group Co.'s 77 percent increase in second-half 2016 net income. But now the maker of smartphone cameras seems to have been forgiven. Despite beating estimates, Sunny Optical's Hong Kong-traded stock tumbled 4 percent on Tuesday. Much of that was recouped in early trading on Wednesday, amid volumes about 1.7 times the 20-day average. To put those moves in context, Sunny's 66 percent rise this year -- including a 10.4 percent pop on Friday before the results -- makes it the best performer in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Investors have been betting that strong demand and higher prices for dual-lens cameras would drive earnings. Which they did. They also know that what goes up must come down, so the debate being played out this week is whether now is the time for a fall, or whether there's more room for growth. If anyone was looking for an excuse to sell after the company released earnings late Monday, they found it in the fact that Sunny's strongest sales growth in two years was below estimates.

First, working with Maddock Douglas, a Chicago consulting firm, we surveyed 1,014 sports fans across North America in July to find out what you want most in return for the emotion, money and time you invest in MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL clubs. Our poll covered 25 topics, from \"has honest ownership\" to \"connects me to information I want about the team online or via mobile devices.\" Second, through ESPN.com and NetReflector, a Seattle opinion research company, we asked fans to rate their favorite franchises in each of", "She Boiled Watermelon Seeds For A Reason I\u2019d Never Heard Of. You may recall being explicitly told as child to not eat watermelon seeds or you may end up growing the gigantic fruit in your stomach. If you were anything like me you may have spent a good amount of time plucking each seed out before munching on the delicious treat. You don\u2019t have to stop taking each seed out but instead of throwing them out, use them. Watermelon seeds are packed with nutrients that are beneficial and healthy for you. The small seeds resemble sunflower seeds in look and flavour. And it\u2019s easy to eat them as a standalone snack or add them to your salads and tea.

A new study from the market research firm Affinnova suggests that liquor bottles also act as potent billboards, able to alter our conception of a brand's \"personality.\" The study split 500 U.S.-based vodka drinkers into two equal groups. Half judged the personalities of vodkas based on the brand's name, and half based on its bottle. In the mix were Absolut, Belvedere, Smirnoff, Ketel One, Skyy (using a limited run bottle), Tito\u2019s, Stolichnaya, Svedka, Grey Goose, Ciroc, Pinnacle and New Amsterdam. The two groups ranked each brand in categories like \"sexy,\" \"genuine,\" \"fun\" and \"celebratory.\" The respondents dealing with brand name alone deemed Absolut the most \"sexy\" -- not surprising, considering the sophisticated ad war the Swedish company has waged for decades. But respondents looking at its bottle -- which, while iconic, is also relatively squat and covered in text -- ranked the brand sixth sexiest, out of twelve. The winner of this sexiness contest? Skyy, based on its stark cobalt blue bottle. The brand on the left is not as sexy. In a statement, Affinnova explained the gap in the two assessments on complacency on the part of older brands. Established brands state their", "'Please value life'. Perhaps veterinarian and animal lover Chien Chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time. \"She often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better,\" Winnie Lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in Taoyuan City, remembers. As a graduate of Taiwan's top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, Ms Chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in Taiwan. The shelter's lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by Ms Chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down. On 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals. She said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in Taiwan. Taiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short. But people also asked why frontline workers in Taiwan's battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure.

The launch of the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket\u2014aimed at transporting supplies to the International Space Station\u2014is scheduled for a 30-minute window beginning at 11:11 a.m. ET. The 360-degree livestream will be accessible on the NASA Television YouTube channel starting 10 minutes prior to liftoff. While the minimum safe viewing distance is typically miles away from the launch pad, this livestream promises viewers a much closer look at a powerful rocket launch, or what NASA is calling a \"pads-eye view.\" The rocket will be carrying a Cygnus spacecraft made by Orbital ATK, with more than 7,600 pounds of scientific research, crew supplies, and other materials destined for the orbiting laboratory.

Utech was a senior adviser to former Energy Secretary Steven Chu before joining the White House, and before that worked for the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee. He also served as an energy policy adviser for Hillary Clinton when she was a senator. Utech's appointment comes at a critical time in the implementation of Obama's climate plan, which was announced in June and has rolled out through a series of executive and agency actions.

After busting through an enclosure, the nimble contortionist appears to have quietly crossed the floor, slithered through a narrow drain hole about six inches in diameter and jumped into the sea. Then he disappeared. This was no Houdini, but rather a common New Zealand octopus called Inky, about the size of a soccer ball. The breakout at the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, which has captured the imagination of New Zealanders and made headlines around the world, apparently began when Inky slipped through a small gap at the top of his tank. Octopus tracks suggest he then scampered eight feet across the floor and slid down a 164-foot-long drainpipe that dropped him into Hawke\u2019s Bay, on the east coast of North Island, according to reports in New Zealand\u2019s news media. The aquarium\u2019s keepers noticed the escape when they came to work and discovered that Inky was not in his tank. A less independence-minded octopus, Blotchy, remained behind. The aquarium\u2019s manager, Rob Yarrall, told Radio New Zealand that employees had searched the aquarium\u2019s pipes after discovering Inky\u2019s trail, to no avail. The escape happened several months ago, but it only recently came to light. \"He managed to make his way", "5 Things to Watch at Monday Night's Clinton-Trump Debate. With national polls showing a tight race just six weeks out from Election Day, the Hofstra University fight offers one of the last chances for each to speak directly to the tens millions of voters who are expected to tune in. For Clinton, a veteran debater, one of her biggest challenges will be both to provoke Trump and avoid being provoked by him, while delivering an earnest and candid performance. And for Trump, who had uneven and at times explosive debate performances during the Republican primary, his first one-on-one debate presents a serious test of his ability to stay on script and keep his cool. Here are five things to watch at Monday night's debate: Which Donald Trump will show up? During the long Republican primary, there was no telling which Trump would show up to a debate. Sometimes it was the combative and hostile Trump -- quick to throw punches and go after his opponents with personal attacks. Other times, it was an uncharacteristically subdued Trump, content to disappear from the spotlight for long stretches of time and let his competitors command the stage and attack one another. \"We are preparing for different Trumps that might show up,\" Clinton spokeswoman", "Scientists Discover How \"Lucy\" Died, Solving 3.2-Million-Year-Old Detective Puzzle. A remarkable new Nature study has shed some additional light on Lucy\u2019s demise. Despite being one of the most complete fossilized hominin skeletons ever found, it\u2019s not been entirely clear how she died, making her one of the oldest cold cases in prehistory. After a painstaking analysis of all her fractures, however, it appears she died falling out of a tree, outstretching her arms in an attempt to save herself as she took her final tumble. \"Up until this time, no one had ever before proposed a cause of death for Lucy,\" lead author John Kappelman , professor of hominoid paleobiology and evolution at the University of Texas at Austin, told IFLScience. As fascinating as this is by itself, it also appears to confirm something that some researchers have hypothesized for a while now: Lucy wasn\u2019t just a ground-walker, but arboreal \u2013 a tree-climber. Her death, therefore, probably came about because, unlike her ancestors, she could not climb trees as well anymore, and slipped and fell. \"Our new hypothesis offers indirect support for this idea,\" Kappelman added. \"How much time, and how frequently did the climbing occur, well, we don\u2019t know at present. But let\u2019s assume for a moment that Lucy", "Rahul Gandhi tweeted about his #vacation and this is what followed. So RaGa went on a vacation and took it to twitter to declare his holiday plans.

Not like he asked for it, but the man just can't escape the wrath of Indians, regardless of whatever he does. In the past, also, Rahul Gandhi has been in the news for missing two major events where his party needed him the most.

In fact, even now, it's quite a critical time for him to take a vacation, but, who's to say?", "New study reveals one awesome upside to being short. We've long known that short people live longer than the taller among us. Past studies have examined the relationship between height and lifespan of populations around the world, suggesting that shorter people generally live longer lives, while taller people are more likely to have certain illnesses and develop various types of cancer. Now, thanks to new research published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers have finally discovered the secret behind shorter people's longevity: It's in their genes. Using data from a long-term observational study of Japanese-American men in Hawaii, researchers demonstrated that a gene linked to longevity, called FOXO3, is also linked to body size. What's more, researchers found that the shorter a person was, the more likely they were to have a long life. In one of the world's largest and longest-running studies of aging men, researchers at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine, Kuakini Medical Center and U.S. Veterans Affairs ran an analysis by dividing more than 8,000 subjects into two height groups -- 5'2\" and shorter and 5'4\" and taller -- and looking at their heights, health and death rates over a 40 year period. \"The folks who were 5'2\" and shorter lived the", "What would happen if Trump quit? According to ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl, GOP pooh-bahs are so alarmed by Donald Trump\u2019s post-convention behavior and the chaotic atmosphere inside his campaign that they are looking into what would happen if the wiggy dude actually withdrew from the presidential contest. For the record, I think such speculation is almost certainly the product of wish projection by the many Republican elected officials who devoutly desire that Trump would just go away and let them reclaim \"their\" party in the name of conservative ideology or old-school Chamber of Commerce values or whatever. We\u2019ve heard about his demise too many times to overreact to every report that his candidacy is dead or dying, particularly after a mere four or five days of disastrous missteps. But just for grins, let\u2019s take a quick look at what would happen if Trump announced he was canceling his presidential campaign like it was a summer TV show gone bad.

America is facing an overwhelming trend of mac n' cheese being added to foods that simply do not need macaroni and cheese. On Thursday, Red Robin announced it had added mac n' cheese to the chain's tavern burger. \"Begin drooling now!\" the burger chain ordered on Twitter. The new menu item comes less than a week after Dave & Buster's short rib and cheese mac stack was named one of the least healthy menu items in America , clocking in at 1,910 calories.

A friend once grumbled that, given the choice, she\u2019d rather see her ex miserable than herself happy. Few things in life are as traumatic as the end of a long-term, romantic relationship.

Why is it that some people continue to be haunted by the ghosts of their romantic pasts, struggling to let go of the pain of rejection?

An electronic cigarette or similar device; an act of inhaling and exhaling the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device. Editors at Oxford found that use of the word has doubled in 2014 over the prior year. It can also be traced back to the explosion of the electronic cigarette industry.which topped $1 billion in sales in 2013 according to Forbes. As the practice gained its own audience, a new word was needed to describe the trend, hence \"vape.\" \"As vaping has gone mainstream, with celebrities from Lindsay Lohan to Barry Manilow giving it a go, and with growing public debate on the public dangers and the need for regulation , so the language usage of the word 'vape' and related terms in 2014 has shown a marked increase,\" said Judy Pearsall, Editorial Director for Oxford Dictionaries on their website.

I just remember being happy.\u2019\" Despite her fame and success, Rowling writes that the single parent stigma persisted. \"There was still no escaping the Single Parent tag; it followed me to financial stability and fame just as it had clung to me in poverty and obscurity,\" she wrote. \"I became Single Parent Writes Award-Winning Children\u2019s Book/Earns Record American Advance/Gets Film Deal.\" Rowling went on to say that she is working with Gingerbread to enact policy changes that will positively impact the lives of single parents", "Pok\u00e9mon Go Has A Feature That Nobody Knows How To Use. So, for those who have been living somewhere under a rock in the middle of the Carribean sea, Pokemon Go came out last week and lots of people are playing it. It\u2019s been a huge hit, and people all over the world are currently enjoying catching Pokemon out in the real world. The game isn\u2019t overly complex, but then again, neither are its functions explained in great detail. One function in particular has been niggling at players, causing quite a great deal of annoyance. Problem is, it\u2019s one of the games most used features to boot. The \"Nearby\" function is theoretically supposed to show you the variety of Pokemon in the area that you\u2019re in, and your distance from each of them. Unless previously caught, only the silhouette of the Pokemon is shown (usually easily guessable however). The distance is represented by pawprints \u2013 the greater the number, the further away the Pokemon is. Now, you would think this feature would typically be one of, if the not the most, used while playing the game. The main point of being a Pokemon trainer is to \"catch \u2018em all\", after all. However, the feature developer Niantic have currently supplied players with is", "Woman Leaves Savage Surprise For Co-Worker Who Always Steals Her Coffee Creamer. Confused? Just wait. We need context. Hands up if you\u2019ve ever fallen victim to the phantom office thief. *Raises hand* You know, those stealthy weasels who somehow weave their way between desks, target the fridge and steal things. Normally it\u2019s milk. The more brazen go for food. And the lowest of the low nab things like birthday cakes someone\u2019s brought in for a friend\u2019s party after work. Seriously though, how are these people NEVER caught. If it wasn\u2019t so frustrating it would be impressive. Anyway. The thief we\u2019re talking about is a coffee creamer snatcher. And unfortunately for him, the owner was the sassiest of all co-workers: the new mom. She got revenge in the best way. Take a look at this piece of badassery: Oh man. Well played. Here\u2019s what it says if you can\u2019t read it: Good morning! To whomever has been enjoying my coffee creamer all week ... surprise!!! You\u2019ve been drinking my BREAST MILK. Hope you enjoyed.

Through the years I've quit dozens of times, to no avail. This, like any addiction, is a personal struggle. If you're an addict, no amount of disappointed friend-shaming, bummer chats with parents, or losses of potential girlfriends can make you do something you're not ready to do. I get it. Cigarettes are bad. And yet, despite all that I know about cigarettes and why they're bad, I still fucking like them. All of which brings me to my current situation. After trying for so long to quit, only to disappointingly flip between stopping and guiltily falling off the wagon, I've found a \"healthy\" medium, a half-happy place where I can smoke casually. Actually casually. It started a few months ago, when, feeling dangerously worn out for a 24-year-old, I quit smoking. I knew I wanted 2015 to be different, and I didn't want to wait until my New Year's Resolution to make it so. I joined a gym, changed my diet, and started exercising five times a week. Since November, I've kept it up, shedding some pounds and, more important, feeling better about myself as a human being. Part of this is due to the fact that, about a month into", "Is a rare birth defect actually helping American breaststrokers? Start from the ground up: Most successful breaststrokers have duck feet that point outward, making it all the easier to perform the frog kick that goes with the stroke. Flexible ankles are a plus. So is a long torso. But what if there is one other rare physical trait that lends itself to excellence in breaststroke? And what if that trait is a birth defect? It sounds crazy, and it might be nothing more than coincidence. But two of the three American Olympic breaststrokers here were born with a chest wall deformity, and a third elite American breaststroker has the same physical abnormality. Kevin Cordes, who was a finalist in the 100 breast earlier this week and finished eighth in the 200 breast final Wednesday night, has a condition known as pectus carinatum. It is characterized by a protrusion of the sternum and ribs. Cordes is, essentially, pigeon-chested. He had surgery in third grade to mitigate the appearance of it, leaving him more numb in the lower sternum. Teammate Cody Miller , the bronze medalist in the 100 breast, has the inverse effect: pectus excavatum. That\u2019s a sunken chest, where the ribs and sternum have grown inward.

Markov, a writer, journalist and opponent of Bulgaria's then communist regime, died on September 11, 1978 after a stranger shot a poisoned pellet into his leg. Prosecutors have failed to identify, arrest or charge anybody for the crime, known as the \"Bulgarian umbrella\". \"The probe will be abandoned as of tomorrow, when the absolute statute of limitations of 35 years will expire,\" the prosecutors' office spokeswoman Rumiana Arnaudova said. \"To overcome the statute of limitations, we need to have a suspect for the crime arrested, charged or put on a search list. As of the moment, we have not established the perpetrator and neither of the above actions are undertaken,\" Arnaudova said. British police have their own investigation of the affair. According to accounts of the incident, Markov, who defected to the West in 1969, was waiting for a bus when he felt a sharp sting in his thigh. A stranger fumbled behind him with an umbrella he had dropped and mumbled \"sorry\" before walking away. Markov died four days later of what is believed to be ricin poisoning, for which there is no antidote. Five years ago, the Bulgarian daily Dnevnik published an investigation into communist-era secret police files which", "Sex Q&amp;A: How safe are rim jobs, actually? Q: I have a partner who is infinitely giving in the sack. He rocks my socks off. He's always so busy doing things to/for me that I get too distracted to do much for him. I would love to change this. One thing he's mentioned once or twice is that he'd like a rim job. In theory I would love to do this if it would give him as much pleasure as he has given me, but I have a few hesitations. Namely, if it is safe/healthy to do this without a barrier. We are monogamous and I'm on the Pill so we don't otherwise use condoms or dental dams for any bedroom activities. My googling turns up many different answers from sexperts and normal people, and I don't know how to separate the information wheat from the chaff. The more cautious sources indicate that one should use a dental dam (with some lube on the receiver's side of the dam). Many other sources act like this is an unnecessarily uptight precaution and having a basically clean body is good enough. I'm not able to discern if the idea of using a dental dam in this scenario is like the recommendation", "Michelle Obama Claims the White House Was \u2018Built by Slaves\u2019...

While I think it\u2019s fair to say that our Founding Fathers never could have imagined this day... you are the fruits of their labor. Their legacy is very much your legacy.\" There\u2019s just one big problem with her statement, which has also been echoed by her husband: it\u2019s not entirely true. But don\u2019t expect the media to tell you why. the White House was not built solely \u2014 or even primarily \u2014 by slaves.

Every night for 20 years, Gino Rodriguez knelt beside his three daughters\u2019 beds and whispered an incantation. As rats the size of footballs skittered along the floor of the basement apartment on the South Side of Chicago, he repeated the same five words into each girl\u2019s ear as she slept: \"I can and I will.\" The message was always the same, and the audience was always asleep. \"You talk to the subconscious.

Meerkat got a harsh blow in March when Twitter blocked it from accessing its users to prioritize its own competing livestream service Periscope. Facebook, on the other hand, has been helpful \u2013 suggesting that the social network has no plans to build its own livestreaming app. It\u2019s also possible that Facebook sees Meerkat as a potential acquisition. The social network has a long list of successful targets like WhatsApp and Instagram. L2\u2019s Scott Galloway predicted in a recent talk that the latter would bring in $1.5 billion in revenue within three years, making it a \"great acquisition choice\" as young people drifted from Facebook to Instagram. This roster of acquisitions is just one reason that L2 is sticking to its 2011 prediction that Facebook \u2013 which just surpassed the value of Walmart \u2013 is set to become the most valuable company in the world. Another reason is Facebook\u2019s remarkable pivot to mobile. Three years ago, Facebook had yet to adapt to the growing predominance of mobile devices. Today, nearly $2.5 billion comes from mobile ads, accounting for 69% of total ad revenue. Facebook\u2019s native videos are also challenging YouTube\u2019s dominance.

Officer Gaetano Acerra was the man who paid the boy a visit at his home. In a one-on-one meeting with Cameron, the officer learned the distraught child wanted to run away from home. He said his mother was yelling at him for playing his older brother\u2019s video games. But Officer Acerra soon learned the issue was much deeper than that. Cameron led the officer inside his house, and then into his bedroom. His room was completely empty. His clothes were thrown in a trash bag. He didn\u2019t even have a bed. The officer learned Cameron\u2019s mother fell on hard times after having to make an unexpected move from Texas to South Carolina to care for a sick relative. That\u2019s when Officer Acerra did the unthinkable. Touched beyond belief, he totally went beyond the call of duty.

But at the end of Fashion Month, I don't have enough energy for DIY beauty treatments. So I decided to give up my lunch break to get a 30-minute rose power peel I've heard other beauty editors chatting about. Skincare creator and aesthetician Cecilia Wong employs a combination of Bulgarian and French rose oils, lemon and papaya extracts, LED light therapy and oxygen for a facial treatment that reduces hyperpigmentation (my biggest skincare woe), soothes sun damage and plumps up the skin. She assured me that I'd get off the table with a camera-ready complexion, and that's all she really had to say for me to lie down. Wong started the process by cleansing and then smoothing on a rose petal yogurt peel packed with antioxidants and vitamins A, C, D and E. The scent was heavenly, yet not heady as if I was stuck in a field of flowers. Next, she did a jade roller massage using her Reviving Black Currant Serum. Blended with black currant, blueberry and carrot seed oils, as well as argan oil, she explained that the black currant is actually one of the most potent sources of vitamin C. \"It has 5 times more vitamin C", "You\u2019ve Been Doing High-Fives Wrong All This While.

Also, they just ran a story about a man who swallowed a 64GB microSD card and then pooped it into a strainer so he could maybe recover the drone footage he shot on it.

Video of the incident filmed from a helicopter overhead appeared to some to show a 40-year-old unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher with his hands over his head being shot and killed by white police officer Betty Shelby, seemingly confirming the narrative that police routinely use excessive force and deadly violence against black men who pose no threat to them. But according to Tulsa World, evidence was discovered in Crutcher\u2019s vehicle that, while unknown to the officers on the scene at the time, could nevertheless explain some of the man\u2019s behavior that led to the officer feeling compelled to fire her weapon. Inside the vehicle beside which Crutcher was shot and killed was discovered a vial of PCP, a highly dangerous drug that can often create a psychopathic and violent state of mind in its users. In fact, there were numerous anecdotal accounts of individuals on PCP who become nearly impervious to pain, including gunshots, continuing to attack police officers and innocent bystanders alike even as they are being shot repeatedly in locations that would instantly drop an ordinary non-drug using suspect. Another matter that could very well help explain Crutcher\u2019s attitude and actions during the incident was that he had", "Ocean thrill.

The designation for \"unhealthiest president,\" however, is easier to bestow: President William Henry Harrison died after only a month in office in 1841. There are no reports of a chronic condition at the time of his election in 1940; Harrison rather fell ill shortly after taking office. He had won the presidential race with his running mate John Tyler, becoming America's first Whig president-elect. On the morning of March 4, Harrison took his Oath of Office at the Capitol Building's East Portico. It was a cold, windy day, with a noon temperature estimated at 48 degrees Fahrenheit . Harrison was woefully underdressed for the cold, opting to not wear a coat or any reasonable outerwear. He proceeded to give the longest Inaugural address in U.S. history. In addition to speaking for two hours in the cold , Harrison attended three different Inauguration balls. The exposure to the weather and frivolity proved too much for the new President and he caught a cold that persisted, soon developing into pneumonia. Harrison spent the bulk of his 31 days as Commander in Chief battling the malady, before he died in Washington D.C. on April 4.

This is a very sad night for the country. You can\u2019t polish this turd.

Depending on how you're feeling and the look you're going for, a swipe of mascara, your go-to fragrance, or a veil of dry shampoo can have some seriously transformative qualities, particularly when it comes to your confidence levels. As a matter of fact, when polled by Dove, 73% of women admitted that when shopping for a new beauty product, they seek out something that would make them feel their best, aesthetics aside. Weirdly enough, the product that made them feel the most confident wasn't a super-bold red lipstick or a thick sweep of liquid liner\u2014it was deodorant. In fact, the 1,574 women surveyed revealed that they found deodorant to be 13 times more important than lipstick, 10 times more important than eyeliner, 6 times more important than mascara, and 4 times more important than foundation. More than half admitted that, on the days they forgot to apply deodorant, they felt self-conscious and made it a point to distance themselves from others.

If you're Jewish, you probably know that means \"Happy New Year\" in Hebrew, and tomorrow marks the official celebration of Rosh Hashanah. While new years' presents aren't customary in the Jewish tradition, American Apparel has kindly offered a holiday surprise: the debut of a new Hasidic model. A post on American Apparel's Tumblr last week -- inserted between softcore porn photos of the brand's signature bodacious babes posing in high-cut swimsuits and sheer tops -- invites us to meet Yoel Weisshaus, who is apparently an American Apparel devotee.

Yoel is talented and drafts his own pleadings because he cannot afford an attorney, his case is still ongoing.

Absolutely, and if you do, you can develop a dangerous condition called hyponatremia, or water intoxication. Under normal conditions, the body beautifully maintains its fluid balance. Lose fluids through sweating, for instance, and your body responds with the feeling of thirst. You drink. If you swallow more liquid than needed just then, your body typically responds by excreting the excess through urination. But should you consume so much fluid that your body can\u2019t easily rid itself of the surplus, you dilute sodium levels in your blood. Osmosis then draws water from the blood into body cells to equalize sodium levels, and those cells swell. At that point, you have hyponatremia. If the cellular bloating occurs in the brain, it can be fatal. Until about 20 years ago, hyponatremia was extremely uncommon among healthy people. But then several marathon runners died from hyponatremia. In general, they had been middle- or back-of-the-pack, slower runners. They did not sweat much. But they drank plenty of water, trying to ensure that they would be well hydrated. Today, most knowledgeable coaches and exercise experts warn athletes not to overdrink. \"You should drink only when you need to, when you are actually thirsty,\" said Dr. James Winger,", "Mom Punishes Son And Forces Him To Mow The Lawn, But Never Anticipated THIS Would Ever Happen.

If you've ever eaten a pineapple, you'll have experienced that weird, scratchy, rough feeling on your tongue after you've munched through a few chunks. So why does that happen? It turns out that pineapple contains bromelain, a mixture of enzymes that digest proteins. Despite bromelain being an approved anti-inflammatory treatment and having other health benefits, when it comes into contact with the sensitive skin in and around one's mouth, it's actually breaking down proteins, causing the tissue to become sore and inflamed. So your favorite fruit is essentially eating your mouth. Yes, we're being dramatic. But you get the point.", "New on @Medium: What it's like when your children never grow up.

The company has deployed new imagery from NASA's Landsat 8 observation satellite in Google Maps and Google Earth, Program Manager Chris Herwig wrote in a blog post Monday.

The difference is actually substantial. Google offered two satellite images of New York City to showcase the change.

The 20-year-old, who is the daughter of the NBA star and ex-wife Juanita Vanoy, then took to her Instagram that same day to address the gay rumors: Some blogs, like Global Grind, took this to mean that Jordan was coming out. However, she has not classified her sexuality at all, whether gay, straight or bisexual. Jordan, a junior at Syracuse majoring in Sports Management, wrote on Instagram that she doesn't mind the attention she is getting these days, but she would like for everyone following her to keep things positive. \"I don't consider myself a celebrity or anything like that,\" she previously wrote in an Instagram post about people's newfound interest. \"I'm a human being.

Yet when it comes to how people view their banks, some institutions seem to have worse relationships with their patrons than others, according to a new analysis of customer complaints posted at the federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. The biggest offender, based on the number of complaints per billion in deposits, is a regional bank that isn\u2019t a household name outside of the Midwest: TCF Bank.

Wait times range from 3 minutes to 10 minutes and the queues are longer than the ones in brick and mortar stores. This just shows how popular Overwatch is and it is looking poised to break a few records. There might be several reasons why Blizzard might be doing this. For one, its servers might be genuinely getting clobbered at the moment due to too many people trying to purchase the game at once, but there\u2019s also the possibility that this is just a safety measure to safeguard itself against possible DDOS attacks which might severely hinder its ability to meet demands.

One of the most common, preferred ways psychologists use to measure personality is what's called the \"Big Five\": extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience. Want to skip to the quiz? Here's the link. People fit into a spectrum on these five dimensions. Everyone is more or less extroverted or more or less open to experience. (For a more thorough breakdown of what the big five personality dimensions mean, you can check out this page by the director of the Personality and Social Dynamics Lab at the University of Oregon.) There are complex elements of personality that fit within these categories. Captured within \"conscientiousness,\" for example, are traits like \"dutifulness,\" a person's sense of obligation, and characteristics like \"self-discipline,\" referring to willpower or the ability to persist on a task. While these are related and both fall under the umbrella of conscientiousness, a person might have a very strong sense of obligation but a less developed sense of self-discipline. The most thorough personality tests make distinctions between these characteristics. There are multiple versions of these tests, but one thorough and well-regarded one is called the International Personality Item Pool.", "The sad reason why women fake orgasms. Researchers Emily Thomas, Monika Stelzl, and Michelle Lafrance gathered 15 women (whose ages ranged from 19 to 28 years old) together to talk about faking orgasms. These volunteers each had been sexually active for at least one year at the time they were interviewed. During these interviews, the women were asked to talk about consensual sex \u2013 yet all 15 women ended up mentioning unenjoyable sexual experiences. \"While some women spoke about faking orgasm in positive ways, for instance, as a pleasurable experience that heightened their own arousal, many talked about feigning pleasure in the context of unwanted and unpleasurable sexual experiences,\" Thomas revealed. \"Within these accounts, we were struck by the degree to which women were connecting the practice of faking orgasm to accounts of unwanted sex.\" In other words: Some women are faking their orgasms so their partner will orgasm faster and so sex will be over sooner. To further analyze this unfortunate trend, researchers observed how these women discuss such sexual experiences when it comes to faking their orgasms. What the study\u2019s authors found was that \u2013 though these incidents could be seen as rape or coercion \u2013 these women never referred to them as such.

Dozens of presidential portraits hang in the bright halogen wattage of the National Portrait Gallery; 42 grace the White House. Gilbert Stuart set the template when he painted Washington in the rancorous waning years of his presidency. A bust-length version appeared on the $1 bill in 1869 and remains there today, making it the most-reproduced image in history. A full-length version hangs prominently in the East Room of the White House, and every president since John Adams has had to measure himself against the great man\u2019s penetrating gaze. Other presidential portraits followed the precedent of Stuart\u2019s Washington, standing by a desk strewn with books and papers. In the White House, those of Presidents James Polk, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Rutherford Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush are variants of the Washington original. A different presidential image, also pioneered by Stuart, had Thomas Jefferson seated at a desk. Knowing that the projection of personality was at the heart of politics, Jefferson wanted to embody \"chaste republican character\" by being portrayed as a man of the people doing his ordinary daily work. That \"Jeffersonian\" style was adopted in White House portraits of Presidents John Quincy Adams, John Tyler, Grover", "Male Escort Reveals What Women Really Want In The Bedroom.

But something else was going on. For more than 15 years, Savage's doctors doled out the same advice: You need to stop gaining weight. When Savage replied that she had tried watching her diet and exercising, only to pack on more pounds, it was clear they simply didn't believe her. Her family was equally skeptical. \"I would eat like my sister, and I would gain weight but she wouldn't,\" recalled Savage, a civil engineer who lives in Montgomery County and turns 31 next month.

Last year, after Savage had trouble getting pregnant, an inability she suspected was linked to her irregular periods, she consulted a new obstetrician/gynecologist. The doctor suggested that Savage's constellation of problems might have a single cause. But it took a second OB/GYN to conduct the proper tests, which led to a definitive diagnosis of a common -- and consequential -- disorder. \"It's frustrating to me that so many doctors\" didn't think of this, she said. \"If I'd known, I would have made changes years", "Hiker Spotted Footprints Of The Yeti In Remote Area Of The Himalayas.

Furthermore the Yeti put one foot directly in front of the other and these tracks are similar to the tracks of the Yeti I have seen, the Yak herder said to Mr. Berry. Another interesting detail, the area of the supposed footprints of the Yeti is located in the same region of the Himalayas (see above image) where Google Earth has blacked out a large part of a mountain peak and where locals witnesses strange apparitions and suspicious objects.", "Their parents #disappeared at the railway station.\n#ThisIsIT.

A report from Fortune says a California woman by the name of Leah Caldwell is actually suing Chipotle, the national chain serving people with the finest in Mexican grill, for $2.2 billion. Yes, that's a \"b.\" That's reportedly what the company would make in profit over a nine-year period. Why? Because they used a photograph of her without her consent. The lawsuit states that a photographer took Caldwell's picture in 2006 at a Chipotle restaurant in Denver, and she refused to sign a release form. It looks like she figured that was enough to keep her photo out of whatever Chipotle ads are out there, but she was surprised to find out in 2014 that her picture was not only on display in an Orlando Chipotle, but in additional Chipotles across California. What's worse? Her likeness was altered, which apparently shed \"false light upon her character associated with consuming alcoholic beverages.\" The image was said to have had bottles added to it, and also remixed her hairstyle. Now, that's not right. If someone takes your photo for a company and you're like, \"Nah, I'm good on not having my likeness be a part of your corporation,\" that should be enough.

The legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \"Harry Potter\" or Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa. HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him. What are you up to today? Rickman: I'm in New York.

At the time, Kotb was working as a Dateline NBC correspondent and hosting a weekly TV series called \"Your Total Health.\" With a new lease on life, Kotb decided to do something she'd never had the guts to do before. \"I'm going to go ask for that job,\" she says. \"I always waited in the front row, like, 'They'll notice me, I'm a hard worker.'\" \"That\" job was to cohost the new fourth hour of the \"Today\" show. \"And I remember walking into [previous CEO of NBC Universal] Jeff Zucker's office and I remember saying to him, 'You can't scare me, I want this job!'\" Kotb says her fear of asking for a promotion was small and petty compared to cancer. \"I had this moment where I felt so strong and empowered,\" she says. She also gives some insight into how she sustains her seemingly limitless positive attitude. \"Don't let anyone steal your joy,\" Kotb advises.

It's no secret that tortoises are among the most resilient animals on Earth, perfectly adapted for life in natural environments that others would find inhospitable. But for one particularly tenacious pet tortoise, that hardy sense of survival allowed it to endure for decades in the most unnatural of places. Back in 1982, the Almeida Family was saddened to learn that their beloved pet, Manuela, a young red-footed tortoise, had gone missing. Their house was under renovation at the time, so the family just assumed that the slow-moving animal had slipped out through a gate left open by the construction crew -- disappearing into the forest near their home in Realengo, Brazil. But they couldn't have been more wrong. The true fate of their lost pet remained a mystery for the next 30 years, that is, until recently. Earlier last month, after their father Leonel passed away, the Almeida children returned to help clean out his cluttered storage room upstairs. As it turns out, Leonel was somewhat of a hoarder, so the room was jam-packed with things that he had found on the street, like broken televisions and furniture. Deciding it was mostly junk, the family set about moving it to the", "You may be surprised by who's filming amateur porn. Amateur porn website Homegrown Video (NSFW link) cataloged all video submissions they received over a six-month period. They found that almost one-third of homemade sex tapes submitted between July and December 2013 were created not in sexually liberal coastal cities, as one might imagine, but in the Bible Belt. Furthermore, 56.9 percent of videos were submitted by women. (A representative for the site told The Huffington Post that Homegrown Video takes steps to ensure that all videos featured on the site are done so with the express permission of all parties featured. Couples are required to include a short clip acknowledging they are making a video of their own free will, are not intoxicated, and have read the site's terms and conditions when signing the release. Given the impact of revenge porn, we're glad these steps are being taken.) The states with the highest number of submissions were California (20.6 percent) and Pennsylvania (11.8 percent), but 10.8 percent of submissions came from Florida and 6.9 percent from Texas. Other Bible Belt states contributing submissions included North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky. These results are consistent with a recent PornHub study, which found that the religiosity of an area had little impact", "Why this tech company is giving 100 people free money. \"I think we are moving towards a world with less job security,\" says Matthew Krisiloff, who is managing Y Combinator\u2019s UBI study. \"There\u2019s political consensus around it, and there\u2019s relative simplicity in the sense that it\u2019s just direct cash and you can spend it however you want.\" Here\u2019s what you should know about UBI: What is Universal Basic Income? In its most pure form, a government would send all citizens a certain annual income to everyone, regardless of their salary, age or employment status, typically in installments throughout the year. In reality, it gets a little more complicated. Sending money to every single citizen is expensive, so most UBI proposals involve some limits on who is eligible for the money \u2014 minors and the already-wealthy, for instance, might get smaller checks. Limits aside, the general point remains the same: (Almost) everyone gets a check from the government to spend without restrictions. Why is it popular? The basic concept has intellectual roots dating back to at least the 18th century . Some on the political left have supported UBI a tool to redistribute wealth to the poor and provide a means to improve people\u2019s quality of life, while some on the right", "Johnny Manziel had this response to his Browns jerseys selling for $1.99. On Friday, this photograph of Johnny Manziel jerseys marked all the way down to $1.99 made its way around the internet: A short time later, Manziel reposted the photo to Instagram, added a black and white filter, and wrote, \"LOL.\" Manziel, the Browns' 2014 first-round pick, may have taken his last NFL snap after a forgettable two seasons in Cleveland and an offseason of non-stop partying. But early in 2015, he appeared to be on the right path.

Last May, then-teammate Karlos Dansby said that Manziel had \"grown up right before our eyes,\" adding, \"He made a decision to help him be a better man [by going to treatment]. And that's all at the end of the day that's all we want, we want him to be the best person he can possibly be, because him being the best he can possibly be is going to be the best player that the Browns can possibly have on the field.\" It didn't work out that way, of course.

In a column in the Wall Street Journal, John Greathouse of Rincon Venture Partners outlined his belief that women will get more opportunities in tech if they \"create an online presence that obscures their gender.\" Bizarrely equating hiring practices in tech to blind orchestra auditions, Greathouse suggested that women do things like only use their first initial and eliminate photos on both Twitter and LinkedIn. Rather than call on tech companies to overcome the unconscious bias that can too easily be baked into hiring practices, Greathouse thinks women should solve the problem themselves by hiding who they really are. \"[The column] made me really mad.\" said Angela Dalton , a managing director at Guggenheim. \"It\u2019s wrong on so many levels.

It seems Blizzard isn\u2019t one to go back on its words. Last month it promised that it\u2019ll ban any cheaters or hackers in Overwatch, and there will be no second chances provided. Fast forward to now, only a few days after the game\u2019s official launch, and it\u2019s already coming good on its promise by banning thousands of Overwatch players. Anyone using Overwatch cheat programs are being banned by Blizzard, and the company unleashed a massive ban wave yesterday that forced the program\u2019s creators to actually shut down the servers until they figure out how to bypass Blizzard\u2019s security. That\u2019s not all, however. A PC Gamer report mentions that Blizzard is banning cheaters not only once, but several times. This means if you\u2019ve cheated, buying a new copy might not be enough. Several users are reporting that Blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy. A few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game. Blizzard\u2019s even taken a more brutal stance in China. The company, along with its partner NetEase, has ensured it bans anyone stupid enough to try cheating in the game.

A lot of inner city schools in America,\" Dimon told CNNMoney in an exclusive interview in Detroit. \"Americans should understand that 50%, or something like, of the kids in inner-city schools, often poor and often minority, don't graduate. And the ones that do, don't necessarily have the skills to get a job. That is the biggest disgrace in this country,\" Dimon lamented. \"We should be ringing an alarm bell on every hilltop and every mountain top and saying this shouldn't be allowed.\" In a separate event for a group of entrepreneurs in Detroit, Dimon pointed out that there were more than 5 million open jobs in the U.S. right now, near a record high. With some 8 million unemployed Americans, the problem is a skills gap. Dimon argues the failure to educate America's youth with the skills needed to get these jobs is the ultimate societal failure. As CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Dimon spent the day in Detroit recently to meet with entrepreneurs and small-business owners and see the impact of a $100 million commitment his bank has made to the revival of the city.

The valuation was more conservative than the $15 billion some analysts had expected for the social media phenomenon, potentially attracting investors who might consider the money-losing company's listing price a better deal, with room to rise. Twitter had signaled for weeks it would price its IPO modestly to avoid the sort of stock plummet that spoiled Facebook's coming-out party. It said on Thursday it intends to sell 70 million shares between $17 and $20 apiece, raking in up to $1.4 billion for the company. If underwriters choose to sell an additional allotment of 10.5 million shares, the offer could raise as much as $1.6 billion. Twitter's offering will be the most high-profile Internet IPO since Facebook's May 2012 debut, when the social network giant's shares fell below their offering price and did not recover until a year later. Still, the modest pricing doesn't obscure questions about Twitter's profitability. \"The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop,\" said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Weath Management. \"But in the end, even for $11 billion, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number?

Of the 2,081 UK adults surveyed by Mobile Phone Checker, 62 percent of men admitted to snooping through a partner's phone, compared to only 34 percent of women who said the same. (Note that Mobile Phone Checker only surveyed people who are currently in relationships). Eighty-nine percent of the people who admitted to cell phone snooping said that their motivation was to make sure that their partner was not cheating or talking to anyone else in a romantic or sexual way. And sure enough, 48 percent of people said that their snooping did turn up evidence of infidelity. And while men were more likely to look through a partner's phone, women are more likely to actually confront a significant other about what they found. Fifty-nine percent of women said they would talk to their partner about their findings, while only 37 percent of men said the same. If the tables were turned on the survey's respondents and they discovered that their significant other was snooping, 31 percent of people said they would consider ending the relationship.

Body image issues aren\u2019t typically associated with men, though they are fairly widespread. According to a recent study published in Psychology of Men & Masculinity, as many as 20% to 40% of American men are struggling with body image problems in some shape or form. It shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise then, that a newer study has revealed such body image issues are spurring millions of men to hit the gym \u2014 even though many would probably never admit it. Specifically, it\u2019s \"men\u2019s hidden fears about body fat\" that are driving gym attendance, according to a team of researchers from the University of Lincoln (U.K.) and Australia\u2019s Curtin University. The study says these men are motivated by \"feelings of guilt and shame rather than a desire to build muscle,\" which may come as a surprise to many \u2014 even men who may not be willing to admit it to themselves.", "This seagull fell into a vat of chicken tikka masala. I think I can explain why. Perhaps you've seen photos of the bird, colored orange from his dip. (Turmeric, a key ingredient in curry, contains a potent orange pigment.) It looks like he\u2019s trying to cosplay as an Angry Bird. But why? Seagulls are what biologists called kleptoparasites , animals that rob the food of other species. And the birds can be damn cunning about it. According to Seabirds: Feeding Ecology and Role in Marine Ecosystems, kleptoparasitism is a survival strategy that minimizes the energy expenditure needed to obtain food. Basically, the gulls have realized, why search for your own food when there's some perfectly good food in another animal's possession? They need to be clever to do so. Birds that are kleptoparasites tend to have bigger brains than birds that live the straight and narrow. For it to be considered kleptoparasitism, the biologist Erika Iyengar explains , the parasite has to steal food from the host, and the host has to suffer as consequence. (The people who were not able to eat that delicious spiced chicken because, gross, a bird was in it, definitely suffered.) And it's not just human food. Gulls and some other birds will steal food right from the clutches of other birds,", "How Do 'Star Trek' Stardates Work? The Original Series In the original Trek TV series, stardates were, in a word, bogus. In the series bible, the Star Trek Guide, writers were basically told to wing it. Here's a snippet (emphasis added): Pick any combination of four numbers plus a percentage point [ed. note: tenths digit], use it as your story's stardate. For example, 1313.5 is twelve o'clock noon of one day and 1314.5 would be noon of the next day. Each percentage point is roughly equivalent to one-tenth of one day. The progression of stardates in your script should remain constant but don't worry about whether or not there is a progression from other scripts. Stardates are a mathematical formula which varies depending on location in the galaxy, velocity of travel, and other factors, can vary widely from episode to episode. This obviously wasn't thought through very well, as it boils down to \"Pick a number and stay near it.\" Show creator Gene Roddenberry later said: When we began making episodes, we would use a stardate such as 2317 one week, and then a week later when we made the next episode we would move the star date up to 2942, and so on.

Appearing on Shawshank Redemption was a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page. The original title [of Stephen King's short story] was ... 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.' Now, don\u2019t choose 'Shawshank Redemption' when you\u2019ve got Rita Hayworth!

But they chose not to, and so it took a while to catch on. While the original title of Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption doesn\u2019t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. Today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter than Rita", "This is why Niantic has blocked third-party Pok\u00e9mon Go trackers.

Hillary Clinton tweeted that the 5,000% spike was \"outrageous\" and amounted to \"price gouging.\" Nothing about the drug itself had changed except this: a new company -- Turing Pharmaceuticals -- had bought the rights to distribute it. The Daily Beast dubbed Turing's CEO \"the most hated man in America.\" A year later, one pill of Daraprim costs $375 for many patients. Turing hails this as a 50% reduction in price, but doctors are livid. The drug still costs 2,500% more than before the hike. \"It remains criminal,\" say Dr. Wendy Armstrong, a medical professor at Emory University and head of the Infectious Diseases Program at Grady Health System in Atlanta, Ga. \"It's still an immense financial burden for a drug that should be $1 a pill.\" Turing says it has put in place programs to \"ensure access to Daraprim for every single patient who needs the drug, regardless of ability to pay.\" Controversial CEO Martin Shkreli also left the company late last year.

A new study published this week in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that approximately one-third of patients with what researchers referred to as \"treatment-resistant depression\" experienced a significant mood improvement after being treated with up to six intravenous ketamine infusions over the course of several weeks. \"Three days after the last infusion, the depression scores had halved in 29 percent of the patients,\" said a news release on the study, which was conducted by United Kingdom researchers at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Oxford. \"In those that responded to the treatment, the duration of benefit varied widely, lasting between 25 days and 8 months\" Lead researcher Dr. Rupert McShane said some of the patients involved in the study had lived with depression for 20 years. \"It really is dramatic for some people,\" he told the BBC of the improvements seen in some of the study's subjects. \"It's the sort of thing really that makes it worth doing psychiatry, it's a really wonderful thing to see.\" McShane's study had a small sample of just 28 patients, but his isn't the first to link ketamine -- a Schedule III drug known on the street as \"Special K\" or simply", "It Doesn't Matter How Much You Exercise If You Also Do This. But simply moving more isn't enough, according to a new report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine . The benefits of exercise can be blunted if you also spend most of the rest of your day sitting. Dr. David Alter, a heart expert from the University of Toronto and senior scientist at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, and his colleagues found that sitting too much\u2014even among people who exercise regularly\u2014led to higher rates of hospitalization, heart disease and cancer, as well as early death. The researchers looked at 47 studies that asked people how much time they spent sitting and exercising, as well as rates of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and death from any cause. The more hours people in the studies spent sedentary\u2014like watching TV or reclining on a couch\u2014the higher their risk of all of these negative outcomes. Heavy sitters showed a 90% higher risk of developing diabetes than those who sat less, an 18% higher chance of dying of heart disease or cancer, and 24% greater odds of dying from any cause. These rates were the average among people who both exercised regularly and those who did not. \"What struck me, and I was quite surprised by this,", "Should this military grade flashlight be banned?

And among Democrats, Clinton, with 47.2% is just five points ahead of Bernie Sanders. There is, of course, a difference between polls and casino odds. One actively and methodically solicits the opinions of registered voters. The other is determined purely by gambler gut instinct. So, while you may want to take the casino odds with a grain of salt, it's worth noting that betfair isn't the only online gambling site that's predicting a strong Trump showing in the primary -- with Clinton winning a narrow victory. PaddyPower.com currently gives Trump 5/2 odds for winning the presidency. Clinton is", "His Babysitter Was A Monster And Mom Had No Idea. Then the Dog Started Acting Strangely... When Hope and Benjamin Jordan moved to Charleston, South Carolina, for work, they knew they couldn\u2019t care for their toddler Finn without some outside help. As a result, then, they went in search of a trustworthy babysitter. Certainly, it\u2019s never easy for parents to leave their children in the care of a stranger. However, for the Jordans, who had arrived in a new area with an infant in tow, finding the right person to look after their son was paramount. So the couple were relieved to find 22-year-old Alexis Khan, whom they liked immediately. After Khan passed all the necessary background checks without any problems, then, she was hired to look after seven-month-old Finn. \"We felt like Alexis was a good fit at the time,\" husband Benjamin recalled to Charleston-based news station WCSC-TV. Indeed, in addition to passing all checks into her history, Khan had had babysitting jobs before. Five months into the arrangement, however, and things had started to change. As well as caring for baby Finn, Khan had the added company of the Jordans\u2019 dog, Killian. And Killian wasn\u2019t as happy as Hope and Benjamin were with the situation. Killian, a German shepherd/black Labrador cross, was normally a calm", "NYC subway worker helps rescue stroller that rolled onto tracks. On Monday morning a stroller with a toddler inside accidentally rolled onto the train tracks at the Jamaica Center-Parsons Boulevard and Archer Avenue stop in Queens, New York, CBS New York reported. The child's mother had turned away for a moment when the stroller rolled forward. The 39-year-old mother jumped onto the tracks after her toddler and sprained her ankle in the process, according to ABC 7. Fortunately, a subway cleaner and some bystanders came to the rescue, and helped to get mother and child back onto the platform before the next train came. Diane, the subway cleaner who rushed to help, said the mother had forgotten to put the brakes on the stroller when she turned to throw away some garbage, CBS New York reported. \"I\u2019m a mother,\" Diane told the outlet. \"So I know how she must have felt.\" Workers on the other end of the platform signaled for the next train to stop, but by then the woman and the child, and their rescuers, were safely off the tracks, according to the New York Post. \"The passengers who helped were heroes,\" an MTA worker told the outlet. \"They actually stayed to make sure the baby was all right.", "Look who caught the bouquet at the Grammys mass wedding. At the end of the performance, it was none other than Katy Perry who caught one of the bouquets during the bouquet toss. The pop star uploaded a photo of her posing with the flowers to Instagram, writing, \"Congrats to all the #samelove couples tonight. You had me in tears of joy for y'all! Also... Look who caught the bouquet!!!\" As wedding tradition has it, the person who catches the bouquet is the next to get married. The bouquet catch comes amid speculation that Perry is set to tie the knot with boyfriend John Mayer, who she has dated on-and-off since the summer of 2012. In November 2013, the pop star wore a diamond ring on her left ring finger, sparking rumors that the two were engaged. Sunday's mass wedding was officiated by Queen Latifah and included both gay and straight couples. The performance also featured the song's vocalist Mary Lambert and an appearance by Madonna.

That's what the experts say, at least, as they look back at the top trends and sellers from 2013. According to statistics from The NPD Group Inc., more women than ever bought lip products in 2013, resulting in double-digit sales gains for the segment. In fact, lip sales were on par with sales for nail products, reports Women's Wear Daily -- and the beauty industry focused a great deal of their attention on nail polish this year. In 2012, nail polish sales hit $768 million, up 32 percent from the year before. That made nails the fastest-growing segment within the beauty biz, prompting brands to turn their focus to customers' hands in 2013. But in 2013, WWD notes, lipstick actually turned out to be the big winner. \"Lip really is the new nail,\" Laura Weinstein, vice president marketing of Sally Hansen and NYC New York Color, told WWD. That means in 2014, you can expect your favorite makeup companies to be rolling out even more lip products, from lipsticks and stains to products we probably haven't even thought of yet (and probably don't need... and will buy anyway).

This was their sad effort. The most offensively yellow thing since Big Bird got mustard all over his dick. The deafeningly loud music is back, as are the random voice clips -- only now the clips freeze the game every time they play (which is constantly). So while our times on this game are quite a bit longer than on the other LCD games, it's mostly because there was a two-second voice clip playing every, well, two seconds. \"How many sound clips do you want?\" \"Just fuck me up.\" Also, the enemies attack you from strange, non-Euclidean angles where it's not clear how to hit them back, as if the game was designed by H.P.

Beijing has been dumping U.S. government debt to prop up its currency. China uses the dollars it gets from selling U.S. Treasuries to buy the yuan, which has sunk to an 8-year low as the world's second largest economy slows. China's huge holdings of U.S. debt fell to $1.12 trillion at the end of October, their lowest level in more than six years, according to U.S. Treasury Department data. Japan held $1.13 trillion. Both countries offloaded Treasuries during the month, but China dumped far more: its holdings dropped by $41.3 billion, while Japan's fell by just $4.5 billion. China's willingness to lend vast sums to the U.S. government has drawn a lot of attention in recent years. Since September 2008, the Treasury Department has ranked it as the biggest foreign creditor to the U.S., with the exception of one month in early 2015 and again with its latest update. The situation has raised concerns about Beijing's leverage over the United States. President-elect Donald Trump has claimed the opposite, suggesting it gives the United States \"a lot of power\" over China. Experts say the reality is more complicated, arguing that the debt relationship binds the world's two largest economies closely together. Trump", "What is the easiest way to quit smoking? Mar 04, 2017 What does Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, and Ellen DeGeneras all have in common? They quit smoking using hypnotherapy. Celebrities have discovered the effective results of hypnotherapy and have used it to conquer their own smoking habits. Researchers at the University of Iowa combined more than 600 studies of smoking cessation programs involving 72,000 people from North America and Europe1. Hypnosis was found to be over 3 times more effective than nicotine replacement therapy and 15 times more effective than quitting cold turkey. A comparison study of smoking cessation treatments was conducted by North Shore Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital2. 26 weeks after discharge, 50% of patients who received hypnotherapy exclusively were non-smokers compared to the 25% of patients who didn't and only 16% of patients who used nicotine replacement therapy alone. Types of Addiction Smoking addiction is a combination of two types of addiction. There's the physical addiction, then there is the mental, or psychological addiction. Although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addictions, even more addictive than cocaine, the good news is that the physical side of things doesn't last very long.

Desmond: ...Because of my success with Bon Jovi, John Kalodner -- the famous John Kalodner, legendary A&R man -- asked me if I would go up to Boston and meet Aerosmith. They had never written with an outside writer, and they were not happy to see me. They were going along with it to please John Kalodner, but they were not that happy about it. Steven (Tyler) was much more friendly, as he is, and was very generous, really, and showed me a song that they had started called \"Cruisin' for the Ladies.\" I listened to that lyric, and I said, \"You know what, that's a very boring title.\" And they looked at me like, \"How dare you?\" And then Steven volunteered, sheepishly, and said that when he first wrote the melody he was singing \"Dude Looks like a Lady.\" It was kind of a tongue twister that sounded more like scatting. He got the idea because they had gone to a bar and had seen a girl at the end of the bar with ginormous blonde rock hair, and the girl turned around and it ended up being Vince Neil from Motley Crue.

We messed it up a little bit. I hope people call it a romantic comedy, and I'm proud to have it called that.\" Robespierre \"messed it up a little bit\" by focusing her love story on a stand-up comic named Donna (Jenny Slate) who has a one-night stand, gets pregnant and decides to have an abortion. According to Robespierre, \"Obvious Child\" -- which was first a 2009 short film that also starred Slate -- was created as an answer to films such as \"Knocked Up\" and \"Juno,\" where unexpected pregnancies led to new families. \"They just didn\u2019t feel true,\" Robespierre told the New York Times in a recent interview. \"I'm so neurotic that I'm sure there's backlash out there,\" the director said about her film, which debuted at this year's Sundance Film Festival to near-universal praise. \"Not just from the right, but from people who think scatological jokes", "Family values. \"Praise be to Allah that he became a martyr.

Coming a close second is Sweden, followed by Singapore, which overtook South Korea as the most powerful in Asia this year. The UK narrowly made it into the top 10, beating the USA by just three countries. The latest ranking, released by Passportindex.org, takes into account the number of visa-free regions and countries that a passport has access to. It includes destinations that are completely visa-free and the ones that require visa on arrival. Germany's passport, which allows its holders to travel to 158 countries around the world without having to get a visa before departure, is top of the list. The country held the same position last year but it now offers one less destination compared to 2016. The Swedish and Singaporean passports both allow its holders to visit 157 destinations. However, Sweden ranks higher on the list because 123 of these destinations are completely visa-free (rather than visa on arrival) while for Singapore, it's 122. The rest of the top 10 is made up of European countries including Denmark, Finland, France, Spain, Switzerland, Norway and the UK.

Recently released data from the 2012 U.S. Census revealed which cities have the highest concentration of same-sex couple households (among cities with a population of 65,000 or above). The surprising frontrunner? Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where same-sex couples make up a whopping 2.8 percent of total households. The Florida beach town has long been a destination for the vacationing LGBT community and is home to 19 gay resorts. The real jaw-dropper, however, comes with a switch-up between two much larger cities. With 2.5 percent same-sex households, San Francisco came in a close third (third!) to Seattle, where gay households are suddenly booming. The city leaped from an estimated 1.7 percent of households in 2011 to 2.6 percent, according to recent data, nudging San Francisco from its cherished gay pedestal. Seattle has long been hailed as a gay-friendly city, but its recent hold on same-sex households may be attributed to its overall family-friendliness. \"Most same-sex couples, in choosing a place to live, want what other families want \u2014 affordable housing, more space, good schools,\" the Seattle Times noted in 2011, when the city\u2019s surge in gay couples was first noted.

So what's causing these temperature extremes? The polar vortex is a mass of winds that form over the Arctic each winter, and tend to move in a circular motion around the region, according to NASA. This year, however, a few factors caused the vortex to dip south, like the jet stream moving further south than usual and a low-pressure system forming over Canada, according to the video. As this animation progresses from early December 2013 to early January 2014, you can watch the polar vortex -- represented by the purple colors -- bend southward over time.

Inequality goes back at least 30,000 years. Hunter-gatherers were more equal than subsequent societies. They had very little property, and property is a pre-requisite for long-term inequality. But even they had hierarchies. In the 19th and 20th Centuries, however, something changed. Equality became a dominant value in human culture, almost all over the world. Why? It was partly down to the rise of new ideologies such as humanism, liberalism and socialism. But it was also about technological and economic change - which was connected to those new ideologies, of course. Suddenly the elite needed large numbers of healthy, educated people to serve as soldiers in the army and as workers in the factories. Governments didn't educate and vaccinate to be nice. They needed the masses to be useful. But now that's changing again. The best armies today require a small number of highly professional soldiers using very high-tech kit. Factories, too, are increasingly automated. This is one reason why we might - in the not-too-distant future - see the creation of the most unequal societies that have ever existed in human history. And there are other reasons to fear such a future. With rapid improvements in biotechnology and bioengineering, we may", "NBC reporter's enormous blunder.

Todd replied that, \"more importantly,\" that incorrect information \"would be stuff that Republicans have successfully messaged against it.\" He continued, \"They don't repeat the other stuff because they haven't even heard the Democratic message.\" Then came the fateful words: \"What I always love is people say, 'Well, it's you folks' fault in the media.'

Nonetheless, like a lot of stuff floating around on the internet, the claim about these color codes is completely false. The color on the bottom of your toothpaste means absolutely nothing about the ingredients, and you shouldn\u2019t use it to help you decide on a toothpaste. What the toothpaste color codes supposedly mean A fake consumer tip about the color codes of toothpaste tubes has been circulating the internet for quite some time. According to the tip, you should be paying close attention to the bottom of your toothpaste tubes. There\u2019s a small colored square at the bottom and the color, be it black, blue, red, or green, allegedly", "HE BURNS COFFEE GROUNDS IN HIS BACKYARD. THE REASON? GENIUS! ~ urDoca.com. Mosquitos suck. Literally. They can turn the most relaxed of backyard barbecues into a frenzy of swatting and knee-slapping. And then there are allergies and serious viruses like Zika that can be transmitted by the annoying little buggers. But you know what sucks even more than mosquitos? Some of the commercial repellants that\u2019ll suck your wallet empty over the summer season, especially if you\u2019re the outdoorsy type. Commercial repellants also tend to havemore than a few harmful effects that arise from breathing them in. The solution? Believe it or not, coffee grounds! The Environmental Protection Agency says coffee grounds work as a very effective natural repellant that will keep many insects \u2013 including mosquitos, wasps and bees \u2013 away. Many insects have a very strong sense of smell, and coffee grounds, which are incredibly strong-smelling when they burn, drive them crazy. So how do you use them? Easy! Take your used or fresh coffee grounds, put them in a bowl and cover it with aluminum foil. Leave this bowl in a dark, cool place  and let the grounds dry completely. Then, place the grounds (either in a bowl or on a sheet of foil) on a flat area outdoors and", "Hong Kong Billionaire is offering $180,000,000 to do just ONE thing. Real estate tycoon Sze-tsung is desperate to see his daughter married off to a man. So desperate in fact that he has offered a whopping $180,000,000 to any man that can turn his beloved daughter straight. To make matters worse, this daughter Gigi is not even single. In fact she is happily married to long term partnered Sean Eav. A marriage which her father refuses to accept as \"real\". The South China Morning Post explained that Billionaire Cecil Chao Sze-tsung was interviewed by Malaysian newspaper Nanyang Siang Pau. In this interview Cecil Chao insisted that his daughter was in fact single and added that it was not too late to change her thinking. His daughter, Gigi Chao, responded to this by writing a poignant open letter (which is just over the page) to her father. It should be noted that Sze-tsung is known for his outlandish statements and has in the past claimed to have slept with 10,000 women.", "The world's highest paid musician is ... Don't be.

Add to that heavy \"merchandise sales at concerts as well as her Material Girl clothing line and Truth or Dare fragrance,\" and you've got a clear winner. Her runner-up, Lady Gaga, trails behind with a \"mere\" $80 million. The tour she cut short due to her injury, explains Forbes, still grossed $168 million.

The law makes California the first state to require websites to allow people younger than 18 to remove their own postings on that website, and to clearly inform minors how to do so. \"Kids and teens frequently self-reveal before they self-reflect,\" Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, told The Huffington Post. \"In today's digital age, mistakes can stay with and haunt kids for their entire life.

In a 2012 Kaplan survey of college admissions counselors, nearly a quarter said they checked out applicants' social networking. Of those counselors, 35 percent said what they found -- including included vulgarities, alcohol consumption and \"illegal activities\" -- negatively affected applicants' admissions chances. Major social media sites -- Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Vine -- already allow users of any age to delete their posts, including photos and comments. California's \"eraser button\" law will require this policy for all websites with users in the state. The new law also prohibits", "The Internet's most hated man is ready to take his company public. Then his wife finally asked if he was serious about the idea.

Since then he has succeeded in building up a large business and reputation. BusinessWeek once described him as \"possibly evil\" and Biderman's own company has (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) billed him as \"the most hated man on the Internet.\" In reality, Biderman, 43, is a mess of contradictions: He is a happily married man from a family of happily married couples running a website to help married people cheat because he believes some societal change is coming. He poses as a provocateur for AshleyMadison's marketing, but comes off in person as fairly down to earth and self-aware. He often leaves work around 5 p.m. to make it to dinner with his children and jokes that his infidelity service could turn into a family business. If all goes according to plan,", "How Is The \"Octomom\" Doing 7 Years After She Gave Birth? Such an incredible pregnancy and birth made headlines around the world. People were absolutely fascinated by the fact that one woman could carry so many children at once. The fact they were born healthy was an even bigger miracle. These octuplets actually broke a record when they all lived one week. No previous octuplets had all survived longer than one week. These babies were all born healthy and remained so in the weeks after they were born. Doctors were shocked that she had such a healthy group of children. The state of California, however, was not impressed. The octuplets were conceived via in vitro fertilization (IVF). The doctor who performed the IVF treatment, Michael Kamrava, implanted her with a dozen embryos at her request. The state of California revoked his medical license for this, charging him with \"gross negligence\" with \"repeated negligent acts, for an excessive number of embryo transfers.\" The birth immediately made Suleman a celebrity. Right after her children were born, she hired the Killeen Furtney Group to handle her public relations. This firm actually quit representing her when they began receiving death threats almost immediately. The outrage stemmed from the fact that Suleman had six children already.

Star Wars: Episode VIII won\u2019t be released for more than a year, but thanks to Mark Hamill, fans may have their first big hint about what\u2019s to come. The 64-year-old actor \u2014 who plays Luke Skywalker in the space fantasy saga \u2014 shared a video on Twitter Tuesday in which he shaved off his beard as part of a promotion for his upcoming show Pop Culture Quest. However, given that this facial hair was a part of his seasoned Jedi look in The Force Awakens, Hamill captioned the clip with a galaxy far, far away-themed clause. \"Haven\u2019t seen my chin since May \u201915, so #FarewellFacialFur & #ByeByeBeard,\" he wrote, adding, \"(at least til #EpisodeIX).\" Does this mean everyone can rest easy knowing that Luke survives the events of Episode VIII? Not necessarily. Luke is a powerful Jedi, so if he does die in the eighth movie, he could always appear in the ninth as a Force ghost \u2014 a plot device used with characters such as Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the past. Of course, this could also just be a Kit Harington-style misdirect by Hamill to keep fans off the scent of his true fate.", "Doomed city's elite dined on giraffe and sea urchin!? Remains of food scraps found in the drains of Pompeii, Italy, a Roman city wiped out by a volcano, revealed that the middle- and lower-class residents dined on cheap but healthy foods, while slightly wealthier citizens dined on delicacies. The new findings belie the common belief that the Roman elite dined on exotic delicacies while poor Romans starved on birdseed. \"The traditional vision of some mass of hapless lemmings \u2014 scrounging for whatever they can pinch from the side of a street, or huddled around a bowl of gruel \u2014 needs to be replaced by a higher fare and standard of living, at least for the urbanites in Pompeii,\" study co-author Steven Ellis, a classics professor at the University of Cincinnati, said in a statement. Pompeii was a bustling Roman city that was buried in ash after the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Ellis and his colleagues excavated about 20 shop fronts near one of the once-bustling gates of Pompeii known as the Portia Stabia. The latrines and cesspits behind the food sellers revealed charred food waste from the kitchens, as well as human waste, that dated as far back as the fourth century B.C., when Pompeii was", "You Won't Believe How Much the TSA Makes From Leftover Change.

The line, which Women's Wear Daily promises to \"evoke the Parisian fashion photographer's ambitious, provocative work,\" will be available permanently on October 15. Snapchat can indeed be ambitious and provocative, but we're not certain how well the photo-sharing app can convey enough information to convince us to buy cosmetics.

People have found many ways to make fun of Superman over the years, but certainly one of the questions raised most often about the character is the way in which he protects his secret identity. Unlike many superheroes who wear masks, the Man of Steel does nothing to cover his face when fighting crime, but hides under a simple pair of glasses as reporter Clark Kent. Readers have spent decades laughing about how impossible this seems, but it may surprise you to learn that a pair of spectacles actually do a rather good job of masking a person's looks. Researchers at the University of York recently conducted a study about the effect that glasses have when it comes to facial recognition, and while the thinking behind the experiment was driven by important world matters like border control security, they seemingly inadvertently showed that Researchers at the University of York recently conducted a study about the effect that glasses have when it comes to facial recognition, and while the thinking behind the experiment was driven by important world matters like border control security, they seemingly inadvertently showed that Clark Kent 's disguise is somewhat plausible.

But should we be worried? A group of researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health wanted to find out, so they took a bunch of trips on the Boston city subway and started swabbing. In their new study published in the American Society for Microbiology\u2019s journal mSystems , the scientists report on what they found when they sampled the seats, seat backs, walls, poles, ticketing machines and hanging straps on the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority. They were amazed at how much the city subway looks, microbially speaking, like a mosaic of humans. The most dominant bacteria on all of the surfaces were from people's skin and mouths. And the kinds of colonies that thrived in certain places, like hanging grips, depended on how that surface is used: the scientists found enriched colonies of breathing-borne bacteria on touchscreens and vaginal bacteria on fuzzy polyester seats. Happily, though, the scientists didn\u2019t find pathogenic organisms that typically cause sickness or antibiotic-resistant genes. \"I was surprised by the degree to which these environments really do look like people,\" says senior author Curtis Huttenhower, associate professor of computational biology and", "Here's the city with the worst allergies (it's not D.C.):. So if you are a resident of Louisville, Kentucky, congratulations: The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has awarded your city the dubious honor of having the worst allergies in the United States this spring.

The AAFA\u2019s rankings, which are ordered by a formula taking into account pollen levels, allergy medication used, and number of allergists, change from year to year. East Coasters like to complain about allergies a lot, but their suffering is actually mild compared to that of folks in some inland parts of the United States.

When You See Why, It's Incredible. Another example of a beautiful and unique dress is one that a teenager hand-painted and wore to her high school graduation party. The result was simply spectacular. Then there's the story of a boyfriend who taught himself to sew so that he could make a prom dress for his date. That's love. In his case, it actually led to paying gigs! But, today's story is about toilet paper. It doesn't really seem like the kind of material (can we even call it material?) that would be used for making clothing; however, one woman actually made a wedding dress out of toilet paper. Sure, toilet paper is white, but a wedding dress and toilet paper usually don't belong in the same sentence. Amber Mills, a veteran Marine, is used to challenges. First of all, she was a Marine. Second of all, she has multiple sclerosis. She's also a mom. Mills decided to enter a Toilet Paper Wedding Dress Contest from Charmin, and she ended up getting the third place prize.

Combining Handheld and Console Development So how is Nintendo going to make all these new games? Well, it\u2019s due to an interesting internal change with how Nintendo makes games. In early 2016, Nintendo told business newspaper Nikkei that the company had combined their console and handheld development. While this change appears to be a change in hardware development, the article notes \"Nintendo is hoping the move will encourage further connectivity between console and portable devices, including the implementation of handheld devices as console controllers, and game data sharing so players can continue playing their console game on their handheld when away from the couch.\" Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reported that the system may very well be a hybrid citing development insiders (who had received development kits). Specifically, they state \"People familiar with the development plans said Nintendo would likely include both a console and at least one mobile unit that could either be used in conjunction with the console or taken on the road for separate use.\" Based on this, it looks very likely that the Nintendo NX could have combined console and handheld game development. Combining handheld and console development makes sense as the 8th Generation has been plagued", "This almost free item is one of the most important things you can keep in your car.

Watch the security line at DIA grow. From 4:30, to 5:00, to 5:45. Now it's almost to baggage claim @DenverChannel pic.twitter.com/r9sWcNrK0m \u2014 Jason Gruenauer (@JGonTV) May 26, 2016 The lines aren't invariably nightmarish at every airport, all day long. Still, many people, including me, have missed flights because they arrived at the airport at what used to be a reasonable time and found themselves still trapped in line as their flight took off. The immediate reason for the long lines is pretty simple: Americans are flying more than ever, and the TSA hasn't grown quickly enough to keep up. But the current mess is also a direct result of the TSA's last crisis. Last fall, the agency got in trouble for not doing enough to keep weapons and explosives off planes, and stepped up security as a result. The TSA has serious problems with culture and management, including disciplining whistleblowers who called out problems. But it's also stuck between a rock and a hard place, the victim of a political consensus that insists airport security must be perfectly airtight without ever being even the slightest bit inconvenient. Lines are getting longer partly because more people are flying In one sense, the", "\"Game of Thrones\" writers reveal the one epic scene they had to cut.

The pronouncement came in a two-page memo from Obama's doctor following the president's physical exam last month. It's the first report on Obama's health that the White House has released in nearly three years. The information was made public after repeated inquiries by The Associated Press into the lack of transparency about the president's physical well-being. The White House's previous update on Obama's health came in October 2011. Obama continues to make healthy lifestyle choices, according to the report, by eating a healthy diet, exercising daily and remaining tobacco-free. Obama is a former smoker who is often seen chewing nicotine gum. He suffers from mild tenderness in the muscle beneath his right foot, which he treats by taking an occasional ibuprofen tablet. \"The president's overall health is excellent,\" Obama's doctor, Ronny L.

In its quest to figure out how to make money and possibly move closer to an initial public offering, Snapchat is taking a huge dive into video advertising. Yes, according to Adweek, Snapchat will now run video ads in between your friends\u2019 stories to give advertisers a better shot at reaching some of the company\u2019s 150 million daily users. The video ads will be known by the extremely clever name Snap Ads Between Stories.

All of our rumors up to this point have implied that Wolverine 3 would take inspiration from Weapon X will be the film\u2019s title. While this might not be the title many were expecting, it actually makes perfect sense. The Weapon X program was the experiment that turned Logan into Wolverine and what he went through there has been a key part of his character since the first X-Men movie. We fully expect that Wolverine 3 will be some sort of true finale for the character, and so that may very well mean finding some closure with the experiment that created him. The first Wolverine standalone film X-Men Origins: Wolverine dealt specifically with the events of the Weapon X program, however, that film was viewed as one of the weak links in the X-Men franchise to date, and its events were essentially retconned out of existence following Naturally, calling Wolverine 3 Weapon X also forges a connection to X-Men: Apocalypse. As that scene concluded, the feral Wolverine ran off into the night. Could this film build on that conclusion? This shrouds the characters' past in some mystery once again, If the film is called Weapon X, but is also taking inspiration", "NJ police searching for 2 men who they say tried to abduct a 10-year-old girl when she was doing this.

Some may have been covering their ears, while others thoroughly examined each and every detail -- good or bad -- of the live-action update of the 1991 animated classic. So how did the remake compare to the original? Well, that\u2019s still up for interpretation, but one thing is clear: There were many plot twists and updates that gave the newly released \"Beauty and Beast\" a completely different feel from the original. Questions were answered, characters changed and some key scenes and moments in the film made the remake stand out -- not simply as a copycat but as a film that can stand on its own. Here\u2019s a look at nine ways the \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake differed from the original: Warning: This post contains spoilers. In the remake, Belle (Emma Watson) is more than a bold, beautiful bookworm and devoted daughter -- she\u2019s also a teacher and inventor.

First, some context: TV news shows almost never cover climate change, which ought to be one of the most aggressively-reported issues around, given that, y'know, it's a dire threat to the planet and everyone on it. A recent study from Media Matters found that the Sunday shows on NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox spent a combined 27 minutes on the topic in the whole of 2013. Meet the Press was singled out as \"failing to offer a single substantial mention of climate change\" for the entire year. So, when \"MTP\" does finally decide that the issue merits its consideration, what does it do?

This April's North South Foundation bee in Shawnee, Kan., might seem like an obscure place to find the spelling world's two biggest stars. Mostly, it looked like the sort of geeky local bee I might have attended as a kid\u2014except everyone there was Indian. Inside Shawnee's Hindu Temple and Cultural Center, 23 awkward kids took turns passing a microphone back and forth in a hushed beige auditorium. No spotlights, no podium, just cringe-inducing feedback on the P.A. system. And for the record, the spelling was a-t-r-o-c-i-o-u-s.

Considering that it\u2019s happening all the time, everywhere, all across the world, there\u2019s a lot that scientists still don\u2019t know about the female orgasm. Although the debate over the chemistry of female ejaculation has been settled, it\u2019s still not definitively clear how many types of female orgasms there are. The most tantalizing question of all, though, has barely been addressed \u2013 namely, what is the evolutionary point of the female orgasm? Writing in the Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution , a team of scientists at Yale University think they\u2019ve come up with an answer. Rather than merely evolving as a trait to accompany the male orgasm, which some presumed was an adaptation to encourage pair-bonding between partners, these researchers have concluded that it was once the key biological trigger required for ovulation to take place. When women orgasm, they release two hormones, oxytocin and prolactin. In the females of wild placental mammals , this type of hormonal discharge actively causes ovulation to begin, and without it, pregnancy would not be possible. The male and female orgasms work together, so to speak, to begin ovulation.

A team of second year undergraduates have today (8 June 2016) opened a Resilience Food Farm on campus, combining fish farming and vegetable growing \u2013 using waste from the fish as a fertiliser. The fish will produce ammonia, which is translated into nitrates by beneficial bacteria. The plants then suck the nitrates out of the water and the clean water goes back to the fish. The process is known as aquaponics, combining hydroponics (growing vegetables in water) and aquaculture (growing fish). The students will grow leafy greens such as chard, lettuce, rocket and sorrel, and experiment with broad beans, strawberries and leeks, to test the aquaponics system as a method for producing sustainable food for the future.

Before you freak: We're not talking about those same beer-chugging hiccups, but a painful, unrelenting, severe case of the hiccups that comes on out of nowhere, says neurologist Diana Greene-Chandos, MD, director of neuroscience critical care at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. These are hiccups so bad you just might bring yourself to the emergency room. When they truly are a sign of a stroke, if you're paying really close attention to your body, you might also notice chest pain, all-over numbness, or a bit of blurred vision, but, Greene-Chandos says, the hiccups are often so severe, those other symptoms fly under the radar. Crazy, right? In fact, no one really knows about this whole hiccup thing. Greene-Chandos's team recently polled 1,000 women and found just 10 percent knew hiccups can be a sign of stroke.

At the state convention this weekend, the final step in the process, Sanders supporters hoped to secure the lion\u2019s share of the remaining 12 delegates. Instead, the delegate allocation rules were abruptly changed and Clinton was awarded 7 of the 12 delegates. State party chair, Roberta Lange, told caucus-goers that the \"ruling by the Chair is not debatable; we cannot be challenged and I move that...and I announce that the rules have been passed by the body.\" Predictably, a chorus of boos followed and the convention was forced to end on a frenzied note. What happened in Nevada is likely to happen elsewhere. The perception that the DNC has thrown its institutional support behind Clinton has only deepened the internal divide within the party. The Sanders wing is pissed off, and rightfully so. The establishment support for Clinton was apparent in the superdelegate gap.

You know the type. Just picture \"awful,\" that's him. One of the horrible things about this man was that he didn't listen to me. Ever. Even if he asked a question, he'd ignore the answer. One night we were at a family member's house and he spotted something curious lying on the coffee table. \"What's that?\" he asked. \"Don't touch it,\" I said, even as he reached for the thing on the table. Did he listen? What do you think, reader? He grabbed it &started to fiddle with it. \"Put that down, you don't want to touch it\" I said. \"But what is it?\" he asked, still fiddling. \"It's -- put it down, don't touch that button,\" I said.

So when someone asks film series star, Daniel Radcliffe, if he\u2019d be willing to reprise his role as Harry Potter for a new movie, it\u2019s all theoretical. But let\u2019s face it \u2013 chances are strong you\u2019re curious about what he says. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re only human, and a Muggle at that. Radcliffe was in attendance at the Deauville Film Festival, where he was the recipient of the Rising Star Award, and The Hollywood Reporter asked him the big question. Would he say no to another Harry Potter movie down the line? His answer is diplomatic and the exact kind of response you\u2019d expect from a young actor who has grown up carefully navigating the spotlight: I\u2019m never going to close the door; that would be a stupid thing to do.

Ikhbariya TV also claimed that the rebels tried to take with them captives they had seized and were holding in the rebel enclave. However, a military news service run by Lebanon\u2019s pro-Damascus Hizbullah group said the evacuation had been halted partly due to a failure to evacuate wounded people from two Shia villages besieged by rebels in Idlib. It also cited previous reasons given for the suspension of the evacuation: that rebels had sought to take prisoners with them and had bombarded a road due to be used by the buses set to conduct the evacuation from the two villages, al-Foua and Kefraya. Hizbullah, an Iran-backed Lebanese Shia group, is fighting on the side of president Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019s civil war.

By Jena Pincott \"You're Taking The Wrong Chill Pill\" Try this to preempt stress-triggered pig-outs: two 1/4-cup servings daily of yogurt that is (preferably) unsweetened and (crucially) probiotic-enriched (look for B. animalis, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus). After a month of this regime, volunteers in an fMRI study at UCLA's School of Medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. One explanation: The good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. While most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author Kirsten Tillisch, MD, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. Ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers. \"Your Housemates Influence You More Than You Think\" OK, you don't like yogurt. Or kimchi, tempeh, sauerkraut or other \"friendly-flora\" foods. But if your housemates eat them -- good news!

He paid in cash for his room, telling the receptionist he didn\u2019t have a credit card because he had just filed for bankruptcy. Upstairs in room 201, he undressed to his boxer shorts, folded his clothes neatly on to the coffee table and lowered himself into the bath tub, tucking a pillow behind his back.

For the previous seven months, Vahey had been teaching history at the American Nicaraguan School, one of 193 schools around the world supported by the US government to promote US-style education.

Eatsa, an innovative, vegetarian automated restaurant chain, which just opened its first East Coast location (in New York) on Wednesday, is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customers a one-of-a-kind food experience. The tech-savvy restaurant aims to offer fresh, affordable food fast, but with an unconventional twist: It replaces the presence of good old-fashioned cashiers and waiters with... robots. Instead of the usual face-to-face ordering and pickup, customers at Eatsa simply order their food by means of in-store kiosks, online or through an app on their phones. The food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass \"cubby\" displaying the customer's name, and they're free to chow down. This means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse?  The concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying.

From the get-go, Sony and Marvel have stated that they are making this next Spider-Man reboot an all-inclusive affair, with a very diversified cast. Traditionally, Mary Jane Watson is portrayed as a white woman with red hair who is based on Ann-Margret from the movie Bye Bye Birdie. In the original Sam Raimi trilogy, she was played by Kirsten Dunst, who came under fire at the time for not being a natural red head. She was later portrayed by Shailene Woodley in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, but her scenes were all cut and she was removed from the movie. Some speculated that online uproar from fans who hated seeing Woodley in the role is what got her canned. On the flip side, Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman, who is an actress, singer, and dancer, has an African-American father and a white mother. Some fans are upset that the dark haired beauty just doesn't fit the traditional Mary Jane template. The controversy stems from her race, but Shailene Woodley certainly got it way worse when she was cast as Mary Jane, and the first set photos emerged of her in character, which showed her as a motorcycle riding tomboy.

A group of 50 cattle genetically engineered to contain human DNA is able to produce human antibodies that may fight off the Ebola virus, according to SAB Biotherapeutics, which has developed these specialty cattle. Donating plasma from Ebola survivors to Ebola patients may help patients heal, because survivors' blood contains Ebola-fighting antibodies. After these cows get vaccinated against serious diseases, their bodies make antibodies in response and in large quantities. This may make more blood with Ebola antibodies available to patients with the illness. \"From these animals, we can collect 30 to 60 liters of plasma each month,\" Eddie Sullivan, president and CEO of SAB Biotherapeutics, told NBC News. \"That translates into something between 500 to 1,000 human doses per month per animal.\" Researchers at SAB had been working with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases to test this approach on another disease, hantavirus, but switched gears once Ebola became an epidemic.

Dumbledore denied Voldemort\u2019s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from \u2018lasting more than a year\u2019. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term\u2019s end, to prevent anything \"bad\" or \"dangerous\" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn\u2019t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn\u2019t apply to her.\" Obversa says, \"Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall\u2019s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet. Thus, when Dumbledore succeeded Dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of Transfiguration.\" We know that Minerva McGonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there? As a result of Pottermore, we know a bit more about Professor McGonagall\u2019s backstory (which is extremely similar to Lord Voldermort\u2019s background). McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore\u2019s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall", "The Mind Blowing Match Up For Nick Diaz That No One Saw Coming. Diaz poured a large dose of cold water on the potential matchup, claiming that he was the top name in the sport considering all the people that wanted to fight him. \"I want to fight the best guy.

Speaking yesterday, Wachira was referencing the results of a survey by Mahidol University's Institute for Population and Social Research, reported The Nation. We all know about the Thai disinclination for walking anywhere, but Wachira noted that so many hours without physical activity were bad for Thai people\u2019s health. \"Foreign research shows being physically inactive hurts the metabolism and control of the blood-sugar level.

The city of San Fernando holds a passion play, culminating in the actual nailing of at least three devotees to wooden crosses in front of spectators.

(Debit cards, EBT cards, and cash are still accepted as payment too.) Costco members who have Costco AmEx accounts should have already been sent new Costco Visa cards in the mail automatically. In many ways, the card change works to the benefit of Costco members. The new Visa cards provide members with 4% cash back on up to $7,000 of gas purchases annually, plus 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back for Costco purchases, and 1% back on everything else. The old Costco AmEx card, by comparison, gave 3% cash back on gas purchases up to $4,000 annually. In the case of both of the new and old Costco-affiliated credit cards, the cash back can be redeemed only at Costco.

Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones. Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food? What the heck does organic mean anyway? Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed. \"By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,\" Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email. When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says \"100 percent organic\" indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. \"Organic,\" on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while \"made with organic ingredients\" is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients.

The most dangerous act on this years\u2019 Britains Got Talent is so risky it\u2019s been banned from filming live during the semi-finals. Sword swallower and BGT favourite Alex Magala has previously confessed that his death-defying acts put his life at risk, and he\u2019s now been ordered by ITV to pre-record his performance in case it goes wrong. During his first audition, producers ensured that paramedics were on standby when he dropped from the ceiling with a sword down his throat. And his latest performance has proved even more dangerous \u2013 climbing a pole blindfolded before sliding down, stopping just inches from spinning power drills. Youtube The 26-year-old revealed he tried to persuade producers to let him perform live along with the other semi-finalists, but they refused, saying there is no \u2018safety button\u2019 on his act.

Passengers aboard easyJet flight 8275 from Gatwick to Madrid on Wednesday encountered two surprises. The first: they were kept waiting on the ground for nearly two hours because of a strike by French air-traffic controllers. The second: all six crew members on the Airbus A320 were women. The arithmetic shows this to be a rare event. While many cabin crew are female, men outnumber women by around 16 to one on the flight deck.  When I checked on the flight-deck gender split three months ago with all the leading airlines serving UK passengers, a remarkably consistent pattern emerged: at British Airways, easyJet, Monarch and Ryanair, just 6 per cent of crew are female. Flybe performs slightly better than the norm; 7.5 per cent of the airline\u2019s pilots are female, while just 3 per cent of Thomson\u2019s pilots are women. All other things being equal, only one flight in about 300 to and from the UK is flown by two women; 17 have have one male and one female pilot; and the remaining 282 are two-man operations. But not all other things are equal, because the proportion of captains who are female is even smaller than that 6 per cent.

It seems that Rogue One is officially breaking form, with the iconic opening crawl likely not being featured at the beginning of the movie.

It's not quite as scary as swimming in a glass-bottom pool above the Shanghai skyline or as overwhelming as the world's largest pool in Chile, but the Y-40 pool in Italy is equally cool. The pool was designed by architect Emanuele Boaretto and is housed on the grounds of Hotel Terme Millepini near Padua, Italy. According to the project's website, Boaretto's goal was \"to build the best swimming pool in the world.\" While that measurement is a bit subjective, the pool is Guinness World Records-certified as the world's deepest swimming pool for diving. Y-40's name is a reference to its depth, with the \"-40\" denoting that the pool plunges about 40 meters -- or about 131 feet -- at its deepest. (Guinness claims it's even deeper). According to Guinness, the pool holds 1,135,939 gallons of thermal water and is currently \"used for dive training, leisure diving and scientific research.\" It's easy to visit the hotel and explore the adjoining Y-40 pool, as you can just sign up to book a hotel room and a dive at the same time. Visitors who don't feel like diving can walk through the pool's transparent tunnel to see divers and then venture out to explore", "'DWTS': And the Latest Celebrity to Leave Is... After a blah blah Cha Cha, Amber Rose became the latest celebrity to leave the ABC show.

Even cooler, the researchers showed that, when incorporated into human cells, this radiation-blocking protein also reduced the damage to human DNA from X-rays by an impressive 40 percent. \"We were really surprised,\" one of the researchers, Takuma Hashimoto from the University of Tokyo, told AFP \"It is striking that a single gene is enough to improve the radiation tolerance of human cultured cells.\" The team performed their genetic analysis on a specific species of water bear called Ramazzottius varieornatus, which is arguably the toughest of all tardigrade species. Among other anomalies, what they found in the tiny creature's genome was a protein called Dsup - short for \"damage suppressor\" - which suppresses radiation damage, as well as the damage caused by desiccation, which be just as destructive to DNA. (An experiment last year showed that water bears can survive being totally dehydrated by turning into glass.) Because it's so much easier to study the animal's genome within mammalian cells, the researchers manipulated the DNA in human cells to get them to produce pieces of the tardigrade's genome - which is where they noticed that Dsup could also protect human cells. If Dsup could also be transplanted into live humans, it could", "Dad Shocked To See What Baby's Snack Can Says After Daughter Nearly Died.

The 6-foot, 7-inch magician weighed 322 pounds over a year ago, when doctors discovered a 90% blockage in his heart. The father of two then decided to take drastic measures to see his young kids grow up. Under medical supervision, Jillette embarked on the \"potato diet,\" eating only plain potatoes for two whole weeks. After subsisting on spuds alone, he started phasing in vegetable stews for added nutrients. Despite the crazy restrictions, Jillette stuck to it, losing 75 pounds in just 83 days without exercising. The boring menu helped the 61-year-old break bad eating habits he'd fallen into before. \"I'm not good at moderation. I wanted to do hardcore stuff,\" Jillette told Good Morning America. \"I wanted to lose the sense of eating socially... it was just a way to lose all the habits I had gotten into.\" But the potato diet won't work magic for everyone. \"While there's no doubt that potatoes \u2014 just like all vegetables\u2014 are supremely nutritious, eliminating almost all other food groups in totality is not only dangerous, but can really backfire,\" says Jaclyn London, R.D., Nutrition Director at the Good Housekeeping Institute.

The timing is important since it is just ahead of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s speech at the UN General Assembly. Several US Congressmen condemned the recent Uri attack and came out in support for India. One of the Congressmen who introduced the bill, also made the following statement. \"Pakistan\u2019s reckless behavior in this regard is a serious security risk to its neighbors \u2013 and India unfortunately pays the price all too often. We condemn this tragic attack, as well as Pakistan\u2019s support for many criminals like the ones who carried it out, and stand firm in our commitment to our friends in India\" This is the first time in many years that there are formal talks about designating Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism.

And that\u2019s the truth too many people refuse to acknowledge. It\u2019s the most difficult part of the campus rape culture destroying the lives of so many young women: acknowledging who their rapists are. Turner, 20, was convicted of sexually attacking an unconscious woman behind a dumpster at Stanford University after a fraternity party. It was a violent, brutal attack, and he was caught by two passersby, who tackled him when he tried to run away. The rape charges were dropped because it was Turner\u2019s fingers, along with dirt and pine needles, that went inside his victim, not his sexual organ. Was that calculated on his part? Was he trying to avoid leaving his DNA in her body? The jury convicted Turner of sexual assault, which doesn\u2019t sound quite as horrible as rape. But let\u2019s forget the legal terms and look up the word rape in the dictionary.

KRDO first reported about local marijuana advocate Tim Klob's petition where he helped gather nearly 600 signatures to put a measure on the November ballot to allow recreational marijuana sales and industrial hemp grows in the southeastern Colorado town of La Junta. \"I see this as a game changer for our economy,\" Klob said to KRDO. \"There\u2019s no other industry knocking on our door right now.\" Unfortunately for Klob and for the citizens supporting the measure, the petition effort failed because Klob inadvertently violated Colorado law when he didn't staple each petition volunteer's affidavit with the signatures they collected when he turned the documents in to the La Junta city clerk's office.

The flat 8-bit pixel art revival has been with us for some time now. It's sometimes employed for a self-consciously nostalgic feel, harking back to the touchstones of the developer's childhood in the 1980s. Sometimes, it's used to convey ironic detachment. But most developers employ the style because they simply love the stark simplicity of the constraints it imposes But lately, there has been a rise in a low-poly aesthetic, similar to that of early PS1, Sega Saturn, and N64 game graphics. This emerging trend--evident in games like Back in 1995, MacBat 64, Racing Apex, morphe\u0302, and Else Heart.Break()--may simply be a younger cohort of indie developers who want to celebrate or emulate the titles that made them fall in love with games. But like pixel art before it, it's not as simple as wanting to recapture childhood. The deliberate choice of a minimalist low-poly art style is a movement toward making the player use their imagination. It's a way of creating a visual style that simplifies and clarifies aspects of the game. It's yet another tool that lets developers keep a clear vision of what their game should be.

For the price, these crinkles are huge\u2014each one is three inches in diameter and half an inch thick, with considerable heft to it. Pull a crinkle apart\u2014it\u2019s very dense, and very moist. I love that it\u2019s really more like a half-baked, dollar pancake-shaped brownie than your typical small, dry, boring convenience store crinkle. The surface, lightly dusted with confectioner\u2019s sugar, just barely holds the structure together, and provides a subtle, cookie-like textural contrast to the chewy interiors.

Exhibit A: Anatoli Petrovich Bugorski, a Russian scientist who has the distinction of being the only person to ever stick his head in a running particle accelerator. Shockingly, he also managed to survive the ordeal and, all things considered, came out without too much damage. Bugorski was a researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Protvino, working with the Soviet particle accelerator: The Synchrotron U-70. On July 13, 1978, Bugorski was checking a malfunctioning piece of equipment. As he was leaning over the piece of equipment, he stuck his head through the part of the accelerator that the proton beam was running through. He reported seeing a flash that was \"brighter than a thousand suns\", but did not feel any pain when this happened. The beam itself measured 2000 gray as it entered Bugorski\u2019s skull and about 3000 gray when it exited on the other side. A \"gray\" is an SI unit of energy absorbed from ionizing radiation. One gray is equal to the absorption of one joule of radiation energy by one kilogram of matter. An example where this is commonly used is in X-rays. For reference, absorption of over 5 grays at any time usually leads to", "Did \u2018Wheel Of Fortune\u2019 CHEAT a Contestant Out of $1 Million Opportunity Over a Technicality? Did the massively popular game show \"Wheel of Fortune\" cheat a contestant out of a chance to win a million dollars? That\u2019s what some are wondering after what happened recently on the show. It appears that a curious pronunciation of the phrase \"Corner Curio Cabinet\" is at the center of the controversy. That\u2019s because recent contestant Paul Atkinson landed on the tiny million-dollar slice of the wheel, correctly guessed there were a some Cs in the puzzle, and then decided to solve it. The only problem? He pronounced it \"Corno curo cabinet.\" The Wheel of Fortune rules clearly state that proper pronunciation of the word or phrase is required to win each puzzle. So host Pat Sajak had to break the bad news to Paul. \"Well, it\u2019s one of those\u2013 it just didn\u2019t come out the way you intended it to,\" Sajak told a flummoxed Atkinson after the next contestant immediately solved the puzzle. \"Paul, you\u2019ve proved what several players have proven and I prove almost on a nightly basis: Sometimes your mouth says what your brain doesn\u2019t intend for it to,\" Sajak later said. ABC reports that the unlucky Atkinson claimed he had never seen the word before and that", "7 Surprising Reasons Your Dog Should Sleep On Your Bed Every Night. People have been saying it for years.

The 24 malls that list Tesla as a tenant average $940 in sales per square foot, compared to $835 for those without the carmaker in their directory, according to research by Green Street Advisors. Tesla's correlation to high-performing malls mimics that of another star Silicon Valley tenant: Apple. A separate report issued by Goldman Sachs last year found that of the top 100 U.S. malls, 75 percent house an Apple. Both Tesla and Apple sell in-demand products with high price tags, which helps drive their store productivity. As a result, the malls in which they reside experience similar success. However, it's worth noting that both retailers seek out locations in well-to-do centers and geographies, making it a bit of a \"chicken versus the egg\" scenario. For instance, Tesla has locations in three of what Green Street has ranked as America's top 10 malls \u2014 The Village at Corte Madera and Century City, both in California, and Hawaii's Ala Moana Center.

I\u2019ve enjoyed plenty of pies made from canned pumpkin pure\u0301e and evaporated milk. They are perfectly smooth and mild and custard-like, and they make everyone happy. This pie is not that pie. At least, not anymore. This is that pie after it left home and learned some things. This is that pie come back with secrets and scars and stories to tell.

Innovation Is Not Just About Talent I have to admit at the outset that when I hire senior-level people whom I expect to be innovative it is never just because of talent, brains, or even skills. Figuring out if they have the competency to do the job is actually pretty easy (see my article \" 6 Interview Questions You Must Ask if You Want to Hire the Best People \"). What is infinitely harder to judge is the degree to which they are truly innovative and committed to their ideas. The challenge, of course, is that many people can make a great first impression--but end up being someone totally different when you have to live with them eight to 12 hours a day. I've seen the strain that the wrong partnership can have. What starts off as a blissful union can turn into a nightmare when the underlying values and ambitions of partners don't align. Bringing on board a senior-level individual in a small business is crucial and will have a deep, long-term impact on your company. And partnerships are so hellish to untangle that companies can be ruined in the process. So you really need to get it right from", "Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice. As a professor who has taught Christian ethics for 39 years, I think their analysis is incorrect. Now that Trump has won the GOP nomination, I think voting for Trump is a morally good choice. American citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season. Close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election. We still need to respect each other and thank God that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics. And we need to keep talking with each other \u2013 because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences. This is my contribution to that discussion. A good candidate with flaws I do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do. I did not support Trump in the primary season. I even spoke against him at a pastors\u2019 conference in February. But now I plan to vote for him.

Google has supported the display of Emoji characters in search results on mobile since 2012, but only added desktop support last month. Following that, Search Engine Land was tipped off to the fact that Expedia has added Emoji characters to the titles of some but not all of its pages. For example, a search for \"miami hotels\" returns an Expedia page that has a bed Emoji before the text page title, while a search for \"portland flights\" includes an Expedia page that has an airplane seat Emoji before the text page title. Interestingly but perhaps not surprisingly, it appears that Expedia has excluded some of the United States' largest cities from its Emoji test. Results for searches related to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, for instance, don't have the Emoji page titles. Will it work, and long-term? Search Engine Land's Barry Schwartz says he expected companies to experiment with Emoji page titles \"hoping the additional imagery in the search results would lead to more visibility and a higher click through rate.\" And, at least initially, there's", "Twenty years ago tonight, a game froze in time and something happened that had never happened before or since.

They were there to do something that had never been done before: retire a number, Jackie Robinson's 42, across an entire sport. And to do their part to ensure that the power of Robinson's major league debut, 50 years earlier to the day, would keep resonating through history. This is the story of that night, April 15, 1997 -- and its aftermath -- through the eyes of the men and women who lived it.

Clinton\u2019s campaign has (at least for the moment) stopped spending money to put ads on the air in Colorado and Virginia. (In both states, according to RealClearPolitics polling averages, Clinton is ahead of Trump by an average of 11 points.) The pro-Clinton Super PAC Priorities USA is \"going dark\" for a month in those two states and in Pennsylvania (where Clinton is polling about 9 points ahead of Trump). On the surface, this looks like an act of confidence \u2014 if not outright complacency. But that\u2019s not the whole story. The Hillary Clinton campaign might be pulling its ad buys out of conventional swing states like Colorado and Virginia, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s putting effort into unexpected places. Since the conventions, the Hillary Clinton campaign has expanded its operations in Arizona and put full-time staff into Georgia, a state that few could have imagined Democrats would compete in come 2016.

Graydon Carter wrote about it in April\u2019s Vanity Fair. New life was breathed into scrutiny of Trump\u2019s hands during the Republican primary. In February, Senator Marco Rubio joked, \"You know what they say about men with small hands,\" after saying Trump had the hands of someone 5 feet, 2 inches tall.

Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy has been studying first impressions alongside fellow psychologists Susan Fiske and Peter Glick for more than 15 years, and has discovered patterns in these interactions. In her new book, \"Presence,\" Cuddy says that people quickly answer two questions when they first meet you: Can I trust this person? Can I respect this person? Psychologists refer to these dimensions as warmth and competence, respectively, and ideally you want to be perceived as having both. Interestingly, Cuddy says that most people, especially in a professional context, believe that competence is the more important factor. After all, they want to prove that they are smart and talented enough to handle your business. But in fact, warmth, or trustworthiness, is the most important factor in how people evaluate you. \"From an evolutionary perspective,\" Cuddy says, \"it is more crucial to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.\" It makes sense when you consider that in cavemen days it was more important to figure out if your fellow man was going to kill you and steal all your possessions than if he was competent enough to build a good fire.

SANTA FE, N.M., Sept 6 - Searchers in New Mexico found the body of a missing firefighter on Friday, a week after he disappeared in rugged wilderness in the Santa Fe National Forest when he rode out on an all-terrain vehicle to check on a small wildfire. The body of Token Adams, 41, was located by a Native American search team in an area of the forest called Stable Mesa, said David Shell, a spokesman for the national incident management team called in to aid the search. His death comes amid a particularly tragic season for wildland firefighters, as dozens of large and fast-moving wildfires have raged across the drought-parched U.S. West this year, straining national firefighting resources. Nineteen members of a squad of elite hotshot firefighters died in an Arizona fire in June, and last month in Oregon a firefighter died when a tree fell on him. Adams, who was married with one child, worked as an engine captain for a fire crew at the Jemez Ranger District. He disappeared last Friday after he went out to check on a lightning-sparked in the Jemez Mountain District of the forest. \"They believe at this time that the cause of death was", "This Is the 1 Thing Ruining Your Relationship. While behaviors and emotions matter in relationships, the emphasis we put on them forces one of our central human attributes onto the back burner: our thoughts. What role do our thoughts and beliefs play in the success or failure of our relationships? As it turns out, one common thought pattern is highly toxic for relationships. You can view it as a core belief or as a mental stance... but I prefer to think of it as a cognitive trap. The trap is this: you believe that there is only one true reality. You believe in finding The Truth with a capital \"T\" and anyone who doesn\u2019t buy into the truth you\u2019ve uncovered is objectively wrong. Simply put, when your mind can\u2019t accept and validate multiple realities, your relationships will suffer. Some common relationship maxims hint at the shortcomings of this belief. For example, \"There are three sides to every story: your side, my side, and the truth.\" This simple truism highlights an understanding that my truth is not The Truth .

How They Play What humans would take as fighting, or, at the very least, wrestling, cats find all in good fun. Big or small, they like to get a workout and interact by rolling around and pawing at their peers. It rarely turns violent when this is the intent, and actually is most common around lions, the most social of any cat species. 2. How They Rest Cats of all sizes and walks of life love their sleep. The lazy beasts get in 16 to 20 hours of shut eye and lounging per day and with it comes a lot of yawns. Hunting takes a lot of energy for any animal, and even housecats have that need to sleep in hardwired in their DNA. 3. How They Clean Themselves All cats groom themselves to stay clean, using their rough tongue to course through their fur. And cheetahs, like house cats, tend to purr when cleaning themselves, whereas the other big cats are a little stoic when practicing their hygiene. 4. How Moody They Get Cats are fickle animals across the board, as most human owners can", "Why Indie Filmmakers Should Care About Net Neutrality. While there are, of course, more opportunities for creating work than ever before, filmmakers are also increasingly facing roadblocks to getting that work seen by the public. This is where Net Neutrality comes into play. The past generation has seen an explosion in the volume of content consumed over the Internet, accompanied by a lack of infrastructure to support the flow of that information. If there isn\u2019t enough bandwidth for all of the content that a set of subscribers to an ISP (such as Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.) require, then the ISP either has to build additional bandwidth or ration the existing bandwidth. A lack of bandwidth to support video streaming manifests for the viewer as \"buffering\" messages and stuttering playback. These pauses deliver a disappointing experience for the viewer and it can (and will) cause them to seek out a better option. Net Neutrality is important because it affects how and when this rationing occurs. If viewers are already paying for content, they will be hard-pressed to pay a second time to optimize the viewing of that content. At the same time, any content provider (including Fandor) wants to make sure that their customers have the best experience possible and", "State moves one step closer to ending medical marijuana \"chaos\". Authored by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano (D-San Francisco), the measure, AB 1894, would create uniform rules to govern the state's multibillion-dollar medical marijuana industry. Although California became the first state to legalize cannabis for medicinal use in 1996, the state has yet to establish a set of standards guiding the cultivation, production and sale of the plant, which has led to what Ammiano described to The Huffington Post as \"chaos.\" \"I am optimistic that we can continue to work with all parties to finally create regulation that will satisfy all needs,\" Ammiano said in a statement Friday, \"from federal law enforcement down to the very sick patients who depend on the health benefits only marijuana can provide.\" California currently leaves it up to local governments to decide how they want to implement the state's medical marijuana law. As a result, some cities, like San Francisco and Oakland, have established clear-cut systems that dictate where dispensaries can operate and impose fees that directly enrich their coffers. Other places, like San Diego and San Jose, remain largely unregulated, with very little control over where pot-related businesses can operate. San Jose lawmakers are currently mulling legislation that would effectively make it impossible for medical marijuana", "You\u2019ll Never Believe What This Family Saw in the Sky Outside Their House in Finland. \"It was cold and very foggy, the temperature was around -10 degrees Celsius,\" said Ha\u0308nninen. \"When the clouds began to break, there were rainbow colours in the sky and a halo spanning 360 degrees!

The couple, Jason Pickel and Darren Black Bear, had the idea to get married through the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Tribal Court, an autonomous Native American judiciary in Concho, Okla., that isn't subject to state laws. But when Pickel and Black Bear first asked the sovereign nation to perform the ceremony, they were denied. It was 2009, and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) made their union impossible. But on Oct. 10, 2013, less than four months after the Supreme Court struck down DOMA, Pickel and Black Bear received an official marriage license from the tribal court, whose law code surrounding marriage \"does not specify gender,\" Cheyenne and Arapahoe Tribes spokesperson Lisa Liebl told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. The tribal constitution does, however, mandate that both people seeking marriage must have Native American heritage and live within the tribe's jurisdiction -- both requirements Pickel and Black Bear met. \"I was really expecting [to be told] no,\" Pickel told local news station KOCO-TV. \"But they said, 'Yeah, come on down. It's 20 bucks.'\" While the couple will still be denied tax breaks on their state returns, notes the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Tribal Tribune, they will now be able to receive federal tax", "These 10 companies help employees pay off their student loans:. To attract and retain millennials, in particular, companies are expanding their employee benefit programs to help reduce student loan debt for their employees. Millennials are heeding the call. Aetna is one of 10 trailblazing companies offering the hottest employee benefit of 2017. (AP Photo/Jessica Hill) In the 2015 American Student Assistance survey, 76% of respondents said that if a prospective employer offered a student loan repayment benefit, it would be a deciding or contributing factor to accept the job. While only 4% of companies currently offer such a benefit, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, and employees are typically responsible for income taxes on the assistance received, expect this percentage to increase in the coming year. Here are 10 trailblazing companies that will help you pay off your student loans faster in 2017: 1.

Men, however, just reach behind their neck and yank their shirt off, much less gracefully. How men do it: How women do it: But why? Social media (especially the Tumblr sleuths) has been on the case, trying to solve this mystery. And the Today Show\u2019s Matt Lauer says we might finally have our answer. \"Men\u2019s shirts have more room, so it\u2019s easier to slip them off over your head; women don\u2019t have that option,\" he posits in the video above. \"I think it\u2019s that men aren\u2019t as flexible and can\u2019t, maybe, get their arms around like that.\" Al Roker has his own theory about why women do it: \"I think it\u2019s hotter.\" If you\u2019re anything like Carson Daly, who says he does the \"Houdini\" method and slips it off through the sleeves so that he won\u2019t stretch out his collar, might we offer a few more techniques: The Wayne\u2019s World: The Nick Slip (it\u2019s Nick Jonas):", "Guess Who Amber Rose Wants to Be Her Next Baby's Father.

But most of us who have used the disposable ones are familiar with that little tab at the end of the chopsticks. We usually break the sticks apart, coupled with rubbing them together to remove any loose splinters, and proceed to chow down the delectable sushi or that sumptuous dumpling you ordered from the local Chinese restaurant. But what if you\u2019ve been wrong all your life and learned that there\u2019s actually a purpose for that little tab there? That little tab was not placed there to keep those sticks together. The chopsticks are not meant to be broken apart just yet without doing this first, important (clever) step that Twitter user Trash Panda discovered. Who would\u2019ve thought that that little bit of wood may actually be useful? The tab needs to be separated from the chopsticks and then it doubles up as a chopsticks holder. This should give you some place to put the sticks while you enjoy your drink. This way, it should keep your table and chopsticks clean. If you think you\u2019ve been living a lie your whole life, you\u2019re not alone.

Daylight saving time is upon us again, and this year we'll lose an hour of sleep -- or reading, or Netflix bingeing -- on Sunday, March 9. The biannual time jump will begin at 2 a.m. local time in participating places and last until Nov. 2, when clocks will fall back an hour. Most with smartphones (who have the \"set automatically\" feature in date and time enabled) will experience the change seamlessly. But, for those using analog alarm clocks, it's probably a good idea to preemptively set those clocks an hour ahead on Saturday night. By jumping forward an hour, regions are able to maximize the hours of sunlight during regular daytime hours. The practice was standardized by the United States in 1966 under the Uniform Time Act. Many countries around the world also observe daylight saving time; however, there are several locations that choose to opt out. The majority of Arizona, for example, does not recognize the time change. (For a complete list of the areas that observe daylight saving time, head over to TimeAndDate.com.) The time shift does have its critics, however.

July 17th 2016 3 Shares We all love carbs, there's no doubting that. We all get to a point, however, when we decide to give them up for the sake of cutting a few pounds. Cutting them out may have better benefits than simply getting that summer body, though. Pablo Kelly, who was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma multiforme, a terminal brain tumour, in 2014, believes that him giving up carbohydrates is the key to him still being alive two years later. Credit: SWNS The 27-year-old refused the traditional treatment of chemotherapy, choosing instead to cut out carbs and switch to a diet high in fruit and vegetables. \"It's all quackery in the eyes of modern medicine but it's clearly helping because I'm still alive,\" Kelly said. \"To my knowledge, I'm the only person with this type of brain tumour that isn't having therapy or surgery and is still alive today.\" Since January last year, CT scans have shown no growth in the 27-year-old's tumour, as in theory, his ketogenic diet reduces the intake of carbs, starving the tumour of fuel it needs and stabilising it. The NHS doesn't recommend the diet, as there's no scientific evidence that proves it has", "Days After \"The Voice\" Star's Murder, Adam And Blake Post Shocking New. The tragedy has left her loved ones, fans, and fellow musicians not only heartbroken, but also confused. However, when I saw this lost footage of Christina Grimmie singing one of the most beautiful hymns of all time, my hope for humanity was restored. Christina Grimmie was one of the few outspoken Christians in the entertainment industry, and she even wrote in the caption of this video \"JESUS CHRIST IS MY LORD AND SAVIOR and [I\u2019m] not at all ashamed of it.\" The video we found features Grimmie performing \"In Christ Alone,\" a powerful, modern Christian song with lyrics that gave me chills \u2014 and left me in tears.

One man had some empty space in his attic, so he decided to fix it up into the man cave of his dreams. Instead of just making it into private space, he decided to put a twist on the room revamp. He converted it into a boat's cabin. As crazy as that sounds, it actually turned out awesome! This is the attic's original entrance. And this is what it used to look like. He modified the angle of the roof with some beams. Don't try this at home yourself. Manipulating pre-engineered structural beams like this could be very dangerous. This was a touchy process, as he was changing the angle of the inside of the attic without compromising the structural integrity of the beams. Then, he needed to find a way to create a new entrance into the attic. The existing opening is in the middle of the hall, which wouldn't work out. So he chipped away at a wall that was adjacent to stairs that led down into the garage. He used this opening as the new entrance up into the attic.

As impressive as her physique is, one of the most incredible parts of Shepherd's story is that she didn't even start working out until she was 56. Shepherd and her sister, Mildred Blackwell, decided to get fit after they tried on swimsuits and weren't happy with what they saw in the mirror. The sisters set their sights on becoming two of the oldest female bodybuilders. However, after Mildred died, the devastated Shepherd ended up with high blood pressure, panic attacks, acid reflux and depression. Then, Shepherd says her sister appeared to her in a dream, urging her to follow through with the bodybuilding dream they had conceived together. Shepherd did, and was declared the World's Oldest Performing Female Bodybuilder by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2010. (Edith Wilma Conner now holds the title.) Since then, Shepherd says her health had dramatically improved. \"I do the same thing day in and day out,\" she says on an episode of \"Oprah Prime\" that also featured Sharon Stone. \"No high blood pressure medicine.

The Americas overtook Africa as the region with the world\u2019s most murders in this year\u2019s report, accounting for 40 percent of the world\u2019s homicides, though that's a somewhat misleading figure as there are wide geographical variations among and within countries in the region.

Our more than 4,000 colleges and universities offer an often bewildering choice of courses, formats and cultures. In these coming weeks, college-bound high school seniors and their parents will try to balance the merits of such issues as big versus small, rural versus urban, research-focused versus teaching-focused, higher cost versus lower cost, prestigious versus less well-known and public versus private.

With only servers as sets, is The Lion King (still no release date, but expect it sometime around 2020, complete with songs from the original, per Disney) to be judged as an animated or a live-action movie when it comes to awards time? And awards could certainly be in the offing. Favreau (Elf, Iron Man) has shown a certain touch for family fare, and seems to be getting more deft with each outing.

After its second weekend at the box office, Warcraft: The Beginning has recouped $377.6 million globally, despite bombing in the U.S. The movie received a meager 32% on metacritic.com and took just $24.4 million in its first five days in American cinemas, and dropped a whopping 73% on its second weekend, bringing in a paltry $6.5 million. Yet the movie remains a financial triumph almost entirely owed to its showing in China, where cinema-goers have so far shelled out more than $200 million on it, even eclipsing Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which took $125.4 million in its entire run in China. Movie experts hail Warcraft\u2019s success as demonstrating the power of China\u2019s booming cinema. Box office revenues grew by almost 50% in China last year and may even surpass the U.S. by as early as next year. There are plans afoot to double the nation\u2019s 35,000 cinema screens before long.

But this was not always the norm among our ancestors. Other primates -- the mammalian group, to which humans belong -- are still polygamous, too. \"The modern monogamous culture has only been around for just 1,000 years,\" says Kit Opie, an evolutionary anthropologist from University College London. Opie describes how the earliest primates -- as early as 75 million years ago -- were solitary and preferred to to live in isolation: \"Adults would only come together to mate.\" As time passed, primates as a whole became more social and evolved to live together in groups, but only humans became truly monogamous. Today, other primate species such as bonobos and chimps mate with multiple individuals in their groups. \"Humans shifted in the other direction,\" Opie said. Why did it happen? Current theories suggest it's down to the preservation of an individual's health -- and their offspring. STDs played a role? As group sizes grew among human societies, from tens of people to hundreds of them, so may have the occurrence of sexually transmitted diseases, according to a recent study Chris Bauch and his colleagues at the University of Waterloo in", "Here Are Some Actually Useful Things You Can Ask Siri.

Michael Lewis, author of The Big Short, told the audience of the Insight Summit that being lazy isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it can make you more successful.

He explained that he doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable doing nothing, if nothing has captured his interest - and it\u2019s better to do nothing than waste time trying not to waste time. He said: People waste years of their lives not being willing to waste hours of their lives. If you mistake busyness for importance, which we do a lot, you're not able to see what really is important. Laziness, he said, stops you from wasting time on things that aren\u2019t worth your time. My laziness serves as a filter. Something has to be really good before I'll decide to work on it.

That\u2019s some impressive tracking ability. But how exactly can a spider do that? And more importantly, should we be afraid? The spider in the video is a jumping spider. They\u2019re part of the family known as salticidae, which contains over 5,000 known species. Jumping spiders are known for their remarkable vision.  Like many (but not all) spiders, they have eight eyes, but their unique positioning grants them a comparatively wide range of vision. Their anterior medial eyes \u2014 the really big ones in front \u2014 are especially good, essentially allowing the spider to see in color. This color vision is used to aggressively hunt prey, which is why the red spot in the video above drives it wild! As if spiders weren\u2019t creepy enough... now I know that they\u2019re probably watching us right now, waiting for the right moment to attack!", "Here\u2019s Fallout 4 Far Harbor DLC Size Compared to the Commonwealth World Map. The third Fallout 4 DLC, Far Harbor was released yesterday and as promised it offers a massive new landmass. A visual comparison between the sizes of the Commonwealth and Far Harbor\u2018s map has been done by Gamepedia which gives us a clear idea about new DLC\u2019s map. Bethesda had already confirmed during the reveal that Far Harbor would be the biggest DLC that the team had worked on in term of landmass. The size of Far Harbor is even bigger than The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\u2018s DLC Shivering Isles, which is massive. Here is the image which will give you an idea of the Far Harbor\u2018s map: And here is the Fallout 4\u2018s basic world map: By scaling the maps we can come to a conclusion that the size of Far Harbor\u2018s map is around 20% that of the Commonwealth\u2019s. You can scale the map of Far Harbor by corresponding one cell to each square on the grid. On the other hand, each square in the Commonwealth map corresponds to four cells (2\u00d72).", "University lauded by White House facing federal sex assault investigation. The investigation comes following a complaint filed against JHU earlier this year under the gender equity law Title IX, first reported by The Huffington Post. The complaint alleges that the Baltimore university failed to keep students safe, and specifically that it knew police were investigating a reported gang rape at a fraternity that continued to throw parties, but did not inform the campus community. JHU spokesman Dennis O'Shea confirmed to HuffPost the university had received notice of the investigation in a letter dated Friday, Aug. 8. JHU President Ronald J. Daniels disclosed the investigation in a campus-wide message Tuesday. \"Nothing remains more important to Johns Hopkins than the welfare of our students, and although the OCR notification does not contain any specific details about the underlying allegations, we will continue to take strong action to improve and to lead in this evolving area of the law and practice,\" Daniels said. The opening of an investigation does not imply the department believes the university has, in fact, violated the law.

They're cute, they're cuddly and they've just been brought back from the brink of extinction. We're talking about the giant panda, a global icon that's just been taken off the endangered list, largely due to Chinese conservation efforts. But how exactly did they do it? It's all about the bamboo China has been trying for years to increase the population of the giant panda. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bamboo makes up for 99% of a panda's diet The bears, China's national icon, were once widespread throughout southern and eastern China but, due to expanding human populations and development, are now limited to areas that still contain bamboo forests. The success is due to Chinese efforts to recreate and repopulate bamboo forests. Bamboo makes up some 99% of their diet, without which they are likely to starve. Pandas must eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. There are now an estimated total of 2,060 pandas, of which 1,864 are adults - a number which has seen their status changed from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\", on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List. \"It's all about restoring the habitats,\" Craig", "Epic Level of Deception, Censorship, Lies and Distortion From the Media!

To be financially ready to retire by 67, retirement-plan provider Fidelity Investments says you should aim to have six times your salary saved by age 50 . Are Americans on track? According to a report from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the mean retirement savings of a family between 44 and 49 years old is $81,347: But that number doesn't tell the whole story. Since so many families have zero savings and since super-savers can pull up the average, the median savings, or those at the 50th percentile, may be a better gauge. The median for families between 44 and 49 is only $6,200. To get closer to Fidelity's recommendation of having six times your salary saved by 50, follow these four steps so your money can grow over time: 1. Contribute as much of your income as possible. Most experts recommend setting aside 10% or more in a tax-advantaged retirement savings account, such as a 401(k) plan . 2. Automate your contributions.

While transgender stories have become more visible in the media, there are many identities and terms outside of the two most culturally accepted genders \u2014 man and woman \u2014 that fall under the trans umbrella. And in many social circles, the vocabulary related to gender identity is unfamiliar or inaccessible. Gender identity is an extremely personal part of who we are, and how we perceive and express ourselves in the world. It is a separate issue entirely from sex, our biological makeup; or sexual orientation, who we are attracted to. There are dozens of dynamic and evolving terms related to how people identify.

Only about 1% of Americans actually have celiac disease, the rare genetic disorder that makes people intolerant to gluten, and that number is not on the rise. In other words, in a room of 100 people, chances are one has celiac. In fact, a study published this month found that the prevalence of celiac has remained basically unchanged since 2009. And as for all those people who say they don't have celiac but are just \"sensitive\" to gluten, a 2013 study out of Monash University suggested that this probably isn't real. Alan Levinovitz, an assistant professor at James Madison University who studies the intersection between religion and medicine and the author of the book \"The Gluten Lie,\" says it essentially comes down to a mix of psychology and behavioral change. In the book, Levinovitz interviews Monash University director of gastroenterology Peter Gibson, who helped write the 2013 study concluding that non-celiac gluten \"intolerance\" was probably not a thing. Gibson says the real reason that many people who have cut gluten claim to feel healthier afterwards is simply because they've changed their diet. \"I've noticed [this] lots of times, even with family members,\" Gibson tells Levinovitz. \"They've", "Remains Of An Enormous Sea Creature Are Baffling Beach-Goers In Wales. The 3.35-meter (11-foot) remains were found near the Kenfig River on Morfa Beach in Port Talbot, South Wales, although it has been there since around February.

First things first, floaters (scientific name: Muscae volitantes) aren't typically a cause for concern. Floaters only exist in your eyeball, not in the external world. And though they appear to wander in the direction that your eye does, they aren't alive by any means. So what are they? Inside your eyeball, there is a gel known as vitreous humour. Over time, the constituents of the vitreous humour break down and drift away, hence the name \"floaters.\" According to TED-Ed, floaters may be bits of protein or tissue, or perhaps red blood cells. These fragments \"cast shadows on the retina,\" and thus, when they're closer to the retina, the stronger the shadow will be. According to All About Vision , floaters will appear more defined when you're looking at a bright backdrop, like a blue sky or a computer screen. In the TED-Ed video, they also discuss the blue field entoptic phenomenon. Ever look at the sky and start to see small dots in your vision? Those small, darting dots are the result of white blood cells moving around the capillaries. Though this phenomenon is unrelated to floaters, it's equally fascinating.", "This Easy iPhone Trick Will Save You Tons of Photo Space.

A trio of people caught attempting to smuggle exotic birds into Singapore were fined several thousands dollars each, reports Asia One. The smugglers, who stuffed six tiny birds into toothpaste boxes in September, were sentenced on Nov. 26 to pay fines of $6,000 each. The birds in question were mata putehs (also known as the Oriental white-eye), which are known for their beautiful voices, according to a statement released by Singapore's Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA). The illegal songbirds were discovered when the smugglers' car was stopped at a routine checkpoint. Three people were fined thousands of dollars for attempting to smuggle exotic birds in toothpaste boxes. \"During the course of inspection, the vigilant ICA officers noticed that three toothpaste boxes inside the centre arm rest console of the car were moving and heard flapping sounds,\" the ICA statement read, in part. \"It aroused their suspicions and they immediately proceeded to conduct further checks.\" Two similar toothpaste boxes were found in a pouch and a bag.

The Trump campaign descended into a familiar messiness after Melania Trump delivered a convention speech Monday echoing lines from Michelle Obama's 2008 convention address. On the tumultuous day that followed, Donald Trump was furious. Melania Trump was humiliated. And the campaign, which had appeared to be on the path to becoming a more organized, disciplined operation, was back on its heels, dealing with swirling accusations and internal finger-pointing that yielded no real answers about what happened. There was no immediate sign of a campaign shakeup Wednesday and it remains unclear whether the incident will have a lasting effect. Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort continued to refuse to acknowledge Wednesday morning that parts of Melania Trump's convention speech were lifted lines, saying the controversy is \"not meaningful at all.\" \"The speech was very effective and communicated those feelings,\" Manafort told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day.\" \"The controversy you're talking about is not meaningful at all.

The theory highlights the paradox that working overtime leads to more income, but less time to spend this income. it also suggests that as income increases, workers are more likely to develop unhealthy habits around working excessively. \"[Becker's Theory] looks at the cost of time as if it were a market good,\" Asebedo said in the statement. \"This theory suggests that the more money you make, the more likely you are to work more.

One theory is that the symbol of the rabbit stems from pagan tradition, specifically the festival of Eostre\u2014a goddess of fertility whose animal symbol was a bunny. Rabbits, known for their energetic breeding, have traditionally symbolized fertility. Eggs are also representative of new life, and it's believed that decorating eggs for Easter dates back to the 13th century. Hundreds of years ago, churches had their congregations abstain from eggs during Lent, allowing them to be consumed again on Easter. According to History.com, in the 19th century Russian high society started exchanging ornately decorated eggs\u2014even jewel encrusted\u2014on Easter. But how did the Easter Bunny begin delivering eggs on American shores? According to History.com , the theory with the most evidence is that the floppy-eared bearer of candy came over with German immigrants: According to some sources, the Easter bunny first arrived in America in the 1700s with German immigrants who settled in Pennsylvania and transported their tradition of an egg-laying hare called \"Osterhase\" or \"Oschter Haws.\" Their children made nests in which this creature could lay its colored eggs.

They almost made Counter Strike look like Overwatch with their style of play and the messages. Everyone used the catch phrases of their respective characters. A player almost looked like a turret when McCree started to moving around firing shots from an R8 revolver while Bastion stayed glued to one spot scanning the opponents and killing anyone who comes to his range.

What's the one thing that Spencer refuses to do on the weekend? Work at least, in the traditional sense. Jacquelyn Smith shared some interesting insights from Spencer in her article on how successful people spend their weekends: I never go into the office on weekends, Spencer says, but I do check e-mail at night. My weekends are an important time to unplug from the day-to-day and get a chance to think more deeply about my company and my industry. Weekends are a great chance to reflect and be more introspective about bigger issues. A new study from Stanford shows that Rascoff is on to something. The study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and it drops off so much after 55 hours that there's no point in working any more. That's right, people who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours. Those extra hours are wasted. Successful people know the importance of shifting gears on the weekend to relaxing and rejuvenating activities. Like Spencer, they use their weekends to create a better week ahead. This is easier said than", "The Crazy Cooking Hack that Slashes the Calories in Rice by Half. New research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent. Like I said: Seriously cool. The researchers explained that rice contains two kinds of starch\u2014one that is easily digestible, and one that's resistant. Our bodies don't have the enzymes needed to digest the resistant kind, which means it can't break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically gets absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have extra sugar in your bloodstream, that gets turned into fat, which we know is no good. In other words, the scientists wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch, rather than digestible ones, to avoid that extra sugar in the body. This is where the coconut oil comes in. Adding it to the cooking process makes the starch granules resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, and then letting the rice cool", "LAWSUIT: Double amputee roughed up ridiculed by cops. Supporters have set up an account for Leroy Duffie, a double-leg amputee, in the wake of the lawsuit he filed Aug. 22 against the City of Lincoln. In the suit, obtained by The Huffington Post, Duffie, an African-American, accuses Lincoln police officers of manhandling and humiliating him at gunpoint without cause during a Sept. 3, 2011, traffic stop. Disability Rights Nebraska told HuffPost the incident resulted in Duffie, 58, \"desperately\" requiring trauma therapy and treatment for broken teeth that prevent him from eating properly. He also suffered a torn rotator cuff that makes it difficult for him to walk with his cane. \"He can't afford the help,\" his attorney, Bruce Mason of Disability Rights Nebraska, said. (The story continues after the photo.) Credit: La'Terria Duffie According to the suit, Duffie was pulled over for no apparent reason, and police with guns drawn demanded that he exit the van with his hands up. Duffie explained that his two prosthetic legs prevented him from raising his arms and getting out at the same time. Police insisted, and Duffie tumbled out of the captain's seat, losing his legs while smashing his head and shoulder against the pavement. Cops jammed their knees into his back", "Packers Kick Returner Finds Loophole In NFL Rulebook. Green Bay Packers kick returner and WR Ty Montgomery flew under the radar with the most heads up play out of any NFL snap Sunday. On a late 1st quarter kickoff during the Lions-Packers game yesterday, Montgomery received a lions kick that ended up near the 3-yard line. Instead of waiting for it to roll into the end zone for a touchback or have it be downed by the kicking team, Montgomery purposely stepped out of bounds before diving on top of the ball while his feet remained out of bounds. Instead of the Packers beginning their drive at the 3-yard line or even the 25 (have there been a touchback), Green Bay was able to advance the ball to the 40-yard line due to a penalty. Not just any penalty though, it\u2019s one that warrants one of the heftiest yardage punishments of any. That penalty states that via the NFL rulebook, if the ball comes into contact with a player that is out of bounds, the ball is hear-by considered out of bounds. If you think of it like an electric current, Montgomery was the connect that was able to, through him, make the ball technically out of bounds.

Cavemen dentists were notoriously poor record keepers. And while bones can survive the march of time, biological material like chewed food isn't as hearty. That makes it hard to know, say, what a cavewoman ate for dinner on a chilly night in northern Spain, or whether she preferred Colgate or Crest. Karen Hardy may have cracked the mystery, literally, by breaking down calcified plaque from some of the oldest human remains in Europe. \"The dental plaque is a film that covers your teeth and that's why you have to brush your teeth every day,\" she told The Washington Post. \"If not, it hardens and becomes calcified. Within about 10 days, it\u2019s attached onto your tooth as this extremely hard material that you can\u2019t get off unless you go to the dentist.\" If you can't make it to the dentist, you could also have an archaeologist chisel some off your teeth a million years from now. That's what Hardy did with a fossil from the Sima del Elefante archaeological site in Atapuerca, a mountainous region in northern Spain. The site \"contains a rich fossil record of the earliest human beings in Europe,\" according to", "Sergio Aguero Trying To Get Fellow Argentine To Join Manchester City. Sergio Aguero is set to do his best to persuade Argentina striker Paulo Dybala to join Pep Guardiola and Manchester City in the summer. Former Palermo striker Dybala has been a revelation for Juventus this season, notching in 23 goals and helping the Old Lady win Serie A and the Coppa Italia. Champions League winners Real Madrid are said to be interested in the 22-year old but Sergio Aguero is said to be trying to work some magic in getting Dybala to the Etihad. Pep Guardiola wants to overhaul the Manchester City squad and part of that will mean adding a host of talented young players. Dybala is one of the best young players in world football and has already proved he is capable of playing at the very highest level. City talisman Aguero has been trying to get Lionel Messi to the club, but may find it easier to influence Dybala, who would be the perfect partner for Aguero at club and international level. City won't be worried about overpaying for a player like Dybala and will give Guardiola all the necessary funds to rebuild the team. And he may well look to bring in another striker, with Wilfried Bony", "Look who just won a \"Bigot of the Year\" award for his treatment of gay people. The award is reportedly reserved for \"an individual who has gratuitously caused hurt and offense to gay people around the world,\" according to the Daily Mail. Robertson had some stiff competition for the title, managing to beat out notorious homophobe Niall Ferguson; Rev. George Gebauer, who came under fire for refusing to baptize a lesbian couple; Scott Lively, who has single-handily taken credit for inspiring Russia's anti-gay laws, and outspoken anti-gay adoption politician Winston McKenzie. So how did Robertson manage to claw his way to the top of the anti-gay totem pole this year? Let us count the ways: After inspiring hope in LGBT people everywhere by stating that he didn't think identifying as transgender was a sin, Robertson went on to compare transgender people to his castrated horse. In addition, the anti-gay pundit has claimed that LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances will put Christians in jail, and stated that gays are just straight people who have \"forsaken God.\" And who could forget his desire for a \"vomit\" button on Facebook so he could express his feelings surrounding LGBT-related posts? Perhaps most notoriously of all, Robertson made the claim that gays with AIDS wear special rings in order to cut other individuals when", "How many of these do you have on your shelf? Here, then, are seven conservative classics that should be on every American\u2019s bookshelf: 1. Ideas Have Consequences by Richard Weaver Originally published in 1948, Ideas Have Consequences foresaw the corrosive influences of moral and cultural relativism decades before the Left harnessed those forces to undermine Western civilization. One of America\u2019s greatest conservative intellectuals and an esteemed twentieth-century rhetorical scholar, Richard Weaver erected an intellectual fortress around Absolute Truth long before progressives mounted their frontal assault on notions of right versus wrong, good versus evil. 2. The Road to Serfdom by F.A. Hayek In the age of Bernie Sanders, today\u2019s young generation of would-be socialists would do well to read Friedrich Hayek\u2019s 1944 classic broadside against socialism, The Road to Serfdom. A member of the Austrian School of economics and a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, Hayek warned of the totalitarian realities of socialism\u2019s conceits. As he put it elsewhere: \"A claim for equality of material position can be met only by a government with totalitarian powers.\" 3.

Adidas, who has manufactured the Colombian team\u2019s jerseys Adidas, who has manufactured the Colombian team\u2019s jerseys since 2011 , is far from the first organization to make the spelling error. In fact, the misspelling is so common it inspired a group of Colombians to start the social media campaign #ItsColombiaNotColumbia in 2013. Back then, Carlos Pardo, one of the men behind the campaign, explained to The Huffington Post why it\u2019s so important that people spell his country\u2019s name correctly. \"More than it being a bother, it\u2019s the fact that a name is a very important part of someone\u2019s identity,\" Pardo told HuffPost. \"If my name is Carlos and they call me something different repeatedly, I\u2019m going to feel bad. We just want people to call us by our name, but the issue goes beyond the name, we want people to be interested in the positive things that are happening here.\" Several fans have also expressed their indignation over the ad on social media, including the \"It\u2019s Colombia, Not Columbia\" Facebook page.", "Who can stop executive orders? \"The time for empty talk is over,\" he told the crowd assembled at the Capitol. \"Now arrives the hour of action.\" In the days since taking office, Trump, who has long cast himself a doer in a world of talkers, has been furiously issuing what are formally known as executive orders and presidential memorandums. Since Inauguration Day, he issued seven executive orders and 11 presidential memorandums. A number of those actions roll back former President Barack Obama's policies and agenda -- another promise that Trump made during the campaign. On Friday, Jan. 27, Trump signed an executive order -- \"Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States\" -- suspending the refugee program for 120 days and halting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days. The Constitution states that \"executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.\" However, there's nothing in the Constitution or any federal statute that gives the president the power to issue the directives in any particular way, according to professor Aziz Huq, who teaches law at the University of Chicago.

Wojcik and her partner, Jess, are waiting to hear the results of a case that challenges Michigan's gay marriage ban. U.S. District Court Judge Bernard Friedman will hear arguments in Detroit Wednesday and is expected to issue a ruling the same day. \"When I heard that people were trying to challenge that ... I can't quite put into words just how excited I was, and also, nervous,\" said Wojcik, who is 27. \"Nervous because this could be a chance for Michigan to finally move forward ... but also nervous that instead of it being a positive thing, it could also be a reminder of just how much discrimination the community still faces.\" LGBT advocacy groups are prepared for the possibility that Friedman will overturn the ban. They have urged that in that event, couples who want to get married do it quickly before the case is appealed. Several counties have agreed to issue licenses -- including Oakland, where Wojcik plans to go. Wojcik and her partner live in Farmington Hills and had a marriage ceremony last summer. Though they considered going to a state that recognizes same-sex marriages, they decided it was too expensive and more important to have their friends", "Is staring at your phone giving you a humpback? Endless hours put into working and commuting mean the average Londoner spends many a waking hour hovering over a mobile phone or tablet. The result, warn experts, is an epidemic of the rounded shoulders and chronic pain that epitomise \"text neck\", the generational body ailment said to be induced by our addiction to technology. Last month, an Australian chiropractor revealed an alarming increase in the number of teenagers developing abnormally curved spines due to the hours they spend daily with necks bent over their smartphones. It follows several studies that have warned of the damage that can be caused by spending too long in a hunched position, with your head hanging forward. One New York-based expert went so far as to suggest that the undue pressure placed on our necks and upper backs by bad habits is so excessive that it causes wear and tear that could eventually necessitate surgery. In his study, published in the journal Surgical Technology International last year, Dr Kenneth Hansraj, head of spine surgery at New York Spine Surgery & Rehabilitation Medicine, said texting, typing and playing endless hours of Candy Crush Saga puts as much as 27kg worth of pressure on the cervical spine \u2014", "Ex-pope calls famous scientist a \"fiction writer\". Dawkins, an internationally acclaimed evolutionary biologist and author, is well known for his critical treatment of religion. And, it was recently revealed that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI took a jab at one of Dawkins' best known (and hotly debated) books, The Selfish Gene, as part of a letter written to atheist mathematician Piergiorgio Odifreddi. Excerpts of the 11-page letter, which discussed a variety of topics, were reprinted by Italy's La Repubblica newspaper Tuesday with the permission of the former pope, Reuters notes. The message included passages slamming Dawkins' 1976 book on the theory of natural selection as \"science fiction.\" \"There is, moreover, science fiction in a big way just even within the theory of evolution,\" Benedict wrote. \"'The Selfish Gene' by Richard Dawkins is a classic example of science fiction.\" Vatican Insider, Italian newspaper La Stampa's English-language site, notes that Benedict's letter was in response to a book by Odifreddi that was particularly critical of Catholicism, as well as religion in general. Odifreddi had called theology science fiction -- a remark that led Benedict to retort that \"science fiction is present in many sciences,\" according to Vatican Insider. In a blog published by The Telegraph, historian Tim Stanley notes that Benedict's", "These are the worst airports in America.

Boston\u2019s Logan, Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare, and Philadelphia airport rounded out the bottom five. They were ranked on a 1,000 point scale based on responses from more than 36,000 travelers who made a round-trip flight between January and October. This summer, LaGuardia Gateway Partners, a public-private partnership with the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, launched a $4 billion overhaul of the airport aimed at dragging it into the 21st century. The ancient central terminal building will be replaced, with a new structure and its 35 gates moved closer to the adjacent turnpike and located where a now-demolished parking deck once stood. The redesign will give aircraft more space to maneuver, and help relieve LaGuardia\u2019s severe congestion. Yes, New York is still air travel hell. But on the happier side of the equation, passengers again ranked Portland, Ore., Tampa, Las Vegas, and Orlando as the best large airports. Miami came in fifth, displacing Salt Lake City.

The Swiss midfielder attempted more passes, made more tackles and had more touches of the ball than any other player in the win, and also covered the most ground (11.65km). \"I believe he has a good mixture of short and long balls, in midfield it is important for us to sometimes stretch the defenders,\" Wenger said after the match. \"We have a game that is based on shorter passes than other teams so sometimes when you have a player who can kick the longer ball, it gives us a chance to get some oxygen and some space. \"He is a guy who plays naturally behind the ball.

Icenogle, who is a Los Angeles-based music producer and composer, shared the same sweet photo on his Twitter. RumorFix confirmed Hayes was engaged last month, after the 44-year-old actor was spotted on \"The Talk\" wearing a band on his left ring finger. \"Sean Hayes and Scott Icenogle have been together for eight years,\" a rep for the star told the website. \"They are not yet married but they have been engaged for quite some time.\" Hayes publicly came out as gay four years ago, more than a decade after landing the role of gay character Jack McFarland on the hit comedy \"Will & Grace\" in 1998. Last year, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, he said he owed the gay community an apology for waiting so long. \"I was so young,\" he said. \"It made me go back in the closet [with the media] because I was so overwhelmed at 26 or 27.

Though there don't appear to have been any recent developments on this issue, the Internet \u2013 largely led by English tabloids \u2013 has decided that it's time to remind us all about a 2010 study by scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital, which found evidence that drinking too much soda can reduce a man\u2019s sperm count by as much as thirty percent. Exactly why this has suddenly become so widely talked about is a bit of a mystery, since as far as we are aware there is no new research to speak of. However, the findings of the study are worth bearing in mind if you happen to be a lover of the self-appointed \"Real Thing\" (and a man). After examining the potency of 2,500 men, the researchers discovered that those who identified as cola addicts had an average sperm count of 35 million per liter. Though this is not actually considered to be below the healthy limit, it is pretty far short of the 56 million sperm per liter that non-soda addicts were found to have swimming around their testes. How these popular drinks produce this plunge in sperm numbers is not known, although the researchers have ruled out caffeine as", "Will a six pack make you happy? First, let's briefly talk about how to obtain a six pack. Generally speaking, you have to reach a level of leanness where your midsection is lean enough to show the abdominal muscles underneath. This level varies, but a good rule of thumb is under 10% bodyfat for men and 20% for women. This is much easier said than done and it's akin to saying \"just eat less, move more .\" Depending on where you start from, this bodyfat could be far below your body's \"set point,\" the amount of fat that your body naturally settles on. Dipping too far below your set point, especially through aggressive dieting , is like rollerblading up a slippery hill. You'll have to fight your body's physiology tooth and nail.

The World Trade Center Transit Hub\u2014aka The (other) Oculus\u2014has already gone down in history as the most expensive train station, ever. The grand total was $4 billion, about twice what it was supposed to cost, and more than the skyscraper adjacent to it. But there might be another record-breaking figure associated with this project. I couldn\u2019t believe how much the architect got paid. The Real Deal has a lovely graphic that breaks down the final costs of the WTC Hub. The story explains some of the budgetary increases, mostly due to the many (many) changes the design needed to undergo. Which is understandable, I think, and pretty normal for these big public projects. So some of these figures seem large, but reasonable. $355 million to integrate the subway line? Okay. $32.1 million for a skylight? Fine, I guess. But then you get to the design fees. According to The Real Deal, architect Santiago Calatrava was paid $80 million to design the WTC Hub. The total design fees were $408.5 million. Calatrava\u2019s cut was $80 million. For perspective, $80 million is the adjusted-for-inflation cost to build Grand Central Terminal.

Prince George, who is kicking off his sixth week of preschool at Westacre Montessori in Norfolk, near his family's country home, leaves his title at the classroom door when he hangs up his coat each day. The 2-year-old royal is known simply as \"George\" among his classmates and teachers, a royal source confirms. The name will likely be written on his coat-and-backpack peg, and his teachers will write it for him on his artwork, says Louise Livingston, who is director of training at the Maria Montessori Institute, where many of the teachers at George's school have studied.

One Republican lawmaker walked a group of reporters through how this might happen on Thursday afternoon, and said that he thinks a deal will be reached by the Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling. \"I think we'll avoid default. I think we'll stumble toward a larger deal that will continue to narrow the deficit,\" said the lawmaker. \"I don't think it will be as grand as the grand bargain.\" In short, the GOP member, who spoke on the condition he not be quoted by name in order to speak more frankly, said during an hour talk that members of his party might be willing to vote to end some or all of the sequester, in exchange for changes to Social Security and Medicare. The sequester was the result of the last budget showdown, and it cut discretionary spending across the board. Because neither party is happy with the sequester cuts, they could become another key bargaining chip in a deal to pass a funding bill and end the government shutdown. Republicans could possibly seek the changes to entitlement spending, and in turn vote to restore funding in other areas -- all within negotiations over a deal to reopen the", "Surprise! 19 celebrities you didn't know were twins.

That includes her fraternal twin sister, Patr\u00edcia. \"Thank you for being always there for me, since the very beginning. I love you so much. #birthday #twinsister #bestfriendintheworld #love,\" she wrote on Facebook for their 35th birthday last year.

Michael faced some serious health problems as a child. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and got a heart transplant at the age of 13 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.

On the first pitch he saw, Tebow took a high-and-outside fastball from Kilichowski and basically tomahawked it over the fence in left-center field.

There\u2019s good reason. \"Roughly from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they\u2019re experiencing,\" says Margaret Campbell, a professor of nursing at Wayne State University who has worked in palliative care for decades. The way death is talked about tends to be based on what family, friends, and medical professionals see, rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like. James Hallenbeck, a palliative-care specialist at Stanford University, often compares dying to black holes. \"We can see the effect of black holes, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to look inside them. They exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them. As one passes the \u2018event horizon,\u2019 apparently the laws of physics begin to change.\" What does dying feel like?

She lets it sit for a few minutes on the areas that need a little more coverage. (She saw HuffPost Live lead makeup artist Kari Bauce do this trick.)

The video, posted to YouTube Monday, shows a man lying on the ground as several Long Beach Police officers surround him. One of the officers then strikes the man in the legs as others shout orders. Family members identified the man as Porfirio Santos-Lopez, 46, of Long Beach, and said they were devastated by the incident which took place at Locust Avenue and South Street Monday. He was being taken into surgery at Long Beach Memorial Hospital late Tuesday night for his injuries, said his wife, Lee Ann Hernandez. Long Beach Police would not make a comment on the incident late Tuesday night saying a statement would be made on Wednesday. However, police did speak to KTLA and said the case was under investigation. They also offered nearby store video surveillance that shows Santos-Lopez punching a man prior to the alleged police beating.

One of the best ways to keep your brain sharp as you get older may be to stay busy, according to new research. While scientists have previously recommended engaging in mentally challenging activities, a new study suggests that keeping a packed schedule may offer similar benefits. In a survey of over 300 people participating in the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study, study authors found that among adults over the age of 50, having a busy schedule was associated with better brain processing, improved memory, sharper reasoning and better vocabulary. People in the study ranged from 50 to 89 years old, and the positive effect of busyness on the brain was consistent across age. This, the study authors conclude, suggests that keeping a busy lifestyle is important in middle age as well as old age. It\u2019s possible that staying busy increases people\u2019s ability to learn new things, as they may be exposed to different situations, people, and information on a daily basis, the researchers suggest. But it\u2019s also possible that people with higher cognitive abilities are also more likely to be busier. The study cannot definitively determine that busyness alone causes better brain health.

Scrubbing with a vegetable brush helps, Dr. Stone said, but using a store-bought veggie wash might not: A 2000 study by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station found that rinsing lettuce, strawberries and tomatoes under tap water for 60 seconds worked just as well as using a commercial vegetable wash to significantly reduce pesticide residues. Using a veggie wash might even backfire, Dr. Stone said, because detergent residue could be added to fruits with porous outer layers. The best way to wash is to place the fruit or vegetable in a colander and run water over it, rather than just dunk it in a bowl. \"The force of the running water will drive off residues,\" Dr. Stone said.

Studies show that the unemployment rate for individuals who hold a bachelor\u2019s degree is the lowest it has been since 2008. Additionally, by earning a degree, you\u2019re showing hiring managers that you\u2019re a dedicated, hard-working, educated achiever. Being able to effectively communicate is a necessity within any professional environment. When you possess the ability to communicate, you\u2019re able to connect, correspond, inform and interact with your coworkers on a much higher level.

If you feel that your communication skills could use some improvement, there are ways to quickly enhance them. Just remember to always remain professional when speaking during an interview.

Journey to what is now South Africa, and make your way to a river bank. Then, wait. If you\u2019re lucky, you might see a small, hand-sized creature poking its head out of the mud. It looks like a fat lizard, with bulging flanks and stocky legs. But if you managed to grab it and flip it over, you\u2019d find that its flanks are bulging because its ribs are exceptionally wide, broad, and flat, reinforcing its undersides. It\u2019s almost like the little creature has half a shell. First, the lower ribs became wider and fused with each other to give half a shell\u2014the plastron. Then, the upper ribs followed suit and merged with the spine, creating the carapace. (This means that, contrary to cartoons, you can\u2019t pull a turtle out of its shell.) Eventually, through an intricate bit of evolutionary origami , the ribs started growing over the shoulder blades, rather than sitting below them as in you, me, and most other land-living vertebrates. Once paleontologists knew what one intermediate turtle might look like, they found new ones like Pappochelys .

Same-day delivery will cost $4.99 per store with no minimum price of purchase and no limit on how much you buy. So whether you want $200 worth of groceries or just an enormous box or Corn Flakes, Google is only charging you $4.99. That's significantly cheaper than Amazon's same-day delivery service, which costs $5.99 per order if you have Amazon Prime, a paid service that provides expedited shipping (among other perks). For non-Prime members, it's even more expensive: $9.98 for the first item ordered and $0.99 for each additional one. The upside to using Amazon for now? Its", "Is 29 February a capitalist conspiracy? Age: Four times younger than every other date. Appearance: Hands down the worst day of the year. The worst day? But it\u2019s magical. No, it isn\u2019t. 29 February is a dirty, capitalist day, geared purely towards the needs of the 1%. But it\u2019s the date when women get to propose to men. Oh, big whoop. Listen, women can do what they want when they want. But, hey, well done for reinforcing the patriarchy, 29 February. Great job. What if you\u2019re born on 29 February? Doesn\u2019t that make you special? Only special in the sense that Facebook always messes up your birthday. It has no way of telling whether you celebrate your non-leap-year birthdays on 28 February or 1 March, which means it often gets it wrong. Can we go back a bit? Why is 29 February capitalist? Let me ask you a question. Are you on a salary? Yes. And that salary is based on the assumption that you work full-time over a 365-day year? That\u2019s right. Well, there are 366 days this year.

It worked in the late 1970s, when rising inflation caught lenders flat-footed and delivered windfalls to property owners. It could work again, if fiscal policy reignites inflation. That could happen. President-elect Trump has in mind trillions of dollars of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. In fact, his fiscal policies could do more to build the Trump family's wealth than all the business self-dealing that the press and good-government watchdogs are obsessing over. Unexpected inflation creates winners and losers. Borrowers--you, if you have a fixed-rate home mortgage--take home gains. Lenders--you again, if there are long-term bonds in your retirement account--suffer losses. Big investors bet on rising prices by acquiring debt-financed apartment buildings and commercial real estate. Small investors can do it by owning real estate investment trusts. And what better time to own REITs, says Robert G. Smith, who oversees $12 billion in portfolios at Sage Advisory in Austin, Texas, than when you have one of the most prolific builders as your president. Investor excitement following the election came in a spurt for some sectors. Drugmakers and banks enjoyed a relief rally on the expectation that regulations will be relaxed.

For most of us, the only consequence of shoveling handfuls of Halloween candy into our mouths late at night is a tummy ache. But, for kids with allergies, it could mean a trip to the hospital. Too many parents understand the real fear that comes with Halloween; the risk of their children eating something with peanuts, gluten, or any other diet-restricted food. Seeing their kids miss out on this night of fun can be heartbreaking. That's why FARE decided it was time to make Halloween more inclusive. Thus, they created the Teal Pumpkin Project. The idea is simple. FARE is encouraging more homes to offer non-food Halloween treats for their more sensitive trick-or-treaters. And to let parents know that their home is allergy-safe, FARE is asking those homes to display a teal pumpkin on their porch.", "The One Simple Protest Strategy That Could Change College Sports for Good. Normally, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) would swarm like a bunch of Midwestern starlings following this sort of workplace accident; after all, five of the state of Michigan's 31 workplace fatalities in 2015 were forklift-related. Only this\u2014ahem\u2014is amateur college sports, which means OSHA doesn't have jurisdiction. Nor do workers' compensation laws require the school to pay your medical bills. Oh, and since the National Labor Relations Board last year declined to rule on a case involving the unionization of Northwestern University football players, you don't have a union rep to look out for your interests, either. In short, you have no power, and fewer protections than someone serving popcorn in the stands at Michigan Stadium. You are wholly at the mercy of Michigan's whims. Maybe the school will do right by you. Maybe it won't. According to Michigan, Johnson is healed and healthy .

These drones are launched from a special tube in less than a minute to create a vicious swarm designed to overwhelm an adversary autonomously. What makes the swarm unique is that any hostile aircraft, manned or unmanned, can be brought down by a single missile, but a swarm can take multiple hits and keep going. The drones are self-reconfiguring so that if one drone gets taken out, the others autonomously change their behavior to complete the mission. Several test simulations by the Navy have shown that drone swarms are consistently able to get past ship defenses that are geared towards shooting down single planes. This weakness means it makes sense to attack an enemy ship with a large number of cheap drones rather than one missile costing the same. Ironically, the best counter to drone swarm attacks being studied is a defensive drone swarm that can intercept the offensive ones. The aim is to have thirty or more drones flying together without having to be individually controlled, maintaining separation safely like a flock of birds. They are different from any other drone in that the operator does not control an individual aircraft, but pilots the whole swarm as a single unit.", "Mike Pence BETRAYS Donald Trump And Says THIS! Pence, speaking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday morning, criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s prime-time convention speech in which he labeled Trump a homegrown demogogue \u2014 and then delivered an eyebrow-raising statement. Pence said, \"I don\u2019t think name calling has any place in public life, and I thought that was unfortunate that the president of the United States would use a term like that, let alone laced into a sentence like that.\" The irony was made richer when Trump soon after launched a barrage of attacks at \"Crooked Hillary Clinton\" and \"Little Michael Bloomberg.\" Trump blasted Clinton amid the tweetstorm Friday, boasting how often he was mentioned in her \"very long and very boring speech\" while also accusing her of lying \u2014 \"in her very average scream!\" \u2014 and losing.

Doctors Couldn't Find A Reason, Until She Found It Herself. But Lizzie Denison-Ward, a now 20-year-old girl, had this happen to her for two years. She told the Daily Mail her story. She started gaining weight in November 2013. She couldn\u2019t tell why, since she had always been slender. She went from 126 pounds to 224 pounds in two years. When she went to her doctor to try to find a reason she was gaining weight so rapidly, they told her that it was just her metabolism slowing down, and if she wanted it to come off she should eat less calories. So she did. But even eating 1000 calories per day, nothing changed. Not only that, but she experienced a rash on her face. She decided to do some private research. And when she paid for an MRI scan herself after doctors wouldn\u2019t help her, she found that there was a 4 mm tumor in her brain. The tumor was on her pituitary gland, which was preventing her from losing weight. She had Cushing's disease. If left undetected, it could have killed her. By the time she had the MRI, she had gone up ten dress sizes. Lizzie finally had an answer to what was causing her unhealthy weight gain,", "The babygrow that's making dads angry. A dad has shared a photo of a belittling babygrow that instructs men on how to dress their baby. Welcome to the 21st century, a time when genders have never been more equal - until it comes to stereotypical views on parenting that is. If you\u2019ve shopped for kids clothes any time recently, you\u2019ve probably noticed the kind of slogans this dad is talking about, and men aren\u2019t happy about it.

AirPods really do look beautiful and futuristic, but one of the first questions we had about these wireless headphones was about theft. What happens if someone steals your AirPods? What if you're on the subway and someone snatches one or both out of your ears and runs away? Does Apple have a way of preventing this kind of theft? The short answer, unfortunately, is no. Apple says that if AirPods are lost or stolen, you'll have to buy new ones, just like any other Apple product. There's no anti-theft measures in place to protect your shiny wireless earbuds. That said, if one of your two AirPods is lost or stolen, Apple says you'll be able to buy just one. (Apple didn't say how much it would cost to buy just one.) So there you have it.

California girl Kate Bosworth has taken her style to Topshop, unveiling a winter collection with the fast fashion emporium this week. While Bosworth modeled (and sang!) for Topshop's holiday campaign last year, this is her first full-fledged line for the British brand. The Collection, as Topshop as imaginatively dubbed Bosworth's line, has a higher price point than the high street shop's typical wares; luxe items like leather pants and sheepskin coats ring up for $590 and $995, respectively. Kate kept the palette narrow, designing clothes, shoes and accessories that don't deviate from basic black, white, red and tan. The Collection offers a minimal way to replicate Kate's streamlined chic. As Women's Wear daily quotes Bosworth, the line offers \"luxurious pieces with a strong minimalist approach\" that remained faithful to \"the mix of masculine-feminine balance that exists in my personal aesthetic.\" After seeing Bosworth's line, we've gotta admit that she's poised to be a bona fide competitor to Kate Moss' legendary Topshop collaborations.

In an attempt to highlight America's ongoing battle with consumption and waste, and provide a ethereal take on sustainable design, the firm built \"Head in the Clouds.\" Using 53,780 recycled plastics bottles -- approximately the amount thrown away in just one hour in New York City -- STUDIOKCA created a dreamy, cloud-shaped structure capable of providing shelter for 50 people.

Still, many people, including me, have missed flights because they arrived at the airport at what used to be a reasonable time and found themselves still trapped in line as their flight took off. The immediate reason for the long lines is pretty simple: Americans are flying more than ever, and the TSA hasn't grown quickly enough to keep up. But the current mess is also a direct result of the TSA's last crisis. Last fall, the agency got in trouble for not doing enough to keep weapons and explosives off planes, and stepped up security as a result. The TSA has serious problems with culture and management, including disciplining whistleblowers who called out problems. But it's also stuck between a rock and a hard place, the victim of a political consensus that insists airport security must be perfectly airtight without ever being even the slightest bit inconvenient. Lines are getting longer partly because more people are flying In one sense, the", "This kind of lie is more likely to trip you up. A new study, published in the Journal of Applied Research and Memory Cognition, separates lies into two general categories, and teases apart why one category of lies is so much easier to remember than the other. Researchers at Louisiana State University found that lies generally fall into the false description camp, or the false denial camp. With false descriptions, a person is actually fabricating details and events for the lie. Researchers say this makes the lie easier to remember because it takes more brainpower to create the false details. \"As the constructive process lays down records of our details and descriptions, it also lays down information about the process of construction,\" study researcher Sean Lane, an associate professor at the university, said in a statement. False denials, on the other hand, involve saying something didn't happen when it in fact did. Because this kind of lie doesn't require any extra brainpower to fabricate details, it's harder to remember that you told the lie \"because there's not much cognitively involved in the denial,\" Lane said in the statement. For the study, researchers instructed study participants to look at pictures of objects and then lie about them, either by denying that they saw", "Ever Felt Like You\u2019re Awake But Your Body Is Still Asleep?

It\u2019s filled with wood, metal, leather, plastic pretending to look like leather, and glass. But then there are those bright red seat belt buckle release buttons that look very much like they could have come from the Fisher-Price catalogue. Most other cars have red buttons. Photo: Mercedes Red seatbelt buckles are a requirement, but not in America. European seatbelt regulation, in particular ECE R16, states: \"The buckle release area shall be coloured red. No other part of the buckle shall be of this colour.\" The corresponding U.S. regulation, FMVSS 209, does not specify a required buckle button color, hence why Tesla is able to use interior color-matched buttons, but only on U.S. spec models. Why don\u2019t you see other cars with the elegant black plastic buttons instead of the chintzy red ones? That likely has to do with cost savings, as manufacturers try", "9 incredible photo stories you absolutely can\u2019t miss. 1. \"Never-Before-Seen Photos Behind the Scenes at the Women\u2019s March\" \u2014 Washington Post While the exact long-term impact of the Women\u2019s March in January remains to be seen, the event introduced ideas of what modern-day feminism looks like, in terms of scale, coverage and inclusivity. Kisha Bari\u2019s images feel instantly iconic, and will undoubtedly be added to the catalog of feminist history for being one of the few photographers to cover the making of such a large-scale protest. \u2014Kate Bubacz, senior photo editor, BuzzFeed News 2. \"Honest Photos of Motherhood Challenge What We Think of as Natural\" \u2014 Huffington Post In Leah DeVun\u2019s exploration of motherhood, she focused on apparatuses that aid women in performing the very maternal act of nursing their offspring.

It happened again - you delivered a great presentation or you networked like crazy at a conference and the emails and texts start to roll in. The questions might be variations of the same script, but it inevitably will end with this question: Can I pick your brain for free? There is a lot of good advice on how to handle these requests, but it is still a popular question I get and a situation I struggled with for a long time. Moreover, the research is clear: women do risk negative backlash when they ask for more money. So what do you do when you want to help people, but you are not comfortable with making the money ask? The answer might be to practice anchoring first. Anchoring in negotiation is the first offer made on a deal. In this case, that first offer is your fee or rate in exchange for time with your expertise. When someone asks for your help, consider responding with this advice from Tammy Gordon, President of Verified Strategy: Practice saying, I'd love to. My rate is $____ an hour.

It's believed they'll go under a massive overhaul in order to get the Rossoneri back to challenging for major honours, and they're set to pursue Arsenal target Isco. According to AS, the midfielder is high on their list while it'll ruin Arsene Wenger's chances of signing him.

According to Sports Media Watch, the game earned just a 5.7 overnight rating on ESPN. The previous low was a 6.7, which happened on two separate occasions, once in 2007. The reason behind the low viewership isn\u2019t that Drew Brees and Matt Ryan are boring, or that fans didn\u2019t feel like watching the Saints\u2019 secondary get ripped to shreds yet again. It has to do with the other battle going on at the same time between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

That doesn\u2019t include those who watched at restaurants or bars, or the people who streamed it live online. The debate earned a 46.2 overnight rating, which is unprecedented for a broadcast outside of the Super Bowl.

Michael\u2019s smooth vocals complement the sexy-sounding rhythm to leave the listener completely mesmerised. 3. \"Don\u2019t Let The Sun Go Down on Me\" With Elton John (1985) This powerful version of Elton John\u2019s song \u2013 the second time the pair had performed it after they sang it at the Live Aid concert in 1985 \u2013 was recorded on the 1991 Faith tour, was a No. 1 hit in many countries, and raised funds for the Aids hospice London Lighthouse and the Rainbow Trust children\u2019s charity. 4. \"Last Christmas\" (1986) No offense but \"Last Christmas\" is the best Christmas song out there, don\u2019t @ me.

Black Friday, the annual post-Thanksgiving discount shopping spree, results each year in multiple deaths and injuries of consumers trampled by crowds in stores and shopping malls. In a poignant, viral Huffington Post blog last month, \"If You Shop On Thanksgiving, You're Part Of The Problem,\" writer Matt Walsh cast a harsh light on what the holiday shopping frenzy really says about our culture: That's our entire economic system: buy things. Everybody buy. It doesn't matter what you buy. Just buy. It doesn't matter if you don't have money. Just buy. Our entire civilization now rests on the assumption that, no matter what else happens, we will all continue to buy lots and lots of things. Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy. And then buy a little more. Don't create, or produce, or discover -- just buy. Never save, never invest, never cut back -- just buy. Buy what you don't need with money you don't have... Buy like you breathe, only more frequently. To some extent, most of us participate in consumer culture and value material possessions, and that's perfectly fine.

According to the top beauty gurus in the business, applying your foundation, blusher and concealer incorrectly can add decades to your looks. Here, they share the beauty blunders that are making you appear ten years older - and reveal their top tips for ensuring your makeup works for you. Stop using a heavy coverage foundation: Rupert Kingston, co-founder of Delilah Cosmetics, explains that high coverage foundations can really accentuate fine lines and wrinkles. 'It's better to use a lighter, fresher foundation to make the skin look more natural,' he advises. 'Just use concealer where you need it.' Stay away from pressed powders: Rupert King maintains that they create a heavier, dryer look to the skin. 'Instead, aim for a more dewy, moist look to the skin, it will help to soften those dryers areas where the fine lines can show up. If you still feel too shiny choose a micro fine loose powder and just apply to the centre of the face.'    Avoid nude lipsticks: Rupert believes this hue can make you look sallow and drained and women should choose colours with a fresher coral or peach undertone.

The numbers also show that laws meant to drive away undocumented immigrants, such as Arizona's SB 1070 in 2010, did not lead to a broad decrease in the general undocumented population, despite lawmakers' intentions. The undocumented population declined during the recession, as many people left or decided not to come at all due to the bad economic climate. There were an estimated 12.2 undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, but the number decreased to 11.3 million by 2009, according to Pew. Pew noted that the increase in its estimate doesn't necessarily mean a huge increase in the undocumented population, or that the trends have definitively reversed. \"Although there are indications the number of unauthorized immigrants may be rising, the 2012 population estimate is the midpoint of a wide range of possible values and in a statistical sense is no different from the 2009 estimate,\" the report reads.

The tax, known as the Jaziya, is imposed on all non-Muslims in Isis controlled territories and is calculated according to their estimated net worth. The unnamed mother described how \"foreign\" Isis fighters had arrived at her door and said she had two choices, either \"you are to leave now or you are to pay the Jaziya\".

The subject came up when Abrams was on stage for a \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" press conference held today in Los Angeles. The filmmaker was directly asked if fans can expect to see a post-credits scene or Easter Egg at the end of the sequel, and he quickly dismissed the idea, saying: \"No, there\u2019s not. All the scenes are actually in the movie.\" Those of you who have been following updates and stories about \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" for a while will note that this dispels a rumor that has been going around for the last few months. Back in September it was rumored that the latest saga film would actually be teasing the first \"Star Wars\" story, \"Rogue One.\" This made a degree of sense, given that the Gareth Edwards-directed feature has been filming since this past summer, and will surely have a good amount of footage ready by the time \"Force Awakens\" arrives in theaters. Now it sounds like that post-credits scene definitely isn\u2019t happening \u2013 so instead maybe we can just expect the blockbuster to come with a trailer for the eighth live-action \"Star Wars\" movie during the coming attractions.

Strap on a rectangular black headset, and you can traverse a sunken ship at the bottom of the ocean or climb to the top of a snowcapped mountain. That's the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. As impressive as the technology already is, many believe it's still in its early days. That's because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. (Nintendo's Virtual Boy comes to mind.) But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more. Few have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. TIME sat down with Frank Azor, general manager of the Dell-owned gaming PC manufacturer Alienware, and Nelson Gonzalez, Alienware's cofounder and former CEO, to discuss what they have learned about VR and where they believe it's headed.

We\u2019re good at something! Turns out, according to the second annual TD Bank Love and Money Study, millennials are better at handling their money and talking about it with their partners. The study says that 74% of millennial couples talk about their money weekly, and that those who do report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in their relationships. This is very important, because as many relationship articles will tell you, money and talking about money is one of the highest stressors in relationships, which makes sense.

The county is now estimated at 10,019,365 people as of July 1, according to California Department of Finance data released Thursday. The figure includes all residents, regardless of immigration status. The densely-populated county's growth has inched along in recent years at an under 1-percent clip, particularly slowing during the recession. In past years, the department had even estimated it had already hit 10 million, only to revise the figures later as growth was found to have slowed more than expected.

Austrian paper Kronen Zeitung says he ran into the kitchen where the woman was talking and attempted to stab her in her upper body. Her thick winter coat protected from serious harm, however she fell and injured her ear due the force of the blow. Police arrived at the scene and arrested the migrant. He admitted he had overreacted, although he told police this was due to \"personal problems\". He also stated that he had never seen the woman before the attack.

However, after that the odds of divorce increase by 5 percent a year.\" That\u2019s cool if you\u2019re thinking about popping the question, but how does it align with previous research on the best age to have kids? According to multiple studies summarized in Twentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck? by Robin Marantz Henig and Samantha Henig, it depends on what you mean by \"best.\" Biologically, prime baby time for women is only ideal if they\u2019re looking for a role on MTV\u2019s Teen Mom. Kids born to 26-year-old moms are statistically least likely to have birth defects, but kids born to 32-year-olds have the lowest overall infant mortality. If you want to tie the decision to the mother\u2019s long-term physical well being it gets even more complicated \u2014 the answer depends on if you\u2019re talking about energy levels, ailments and aches, chronic illnesses, or overall health.

Every so often you'll come across a random fact that completely floors you and this particular revelation is mad altogether. Apparently, the brains behind that McDonalds jingle, you know the one, I'm Lovin' It, is none other than rapper Pusha T. Former record company exec Steve Stoute, who now heads up his own marketing business, recently chatted to New York-based radio station, Hot 97, and revealed the inside information. He said that it was one of the first projects his marketing firm, Translation, looked after. According to Pitchfork, the information came about when Hot 97's Ebro Darden initially referred to the jingle as the work of Pharrell and Justin Timberlake. Stoute wasn't long putting him right and apparently said: \"No you know who did that? Pusha T\". So, JT sang but it was Pusha T who came up with the slogan and the jingle.

The State of Columbia, S.C., announced its endorsement of Clinton on Saturday night, the paper's first for a Democrat in 40 years. \"The Republican nominee for president could have been an intriguing option,\" the State's editorial board wrote. \"Donald Trump\u2019s resume describes a successful businessman with no ties to the political 'establishment.' \" But like so many other editorial boards, the State's determined that Trump's volatile temperament is impossible to ignore. \"Whatever intrigue his business resume generates is overshadowed by his character and personality,\" the paper concluded. \"He is simply unfit for the presidency, or any public office.

For Las Vegas, an NHL team is a hard-won victory for a city that has long desired a professional team of its own. And it comes even after the city has taken the lead to become the new home of the NFL's Raiders franchise. From zero teams to potentially two -- that's quite a coup for Vegas sports fans.

Lenovo-owned Motorola hasn't announced Android 7.0 Nougat update schedule for its devices but the OS roll out is expected to start very soon. Google may provide the firmware source code to the company either this month or next month, which means it may take only a few weeks before the new OS is released.

These possible explanations were the sound of the word, the word's connotation, and the social transmission of the idea that the word is disgusting.

These included words related to bodily function (such as phlegm, puke, and vomit), clusters of words related to sex (such as f*ck, horny, and p*ssy), and words that sounded similar to \"moist\" (such as foist, hoist, and rejoiced). His study found that people who said they were averse to the word \"moist\" often pointed to the sound of the word as the source of their disgust.

Consumption of high-fat-content foods causes reduction of glucose levels in the brain, a new study shows. Three days of a high-fat diet in mice led to a depletion of blood glucose reaching the brain and unbalanced the body. It took more than four weeks for the brain to restore the sugar uptake at a cost to the rest of the body. Glucose is the primary fuel and the main source of energy for the brain. When the brain does not get the fuel, this will affect cognitive skills and memory. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Germany examined the mice\u2019s brains to see how a high-fat diet affects them and how this can lead to diabetes and obesity. Dr Alexander Jais, the study author, said: \"A high-fat diet reduces the uptake of blood glucose into the brain in as little as three days. So the brain is starving, even though the mice are consuming a lot of calories daily. Responsible for this is the protein GLUT-1, which is the most important glucose transporter at the blood-brain barrier.\" Free saturated fatty acids can have a toxic effect on the blood-brain barrier cells and reduce the GLUT-1 transporter.

Here's why: It's insensitive to diminish OCD to the one, slightly obsessive or compulsive behavior you have. It shows a serious lack of understanding of what OCD is and does, and is a subtle yet powerful way of saying \"Oh, we all have that! It's not that big of a deal.\" Because", "The Republican Party Just Gave Trump This DIRE Ultimatum. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told Donald Trump in a phone call last week that if he doesn\u2019t turn his flailing campaign around, the national party may shift its focus from his candidacy to down-ballot races, according to two GOP officials briefed on the exchange. Priebus who is in the unusual position of also being the Trump campaign\u2019s sole source of cash through a joint fundraising committee which raked in $64 million last month alone.

At 6am this morning, the exclusive Time.com story went out, and it could have only leaked from one very specific person, the Chairman of the Republican National Party Reince Priebus. The timing was no accident as data scientist studies show that Trump tweets the most in the early morning hours, and he is personally an Anrdoid user,", "Could You Be A Barista? The word \"barista\" is an Italian word, which literally translates as \"bartender\". According to The Italian Espresso National Institute, a single shot should be a approximately 25ml. A was a flat white, B was a latte, and C was a cappuccino. A \"corretto\", also known as an \"espresso corretto\", contains a small amount of alcohol, usually grappa, sambuca or brandy. The moka pot is a stove-top or electric coffee maker that originates from Italy. Ordering an espresso \"al vetro\" indicates you\u2019d like it in a glass, rather than porcelain. The Chemex method involves pouring hot water over coffee grounds and requires a filter that\u2019s up to three times thicker. This produces coffee that\u2019s smooth with less fatty oils. The word \"frappuccino\" isn\u2019t even an Italian word. It\u2019s a hybrid of the word \"cappuccino\" and \"frappe\", the New England name for milkshake with ice cream. An \"espresso con panna\" literally means \"espresso with cream\". The lighter the bean, the more caffeine it contains.

Despite being stopped by the wall of the terminal, at the time of the crash, the train had already left a vast amount of destruction in its wake. Hoboken Terminal is one of the busiest train stations in the New York City area; New Jersey Transit (NJT) cites it as one of its most used stations with 15,000 people boarding trains there each weekday. It's also a popular stop for the PATH Train, which sees more than 28,000 riders use the Hoboken stop on weekdays. People who frequent Hoboken Terminal are obviously shaken by the incident, but anybody living in the New York Metropolitan area will tell you that even in the wake of tragedy, life must go on. In the wake of the crash on Thursday morning, all New Jersey Transit and PATH trains traveling in and out of Hoboken Terminal were indefinitely suspended. The 7 NJT train lines effected by the crash \u2014 New Jersey Coast Line, Morris and Essex County Lines, Main and Bergen Lines, Montclair-Boonton Line, and Pascack Valley Line \u2014 will have their tickets and passes cross honored by NJT buses and many private carriers while Hoboken Terminal remains closed.

In fact, he seemed on track to win up until his disappointing Super Tuesday on March 1, and even in the days after that I thought he was in fairly good shape -- that is, right up until his support collapsed the weekend after Super Tuesday. Since I have been dead wrong about Rubio, I can't turn around immediately and tell you why he lost. It\u2019s something all of us who study presidential nominations are going to need to study, and it\u2019s going to take some time, especially for those who believe that strong parties made up of formal organizations and informal networks control their presidential nominations. Is this year a fluke? A sign that the system has changed? Frankly, I don\u2019t know right now. But I can run through some reasonable explanations of what happened with Rubio. The party chose a fatally flawed candidate. Some commentators have floated variations of this explanation. One is that Rubio wasn\u2019t appealing to Republican voters. But for most of the contest, Rubio\u2019s favorability scores among Republicans were excellent.

Unfortunately, the tasty treats won't be available in stores until May 2017. In the candy's 75 year history, this flavor combination has never been offered.

With the launch of a new campaign initiative, \"Unnecessary Roughness,\" PETA told supporters that the NFL's funding to research athletic injuries is no game for the laboratory animals involved. In a press release, PETA says the NFL has \"quietly funded horrific and deadly sports-injury experiments on dogs, mice, rats, and other animals at Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California\u2013Los Angeles, the University of Notre Dame, and other schools and private laboratories.\" In February, PETA's Justin Goodman, director of the Laboratory Investigations Department, first contacted NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, citing numerous NFL-sponsored medical studies that PETA claimed used animal testing. Goodman told The Huffington Post that he was \"hoping to open up a dialogue privately\" about NFL funding. Studies cited in PETA's letter included a University of Gothenburg study, which repeatedly concussed mice to imitate brain injuries, as well as a Vanderbilt study that states laboratory dogs were given \"lesions to the knee\" to imitate sports injuries, and researchers subsequently \"sacrificed\" the dogs so scientists could study the results. The NFL never responded to PETA's February letter, Goodman said. PETA decided to renew its efforts in the wake of the NFL's late August lawsuit settlement against some 4,500", "Bill Nye: Is reality just a computer simulation? Here's what science tells us... Not long ago, all we had was pong: two rectangles and a circle. Today we have virtual reality consoles which are edging toward an experience indistinguishable from reality, or at least what we think of as reality. Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX cofounder, was recently asked this question: Is it possible that the world as we know it is just a simulation made by someone else? His response is perhaps startling, saying that the chances of this reality being a \"base\" reality are \"one in billions.\" To make matters even more confusing, humans are increasingly turning to virtual reality devices to escape this \"reality.\" Thorsten Wiedemann, for example, spent forty-eight hours wearing his Oculus Rift device, proving it is possible to live within a virtual reality at least for a short time. When we asked Bill Nye the Science Guy if he thinks we are living in a computer-generated simulation, he turned to some basic scientific principles to justify his answer. Science ultimately demands testable, repeatable hypotheses to proceed, but how do you test whether we are living in a computer simulation or not? There just doesn't seem to be a way. There is every possibility that this is a hyper-real", "Is Adele A Total Diva?? Adele is an extremely successful English songwriter and performer. Her incredible voice and one of a kind storytelling ability helped her win over the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. Thanks to her popularity and tremendous career success, Adele managed to amass a net worth of more than $125 million. If you couldn\u2019t guess, that kind of money can get you pretty much anything, including \u2013 of course \u2013 a pizza from a pizzaria more than 70 miles away. Yup, the 28 year old sent a resort employee on a 140 mile round trip for a slice of \u2018za, and to make matters worse, she didn\u2019t even end up eating it. Before you start judging, let\u2019s back track and hear the full story. Adele is widely known as one of the most down-to-earth entertainers in the industry, but even she is seemingly capable of occasionally acting like a total diva. When the superstar was vacationing at a luxury country estate with her partner and 3-year-old son, she apparently had a craving for some pizza. The resort the couple were staying at had a number of on-call chefs, all of whom are capable of preparing a pizza. In fact, a source told", "Only a French first lady could get away with this.

Up until now, Valerie has eschewed all things glam, skipping red carpets and performing her \"first lady\" fashion show duties in simple ensembles.

Startup and community-run internet service providers have grabbed headlines over the last two years as they've begun rolling out the first 10 gigabit-per-second residential internet connections in the United States. As far as I can tell, though, only one person in the entire country has actually bought one of these connections, which are still incredibly expensive because the technology is so cutting edge. I met with James Busch\u2014a radiologist and the proud owner of what I am almost certain is the first 10 Gbps residential connection in the United States\u2014at a coffee shop in Chattanooga, Tennessee. I told him about my trials and tribulations with Time Warner Cable in New York City, and he tried to drum up some empathy from a distant past in which he used to send medical imaging studies on a T1 line in Boston.

But the question arises, why they need to pay for sex. While they earn well and spend time in good company, paying for sex has increased. We consulted psychiatrists and here are 5 probabilities, why men pay for sex: Lust This has always been the primary reason for men to indulge in lecherous activities. When need of the time and the hormones of the age combine, it's deadly. Not only so, sex is addictive. And men who are addicted to sex tend to splurge just to make sure there is no withdrawal syndrome. Tired of relationships Most of these men have just ended their relationships. They have routinely had sex ever since they were dating. Since sex is addictive, it's not easy to stay out of it. They may have grown tired of relationship and the person involved but not the outcome. So they don't mind paying for it. They have less responsibility The urge to have sex is universal.

Anytime you\u2019re overworking your laptop, you run the risk of overheating it. However, one guy has developed an interesting homemade improvisation to this problem. Akinori Suzuki tweeted an image showing how he managed to ease his MacBook Pro\u2019s overheating troubles by lining up 10 yen coins along the top of the laptop. He explained that the copper coins are able to dissipate the heat. The 10 yen coin is a particularly good coin to use as it is composed of about 95 percent copper. Suzuki argues it work as copper has high thermal conductivity, which allows for a faster transfer of heat away from the computer\u2019s plastic casing. However, many coins that we think are copper actually have very little copper in them nowadays. For Brits, the best bet is a \u00a31 coin \u2013 which is comprised of 70 percent copper. One and 2 pence coins won\u2019t do much, as these have merely copper-plating. In Australia, perhaps where this trick will be most useful, all of their coins have high copper content, especially the 1 cent and 2 cent coins. As for the United States, quarters, nickels and, $1 coins are your best bet.

When her husband tries to make a joke to  lighten the mood, she tells him, Just let me be a scared mom. Given the fascinating way the show covers women's relationships with their partners, other women, work, sexuality and more, it felt surprising and significant that that's the line I kept coming back to, even after the series' conclusion. It's because so often clients are coming to me with their fears. They'll say, I'm scared they'll give the job to someone else if I negotiate, I'm scared if I take on this new project, I'll fail, or I'm scared that if I go after a promotion and don't get it, I won't be happy in my current role. They tell me they're scared about something fairly often, but rarely are they comfortable with feeling that emotion. They often interpret fear as a sign they shouldn't take action. They may be coming to me with the hope that I'll have some magical life hack to override their fear response and make it go away. What was so compelling", "Why Is #McChicken Trending on Twitter?

The polling data site RealClearPolitics (RCP) takes an average of national polls that ask Americans who they would choose in a contest between the two candidates (a scenario that now looks inevitable). On Sunday, RCP updated their numbers to show that Trump is now, on average, 0.2 percentage points ahead of Clinton. That gap might be narrow, but it has still led some (including a senior elections analyst at RCP) to conclude \"it\u2019s probably time to panic\". I\u2019d disagree. For those concerned about the prospect of a Trump victory, it\u2019s been time to panic for a while \u2013 zooming out from a single statistic shows it. Delayed panic? Although this might be the first time that Trump has come out on top in the RCP polling average, he has come very close to doing so on two prior occasions \u2013 in September and December of last year. Since September, Clinton\u2019s lead has fluctuated significantly from being as large as 11 percentage points to as narrow as 0.6.

The Hyperloop is a transportation concept first popularized by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wherein pods are jetted at over 700 mph inside a tube system. Hyperloop One is one of two companies building this futuristic system. The other, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, is working on building a test site in California's Quay Valley. The demonstration was just a small taste before the main event in December, when the company will reveal its technology in full. The propulsion test is a major first step in proving that this technology can be developed quickly and effectively. While the fanfare was certainly meant to excite the masses, the event seemed more like a waving of the flag for regulatory authorities, as if to say: Get ready, we're coming. Approving new transportation technology \u2014 especially one that will eventually ferry humans \u2014 is an arduous task that could serve as more of an impediment to the Hyperloop than building the technology itself. Hyperloop One is moving fast, but are we ready for it? The technology promises to shuttle cargo and people at 700 mph in an electricity-fueled system that has zero emissions.

However, researchers found that while couples who have sex once a week are happier than those who have sex less often, \"having sex more frequently than once a week was not associated with greater well-being.\" The findings held regardless of gender, age, or the length of a relationship. The study found couples who had sex less than once a month and those who knocked boots once a week reported a difference in life satisfaction that was even greater than that reported by couples who earn $15,000 to $25,000 annually and those who earn $50,000 to $75,000, according to a release.

Pfizer said on Monday it proposed a takeover to AstraZeneca in January worth 58.8 billion pounds ($98.9 billion), or nearly 47 pounds per share. It had contacted its British rival again on Saturday, seeking to discuss further a takeover. The chase was welcomed by investors in both companies, as deal-making grips the healthcare industry. AstraZeneca shares were up 11.7 percent at $76.69 in New York on news of the latest offer, which would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals. Pfizer shares were up 3.8 percent at $31.92 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon. AstraZeneca said Pfizer's suggested offer undervalued the company \"very significantly,\"", "\"Jason Sudeikis' Son Had An Adorable Reaction To The Angry Birds Movie\".

The kid has a pretty good ear, as I spent most of the movie thinking about how little Red sounded like I was used to hearing How the rest of the kids will react to The Angry Birds Movie is an open question. The use of a fairly simple mobile game for a feature length motion picture could be something of a stretch. It simultaneously gives the filmmakers a lot of freedom to create something original, while also not giving them very much to build a story around.

Warning: Spoilers ahead for season six of \"Game of Thrones.\" Arya Stark delivered a surprise \u2014 and glorious \u2014 act of revenge during the season six finale of \"Game of Thrones.\" Using the face of a serving girl, presumably from the Hall of Faces, Arya arrived at the Twins and exacted her revenge against the Freys by murdering two of Walder Frey's sons, baking them into a pie, and serving it to him. She revealed herself as a Stark before slitting his throat, but even before she unmasked herself, she slipped up a bit The look of sweet revenge. HBO As Arya delivered the pie to Walder Frey, she referred to him as \"my lord,\" which is how highborn people address each other. If she was a true commoner, she would have said \"m'lord.\" This is a lesson Tywin Lannister tried to teach her back in season two. Arya was posing as a young boy named Arry when, as a captive of Ser Amory, she met Tywin at Harrenhal. He realized right away that she was a female and made her his cupbearer. While she was serving him, she slipped up and called him \"my Lord.\" \"Lowborn girls say m'lord, not", "The worst gift to give this Christmas. Buying a pet as for someone you care about is a wonderful idea over the holidays. It gives them a lifetime of companionship, and it gives a pet the chance to go to a loving home. Unfortunately, the choice to give an animal as a surprise present during the silly season can sometimes be a shotgun decision...and the gift isn\u2019t always so well received. Some people simply do not have the means to keep a pet, the time to train them...or unfortunately they are genuinely not wanted at all. As a result, many people will take their pet to the RSPCA or local animal shelter to surrender it. The RSPCA is annually inundated with unwanted gifted pets from Boxing Day onwards. Numbers at shelters also swell with older animals being dumped as owners are unable to find alternate homes or kennels over the holidays. In recent years, the statistics stand at three pets being abandoned every hour over the Christmas period. The statistics are tragic as often the animals will have to be put down.

His writing turns potentially eye-glazing topics (e.g., price-fixing scandals in the industrial electronics market) into rollicking narratives. He\u2019s also funny. In a piece about the spectacular failure of the Ford Edsel, Brooks describes the doomed car\u2019s elaborate, gilded grille as \"the charwoman trying on the duchess\u2019 necklace.\" Noting the fact that an Edsel was stolen in North Philadelphia three days after the model\u2019s debut, he writes, \"It can reasonably be argued that the crime marked the high-water mark of public acceptance of the Edsel; only a few months later, any but the least fastidious of car thieves might not have bothered.\" Brooks is the direct literary ancestor of Michael Lewis (who has publicly professed his admiration for his forebear).

Begich has been stressing his Alaska credentials in the race and going after a conservative group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers for airing negative ads against the senator.

Saying I'm not fashionable is an understatement. It's not that I don't understand that certain colors or patterns do or don't go together, but I see clothing from a utilitarian point of view. If it fits and doesn't seem objectionable, I'll wear it. If what I'm wearing catches people's eye (in a good way), I consider it to be a bonus. That said, I know a lot of people don't share that opinion, which is why I turned to Trunk Club, a service that combines personal shopping with the mechanics of a subscription box. Here's how it works: Trunk Club pairs you with a personal stylist who asks you a series of questions over e-mail. After you establish your budget, style, sizes, and which pieces you're looking for, your stylist puts together a \"trunk\" full of clothes for you. Before it's shipped, you're shown an itemized list (with photos) of what the stylist has picked out. If you see something you don't like, you can ask them not to ship that piece, and it'll get replaced with another option. The consultation process is very professional and straightforward, which is great since it's not something I'm used to. It's also remarkably quick;", "Why are all the salamanders shrinking? Some of the best habitats in North America for salamanders are showing strain from climate change, becoming warmer and drier as global temperatures and weather patterns shift. This means the salamanders living there, which rely on cool, moist forests, are also experiencing changes. Forced to burn more energy to deal with the changing clime, the salamanders are getting smaller in average size. Research from the University of Maryland, published yesterday in the journal Global Change Biology, shows that the predictions by scientists that some animals will deal with climate chance by getting smaller is panning out among salamanders. The research team \"examined museum specimens caught in the Appalachian Mountains from 1957 to 2007 and wild salamanders measured at the same sites in 2011-2012. The salamanders studied from 1980 onward were, on average, 8% smaller than their counterparts from earlier decades. The changes were most marked in the Southern Appalachians and at low elevations \u2013 settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most,\" reports UMD.

Bracing for a harsh assessment of their Obamacare repeal bill, House GOP leadership and the Trump administration are attacking the accuracy of the congressional agency tasked with reviewing it. Now, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to report, as soon as Monday, that millions of Americans could lose coverage under the Republican bill. And the GOP is likely to continue pushing back against the CBO. Here's the thing: Republicans are right that the CBO misjudged how many people would be insured through the Obamacare exchanges. But the agency was much closer to the mark on Obamacare's overall impact on coverage. This is backed up by reports from several agencies and organizations that have looked at what actually did happen after the sweeping health reform law was enacted in 2010. They all found unprecedented drops in the uninsured rate among non-elderly Americans. (Nearly all senior citizens are covered through Medicare.) The uninsured rate for those under age 65 plummeted to 10.3% in the first nine months of 2016, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's the lowest share since the agency began tracking 45 years ago. In 2010, the rate hit an all-time high of 18.2%", "Do Taxes Really Cause the Rich to Move? Like its economy, America\u2019s tax system is heavy up top\u2014especially at the state level, where payments from the super-rich form a substantial share of revenue. When hedge-fund magnate David Tepper announced he was moving from New Jersey to Florida, the state estimated that it could face millions of dollars in lost taxes, putting New Jersey\u2019s revenue base and budget at risk. Indeed, income tax rates vary considerably across states, from zero in places like Florida to nearly nine percent or more in states like New York. With inequality rising and related political concerns rising faster still, a number of states have imposed millionaire taxes in an effort to close the growing wealth gap, redistribute income, and generate more revenue. But to what extent do the super-rich actually move away from a state to avoid taxes? That\u2019s the key issue addressed in a new study published in the American Sociological Review by Cristobal Young and Charles Varner of Stanford and Ithai Z.

Permanently adopting new habits is hard, but breaking the habits that make you unhappy is much easier. There are numerous bad habits that tend to make us unhappy. Eradicating the following bad habits can improve your happiness in short order: 1. Hanging Around Negative People Complainers and negative people are bad news because they wallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers because they don't want to be seen as callous or rude, but there's a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into their negative emotional spirals. You can avoid getting drawn in only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary. Think of it this way: If a person were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You'd distance yourself, and you should do the same with negative people. A great way to set limits is to ask them how they intend to fix their problems. The complainer will then either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction. You should strive to surround", "Another Kickstarter campaign to bring back a beloved TV show just launched!

The research could be troubling news for Twitter, which has struggled to grow its user base in the face of growing competition from Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others. Researchers at USC used more than one thousand features to identify bot accounts on Twitter, in categories including friends, tweet content and sentiment, and time between tweets. Using that framework, researchers wrote that \"our estimates suggest that between 9 percent and 15 percent of active Twitter accounts are bots.\" Since Twitter currently has 319 million monthly active users, that translates to nearly 48 million bot accounts, using USC's high-end estimate. The report goes on to say that complex bots could have shown up as humans in their model, \"making even the 15 percent figure a conservative estimate.\" At 15 percent, the evaluation is far greater than Twitter's own estimates. In a filing with the SEC last month, Twitter said that up to 8.5 percent of all active accounts contacted Twitter's servers \"...without any discernable additional user-initiated action.\" Since that equates to roughly 20 million more bot accounts than Twitter's own assessment, that could be an issue in light of analyst concerns about user growth.

But there\u2019s a more epic condiment you\u2019ve likely never heard of before, at least not by this particular name name: It\u2019s called fry sauce. Variations on the sauce can be found throughout the world, because everyone loves combining ketchup and mayo. For example, a similar sauce called mayoketchup, long used in Puerto Rico, is made with garlic and sometimes lemon. But ever since Edwards introduced his version, fry sauce has remained a cult favorite in Utah and the surrounding states, loved by many for its smooth and tangy taste.

Noticing the nonprofit industry\u2019s tendency to focus its efforts on targeting females, consulting group Good Scout conducted a study on men\u2019s giving habits. It uncovered that men are most drawn to organizations that support children and that they respond to appeals that vary vastly from those that inspire women to give back. \"As strong as the response from women can be, over-targeting women causes us to fail to include men,\" the Good Scout study noted. \"As an industry we need to ask not if men will engage with causes but how we should work to motivate them.\" The organization surveyed more than 1,500 men across the U.S. of different ethnicities, ages and social status. It found that 52 percent of participants support -- or would support -- charities that help children. That was the most popular cause across all age groups. And while men\u2019s monetary donations have dropped, their volunteering rates have \"skyrocketed\" over the past few years. The group noted that with more effective outreach efforts, nonprofits could get men to willfully open up their wallets.

Recently, Google\u2019s Chromebooks have gotten a solid foothold in schools and with consumers who want affordable notebooks to go online. Still, I\u2019ve never been able to recommend a Chromebook to somebody in the market for a full-fledged laptop. Chromebooks were designed primarily for use while connected to the internet. And, despite notable improvements over the years, Chromebooks are still highly dependent on a strong internet connection. What\u2019s more, the Chrome Web Store is a confusing mess, and any apps you do download only work in the Chrome browser. But I might start changing my tune about Chromebooks after Google\u2019s announcement that it\u2019s bringing Android apps and the Google Play Store to its laptops. That means Google's Chromebooks could now serve as a viable alternative to standard laptops. With Android apps like Microsoft\u2019s Office, you\u2019ll be able to create and edit Word documents, edit photos and listen to music you saved to your Spotify account without constantly needing to be connected to the web.

There\u2019s no question people look silly when they do this, but people look silly when they do many common things. Many people still think Bluetooth earpieces look ridiculous, but they\u2019re still used by many people each day. Phone vs. Tablet Camera Hardware Most tablets have rear cameras, just like you\u2019ll find on smartphones. People aren\u2019t just taking selfies with these things. But how good are these cameras? Let\u2019s compare Apple\u2019s latest iPad Air and iPhone 5s to each other. The rear-facing \"iSight Camera\" captures 5 megapixel photos on the iPad Air, while it captures 8 MP photos on the iPhone 5s. The rear-facing camera on the iPhone 5s also offers additional features designed for capturing better photos. It\u2019s clear that Apple\u2019s top-of-the-line iPhone has a superior rear-facing camera to their top-of-the-line iPad. This isn\u2019t all about Apple devices. The same will be true of most other devices, including Android tablets and smartphones.

If you drive around and playing Pokemon Go, you might get yourself into legal troubles , but nobody will care. But if you use more advanced tactics that include GPS spoofing or using modified versions of the game, then Niantic and Nintendo will take action against cheating. Players who were dealt bans for using GPS spoofing hacks could no longer catch Pokemon, collect PokeStops, or battle/claim a gym, Polygon reports The players discovered that the Pokemon would just run away when hit with a PokeBall, rather than adding itself to their collection. The ban, however, is temporary, lasting for a few hours, which means cheaters can get back to cheating once that\u2019s done. However, this proves that Niantic is paying close attention to those people bending the rules, and is working on appropriate consequences for these actions.

The New York-born rapper, who lives in South Carolina, was arrested when he did not have a valid license, the dispatcher said. The 42-year-old entertainer spent several hours in jail before posting a $1,335 bond on the charges, according to Spartanburg County Detention Center. He was booked at 6:27 p.m. local time. \"He was arrested on minor traffic charges and spent only three hours in jail,\" said Domenick Nati, a spokesman for the rapper. \"This short arrest will not affect any of his upcoming concerts.\" Nati said Simmons still planned to perform on Wednesday.

If you were a supporter of the semi colon tattoo trend, you\u2019re bound to appreciate this new, unexpected form of activism. It was started by Elliot Costello, and it involves men painting one of their fingernails. Curious as to why? Read on... When Costello ventured to Cambodia, he met a young girl named Thea who lived in an underprivileged location. The two spent plenty of time together, bonding over games and painting each others\u2019 nails. Eventually, Thea felt comfortable enough to disclose to Elliot that she was enduring constant sexual abuse Shocked, sickened, and likely a bit heartbroken, Elliot promised the young girl that he would keep one of his nails painted in remembrance of her and her struggle. In addition, he would do whatever he could to raise awareness about her \u2013 and many other children\u2019s \u2013 plight.

Acknowledging that good fortune, however, doesn\u2019t negate some of the internal conflicts\u2014not to mention logistical difficulties\u2014of living at home a year out of college. Most prominently, there\u2019s that often-discussed, in-between feeling of being 23: out of college, but not quite an adult. That contrast is only exacerbated when living at home. No matter how independent I am in my career, I come home to my mom and dad (and younger brother) every day. Whom I love, and frankly, love living with. Which brings me to another problem: I\u2019m comfortable. Very comfortable. Possibly too comfortable. How could I not be comfortable living in the house that I grew up in, sleeping in the room I grew up in, surrounded by the people who raised me? Sometimes it feels like the semi-independence I gained in college has been completely destroyed. It hasn\u2019t, I know.

As I sat in the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N.C., earlier this month, waiting for Donald Trump\u2019s rally to start, my adrenaline began to rush.

For months, I\u2019d been reading and watching coverage of Trump\u2019s rise. His rallies had become spaces where people felt comfortable being openly racist and hateful, because he allowed them to. And with his ugly rhetoric about Muslims, Mexicans and \"the old days\" before political correctness, he has encouraged it. Not long before the Fayetteville event, a group of black students from Valdosta State University in Georgia had been kicked out of a Trump rally at their school before they had even begun to protest. Later that week, I saw a video from another one of his rallies, in Louisville, where Shiya Nwanguma, an African American woman, was pushed around by a crowd of white men.

The reviews have been scathing for Warcraft , the video-game adaptation from Legendary Entertainment and Universal Pictures that cost a reported $160 million to make. But, Warcraft has already managed to pull in more than $120 million internationally, according to Box Office Mojo, even amid incredibly low expectations for the movie's domestic release on Friday. Warcraft made a respectable $75 million in its first few weeks of a limited international release before opening in China on Wednesday (with midnight screenings starting Tuesday night) to record-setting box-office sales in the country that is expected to surpass the U.S. as the world's largest movie market sometime next year. The movie surged to a $46 million Chinese opening on Wednesday, setting a first-day box office record for a non-weekend release in the country while also breaking a record set last year by Furious 7 for its opening day sales in IMAX theaters, with $5.3 million, Deadline reports . Those blockbuster numbers come despite the fact that critics have lambasted the movie, with various reviews describing it as anywhere from \"rather tacky\" to \"unwatchable\" , to the tune of just a 23% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes .

The year before, she had flu-like symptoms for a week after getting the shot. \"I also worried if everyone at work knew I got a flu shot, it'll be harder to take sick days if I do get the flu,\" says Walsh, 38. Ultimately, however, Walsh got jabbed, and experts agree it was the right call. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center found that getting a flu shot reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 71.4 percent for all adults and 76.8 percent for those over age 50 during the 2011-2012 flu season. The CDC estimates deaths associated with the flu number between 3,000 and 49,000 people each year. One reason people don't get vaccinated is cost. Flu shots aren't always free. Most insurance does cover vaccinations administered at a doctor's office. But walk into your local CVS or Walgreen and you'll likely pay at least $35.

Luckily,", "Why is no one is catching 'em all with Pok\u00e9mon Go in Japan? The reason: Japan simply doesn't have the server capacity to support the game properly. For anyone playing elsewhere, servers have already been a serious issue for Poke\u0301mon Go. The sheer hysteria the game has produced over the last few weeks has proved the current global server setup simply isn't strong enough, especially with so many of us downloading the 'unofficial' APK for weeks prior to official release in a given region. This server-breaking response to the game has clearly worried publisher Nintendo as its held off releasing the game on its home soil. Smartphone games aren't anything new to Japanese gamers - the likes of Legion of Heroes, HungryMaster and Monster Hunter Explore have proved players in the East love mobile gaming. However, Nintendo and California-based developer Niantic Labs know the Japanese servers will need to be bolstered considerably if they want anything close to a smooth in the homeland of Poke\u0301mon. \"At present, the server capacity in Japan is not powerful enough,\" Niantic's John Hanke told Forbes in a recent interview. \"We are working hard with our partners in Japan to enable the servers to keep up with demand once the game goes online there.\"", "I asked 5 fascism experts whether Donald Trump is a fascist. Here's what they said. It's becoming a common question, with figures like neoconservative columnist Robert Kagan lobbing the accusation, declaring, \"This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes (although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac 'tapping into' popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party \u2014 out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear \u2014 falling into line behind him.\" Kagan is wrong. Donald Trump is not a fascist. \"Fascism\" has been an all-purpose insult for many years now, but it has a real definition, and according to scholars of historical fascism, Trump doesn't qualify. Rather, he's a right-wing populist, or perhaps an \"apartheid liberal\" in the words of Roger Griffin, author of The Nature of Fascism. He doesn't want to overthrow the existing democratic system. He doesn't want to scrap the Constitution. He doesn't romanticize violence itself as a vital cleansing agent of society. He's simply a racist who wants to keep the current system but deny its benefits to groups he's interested in oppressing. Griffin, who is a professor of history and political theory at Oxford Brookes University,", "The magic word this researcher says can get people to agree with you. A new national poll about how American voters perceive Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton asked: Who between the presidential front-runners has higher moral standards? Clinton leads Trump in this ambiguous category, 47 percent to 36 percent, according to the results. The survey, released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University, didn't elaborate on what \"moral\" encompasses. That could help the Democratic candidate by making her policy positions appear stronger. According to new research, a perception of morality strengthens an argument, giving it more sway than opinions based on tradition or practicality. In the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Ohio State University doctoral student Andrew Luttrell and his team hypothesized that the people or causes we most admire share a common trait: They're connected to our sense of morality, a psychological shield against outside attacks. As in: Oh, you disagree with me? Well, I won\u2019t be swayed because I\u2019m standing up for what\u2019s right. The researchers wanted to see if a person\u2019s opinion grew stronger or was more likely to withstand challenges if their viewpoint was declared to be \"moral.\" So, they set up a series of experiments with three groups of roughly 100 participants.

Various organizations and independent researchers have looked at the physical, mental, emotional, and social effects of working beyond the standard 40 hours a week. Notable findings include the following: Working more than 10 hours a day is associated with a 60 percent jump in risk of cardiovascular issues. 10 percent of those working 50 to 60 hours report relationship problems; the rate increases to 30 percent for those working more than 60 hours. Working more than 40 hours a week is associated with increased alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as unhealthy weight gain in men and depression in women. Little productive work occurs after 50 hours per week. In companies with normal overtime, only 23 percent had absentee rates above 9 percent. In companies with high overtime, 54 percent had absentee rates above 9 percent. Individuals working 11 hours or more of overtime have an increased depression risk. Injury rates increase as work hours increase. Those who work 60 hours per week have a 23 percent higher injury hazard rate. In companies with an 8.7 percent overtime rate, researchers found no fatigue-related problems. When the overtime rate was 12.4 percent, however, fatigue-related problems were minor.

But New York restaurant, Serendipity 3's Golden Opulence Sundae is arguable as famous its clientele. The extravagant ice cream, listed as the Guinness Book of World Records' most expensive dessert, costs a staggering $1000 and is covered in 23-carat gold leaf. So special is this sundae that customers eager to sample its delights must ring in their orders two days in advance to allow time for the rare ingredients to be flown in from around the world. According to Barcroft Media, around 50 people a year stop by to sample the unique flavour of the Opulence Sundae, often to mark special occasions such as anniversaries, graduation celebrations and sweet sixteen birthdays. Made from the finest Tahitian Vanilla ice cream infused with Madagascar Vanilla to intensify the flavour, the decadent dessert is then wrapped in edible gold leaf. Drizzled with the world's most expensive chocolate, Amedei Porcelana, and topped with chunks of rarest Venezuelan Chuao chocolate, it is no wonder that Executive Chef Joe Calderone calls it 'iconic'.

According to a study published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry , nail-biting might just be indicative of... perfectionism?? Dr. Kieron O\u2019Connor, author of the study, said \"We believe that individuals with these repetitive behaviors may be perfectionistic, meaning that they are unable to relax and to perform tasks at a normal pace. They are therefore prone to frustration, impatience, and dissatisfaction when they do not reach their goals.\" Basically, nail-biters aren't trying to alleviate their nerves - they're doing it out of frustration. The Study Researchers studied 48 participants, half of whom had repetitive behaviors like nail-biting. The participants filled out surveys designed to test their organizational behavior and emotional regulation. The nail-biters were identified as being organizational perfectionists, a personality type marked by a tendency to make detailed plans and overwork themselves, and they often become frustrated by a lack of activity. Nail-biting and other repetitive behaviors are just their way of releasing their pent-up energy. Impact Of The Study Nail-biting might seem relatively harmless, but it can cause some long-term damage. WebMD says that nail-biting can lead to infection, weak teeth, and deformed nails.

According to a poll by photo website Posterista, pictures of newborns appear online within an hour of birth. Of the parents surveyed, the average time it took to share their newborns' first photo on a social media site was 57.9 minutes. They surveyed 2,367 parents of kids 5 and under. Seventy-seven percent of baby photos appear on the parents\u2019 Facebook page, with Instagram trailing behind at 48 percent. And the numbers of baby photos being shared are rising. Since the birth of the Royal Baby, 74 percent of parents admitted that the little prince encouraged them to post online even more. Celebrity parents like Jimmy Fallon have joined in on the social media fun. Promptly after the birth of his daughter, Winnie Rose, he posted a GIF of her on Instagram. While some may not appreciate over-posting from parents, the survey found that only 22% of parents have bragging in mind when they post. A majority of parents polled just want to keep their friends and family well informed. Some reported using social media simply as memory storage.

A video posted to the Cines Argentinos YouTube page shows Snyder being interviewed, and asked about the scene -- which purportedly takes place during Superman's attack on the World Engine over the Indian Ocean. \"Fan theory. It doesn't exist; it's just looks like that,\" Snyder said, then added, \"If it looks like that, that's the gods, not me.\" When Superman is about to destroy the World Engine, in a scene that's a pretty clear homage to the old Fleischer cartoons, there's what appears to be a distortion to his face. Many fans thought Cavill's face was briefly, digitally replaced by Reeve's in an homage to the actor who defined Superman for a generation of moviegoers. Our inclination was to say that wasn't the case, but there's no solid evidence one way or another. Watching closely and in high-def, it seems as though Cavill's face just looks more like Reeve's when he's in that sequence, with special effects and probably high-powered fans blowing on his face. What seemed in the theater like a half-second is actually a longer period of time during which there's not one particular shot where he looks more like Reeve than others to us, so it seems unlikely", "This Is The Most ''Feel-Good'' Song Ever, According To Science. There\u2019s no denying the relationship between music and emotions. Certain songs just seem to strike a chord in your heart (pun intended). Some make you melancholy while others can make you feel really good. The reason why is a bit fuzzy. However, that hasn\u2019t stopped one scientist in the United Kingdom from trying. Cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Jacob Jenji used science to determine what exactly was the most \"feel-good song,\" according to the Huffington Post. He concluded that the most feel-good song ever is... Queen\u2019s infectious \u201970s anthem \"Don\u2019t Stop Me Now.\" The song wasn\u2019t a huge hit when it was released in 1978. It only reached number 86 on the US music charts and viewed as one of Queen\u2019s lesser songs, it was only performed live once. However, it has grown in popularity since then and is now one of the band\u2019s most well-known songs. \"Don\u2019t Stop Me Now\" was the most common response when British electronics manufacturer Alba surveyed 2,000 adults in the U.K. about their favorite feel-good songs.

Totals (1 possible point for each) -- Sean Coyle Goldberg defeated Kevin Owens after a distraction from Chris Jericho, becoming the second-oldest WWE world champion in the company's history at age 50. This victory also sets the stage for Goldberg's scheduled match for WrestleMania 33 against Brock Lesnar to be the prohibitive favorite to occupy the traditional main event slot at the biggest show of the year. With less than a minute left in the traditional broadcast window, there was very little hope that the match for the WWE Universal Championship match at Fastlane -- which started at 10:59 -- would amount to anything but spear, jackhammer, 1-2-3. As WWE stretched the broadcast beyond that traditional window, however, with Owens sliding out of the ring to", "Taste test: Which light beer blew away all the others?

If you aren't sure what you want to do, taking a detour on the highway that is your career is tempting. But without forethought and intention, that detour can be costly, painful or both. If you're still trying to figure out what your golden career path is, you can start by asking yourself these nine questions. In the meantime, here are five missteps to avoid. 1. Taking An Interim Job Doing Anything Taking a job, any at a, may serve a short-term need; it'll give you something to do all day and help you pay the bills.

The stadium show at Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park saw Sia play for just 65 minutes, which is the main complaint in a class-action lawsuit filed in court. As is now customary ta Sia shows, the singer stood at the back of the stage during her performance, with a lampshade-style curtain of hair obscuring her face. The lawsuit says that it led to the show feeling \"lacklustre\". The lawsuit also complains that Sia's vocals and between-song chat was \"impersonal\", as she didn't mention being in Tel Aviv or Israel. The other main thrust of the complaint is that the venue's big screens showed pre-recorded films, rather than the gig, which left fans at the back of the park unable to see. Taking to Twitter earlier today (August 19), Sia wrote: \"This euro tour has been amazing. Thank you all for singing at the top of your lungs and for welcoming me with such open hearts.\" She also wrote, perhaps more pertinently to the lawsuit: \"I put everything I have into my show- it's abstract for sure, but I'm singing my heart out live and every moment is purely intentional.\" Sia's tour promoter, Ilan Elkayam, has already hit back at the lawsuit.

When next we saw Carol, in The One Where Underdog Gets Away, she was not only bigger from being several months pregnant, but she was being played by a totally different actress (Jane Sibbett).

An annual report by global consultancy firm Mercer has declared Hong Kong as the world's most expensive city for expatriates to live in. The survey of 209 cities took into account the cost of scores of items in each destination, including housing, food and entertainment. Mercer found that an unfurnished two-bedroom apartment in a decent neighborhood of Hong Kong rented for over $6,800 a month, compared to roughly $4,600 in London and just $4,000 in Tokyo. A cup of coffee cost nearly $8 in Hong Kong \u2014 twice as much as London ($4.40) and Tokyo ($4.00) respectively. Making up the rest of the world's top five costliest places to live were the Angolan capital Luanda, Switzerland's Zurich and Hong Kong's fellow Asian metropolises Singapore and Tokyo. They were followed by Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which broke into the top 10 for the first time. Shanghai, Geneva, Chad's capital N'Djamena and Beijing completed the upper tier. Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, was also deemed the world's least affordable city in a survey in January.", "A blowout AND straightener in one tool? Say it ain't so... Over the years, I've moved away from pin straight locks and I've come to perfect the \"straight-hair-that-doesn't-look-straightened\" 'do. Unbeknownst to many of my friends and co-workers, I use my straightener at least once or twice a week to achieve the slightly-straight but still slightly-wavy bed head look I love. So when I was presented with a new straightener to try, the Ferrum Professional Styler by Ladies & Gents, I was hesitant, to say the least. After all, I hadn't tried a new hot tool in years. Ladies & Gents Ferrum Professional Styler, $180, Ferrumiron.com What did excite me about the Ferrum Professional Styler was the fact that it was marketed as a straightener that didn't make your hair stick straight, rather it gave you \"healthy, shiny hair with Blow-Out volume.\" It does so with special clamps: While one side is made of the typical ceramic, the other side has a fabric surface. When I first tried the straightener, I immediately loved the adjustable heat setting. It spans from 140 to 450 degrees, which is great for my coarse hair. Though it took a while to heat up, it did get very hot. But it took me a little longer than usual", "This is the safest place for you to sit in a plane. In 2015, researchers at Time went through 35 years of FAA data, attempting to identify where in an aeroplane the safest seats were. They found, after limiting their research to 17 accidents since 1985, that seats in the rear third of the aircraft had a lower fatality rate (32 per cent) than seats in the middle (39 per cent) and front (38 per cent) of the plane. In 2007, Popular Mechanics looked at survival rates for every commercial crash in the US since 1971. This research also found that the rear seats were safest. Survival rates for these seats were 69 per cent compared to 56 per cent over the wing and 49 per cent at the front of the plane. These investigations go against the aircraft manufacturers: A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said: It's an age-old question. There's just no way to say. Meanwhile the Boeing website says: One seat is as safe as the other. They probably don't want to deter people from business class. However, this is all a bit of a fascination, rather than a genuine necessity to investigate - your odds of being killed on a flight are one in 4.7 million.

Scientists don't know how the Morse code-like dunes formed (CNN) Yes, astronomers have discovered dark sand dunes on Mars that resemble Morse code. But no, they don't think little green men are trying to tell us something. The images of the dark dunes were snapped in February by a high-resolution camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. So just what are they? A report from the red planet, or just a weird little topographical anomaly? Definitely the latter, NASA explains. The dunes have formed in a depressed area that's probably an old asteroid impact crater. The circular depression has had a weird effect on both the amount of sand available to form dunes and the way the winds carve up the dunes, NASA said. So instead of the long, flowing lines of dunes we're used to seeing on our planet, the winds on this part of Mars swirled in such a way to create distinct dots and dashes of dunes.", "If You Ever Sleep On Your Right You Need To STOP... Here\u2019s Why! We know that getting a good night\u2019s sleep is essential in maintaining good health. Sleep allows us to wind our bodies down after a hectic, long day. There are many ways to ensure you are getting the best sleep like going to bed at the exact time every night, maintaining the bedroom in a cool temperature setting, and turning off the lights completely. But there is one thing that may be hurting you when you are in dream land and you don't even know. Your sleep position may actually be negatively impacting your overall health and it's relying on one side that is the most damaging. The good news is that you can train your body to move to the correct side. You will be glad you did. People who sleep on the right side of their bodies are causing long term damage. Studies have shown that sleeping on the right side helps the stomach's gastric acid travel to the esophagus. Over time, this increases the risk of developing esophageal and stomach cancer. Switching to your left side will improve your health. The left side of your body is considered the \"dominant weak side.\" Sleeping on the left gives the body", "Here's why your goodbod became a dadbod (and how to reverse it). The dadbod first came into light because some women actually found dadbod it hotter than the ultra-ripped ken doll look.

With dadbods, however, metabolism usually isn\u2019t the issue. We\u2019ve explained before that your resting metabolism (the amount of calories that you burn just living) accounts for 70% of total calories. On top of that, 85% of this number can be explained by fat free mass, or more simply how much muscle you have. Sure, metabolisms do decrease as people age, but only if there is an accompanied loss of muscle a condition known as sarcopenia, in which you lose muscle mass each year after the age of 50.

A new character might be on its way for joining the Overwatch roster soon. Cyber detectives and some Overwatch fans are hopeful about this and are keeping a keen eye on the hints provided by Blizzard on their videos. They are also gathering all the information about the new character available on the web and piecing them together. A story about this was covered in detail by NeoGaf, where they compiled a couple of sources which indicates that the new support character named Sombra can come to Overwatch soon. To start with, they pointed out to a French theater ad which suggested that Sombra will be unveiled for Overwatch soon. Soon after, the theater where the ad was shown later claimed that the tease in the ad was a typo. However NeoGaf user, Nirolak, who compiled the article believes that the theater is lying as Blizzard had already confirmed about working on two new heroes. Pointing at the second clue Nirolak wrote, \"Way back in November, people noticed that there\u2019s a table in Dorado with files for Soldier 76/Jack Morrison and Sombra.

Answer by Matan Shelomi, Organismic and Evolutionary Biologist, on Quora: All life on earth is constantly evolving; the process doesn't stop. As living things, humans are still evolving. Since we became Homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? Actually, yes. Thousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years). Changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in ADHD and blue eyes. Yes, blue eyes. Genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the Black Sea region. For whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist. Another famous example is HgbS (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria. Malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-Saharan Africa). Unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia. We all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if", "People are very worried by this video of Donald Trump. And no, that's not because of his casual disregard for fact, or his utterly incomprehensible incoherence. It's because he could not locate the guy sitting right in front of him. During a briefing in the White House on cybersecurity, Trump introduced the man he's chosen to fight the War on Hacking: former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. But then the above video happened... With that I wanna introduce Rudy Giuliani and he's gonna be working with Jared Kushner and with Tom Bossert who are also here. Rudy's very much of an expert on cyber security: it's been a very important thing to him, and to what he does and maybe I'll ask Rudy to say a few words. He says this sitting across the table from Rudy, directly facing him. Then he looks around desperately to his left and right, saying: Where's Rudy? When the guy on his right (Homeland Security chief General John Kelly) clearly took pity on him and pointed out the obvious, Trump proceeded to swing his big wig back to the left and say:  Oh there's Rudy. However, lucidity didn't seem to return to his eyes (relatively speaking) until a few seconds after Giuliani began", "The Reason Conor McGregor Got Beat By Nate Diaz. In his last octagon outing, Conor McGregor suffered his first UFC lost after succumbing to the American's superior grappling. Following his stunning 13-second victory over Jose Aldo he was set to make history by becoming only the third fighter to win belts in two divisions until lightweight holder Rafael Dos Anjos pulled out, paving the way for a catchweight bout with Nate Diaz. What was behind the devastating loss: Cardio? Energy inefficient? Muscle Mass? None of the above, according to coach John Kavanagh. From his new autobiography Win or Learn via The 42, he identified how the practice of weight cutting, which wasn't involved for his UFC 196 fight, played a huge part in his preparation, saying; \"Not having to cut weight for the fight against Diaz was supposedly helpful, but in hindsight it was undoubtedly a hindrance. Cutting weight may not be much fun, but it does serve as a reminder that you're preparing for a fight. It focuses the mind and has been an enormous part of what we've been doing.

In 2012, voters in California approved a measure to raise taxes on millionaires, bringing their top state income tax rate to 13.3 percent, the highest in the nation. Conservative economists predicted calamity, or at least a big slowdown in growth. Also that year, the governor of Kansas signed a series of changes to the state's tax code, including reducing income and sales tax rates. Conservative economists predicted a boom. Neither of those predictions came true. Not right away -- California grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week. Now, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. But the divergent experiences of California and Kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it. California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. That was up from 3.1 percent growth for the Golden State in 2014, which was near the top", "Guess who is boycotting Target over its support of marriage equality.

[Milky Way's Black Hole Eats Gas Cloud (Images)] Collision coming In 2003, scientists discovered what seemed to be a cloud of gas, termed G2, which should collide in March or thereabouts with the supermassive black hole that lurks at the heart of the Milky Way. The interaction will reveal much about this black hole, which is known as Sagittarius A* (or Sag A* for short). Although scientists have observed signs of such feeding in other galaxies, it's rare to see these events so close to home. With their enormous gravitational pull, the centers of black holes trap even light, making them difficult to see.

They don\u2019t fart\u2014detectably. There\u2019s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone has ever truly observed\u2014or more importantly, measured\u2014a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate? As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don\u2019t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird\u2019s gastrointestinal tract, he\u2019d be concerned something was wrong with the bird. But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there\u2019s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected. In another blog post, she describes the only written account she\u2019s aware of describing a possible bird fart.

Picking up some bad roles In 2008, it seemed liked Ryan was making a comeback with the a movie called The Women. The remake featured a star-studded cast to act alongside Ryan, including popular performers like Debra Messing, Bette Midler, Jada Pinkett Smith, Annette Bening, and Eva Mendes, to name a few. Sadly, The Women received some not-so-favorable reviews. One critic from Time even called it \"...one of the worst movies I've ever seen.\" Ouch! That could've hurt not only her pride, but possibly her film portfolio.

Steven Spielberg promises one big thing for Indiana Jones 5 With the 73-year-old Harrison Ford signed up for Lucasfilm\u2018s Indiana Jones 5, many fans are wondering/worried that director Steven Spielberg plans to have the same fate of Han Solo in The Force Awakens befall our favorite globe-trotting archaeologist. Well worry no longer, as the legendary filmmaker has told The Hollywood Reporter that he is not only \"super excited\" about the fifth installment but that adventure will still have a name at the end of the movie and that name will be Indiana Jones! \"I think this one is straight down the pike for the fans,\" said Spielberg, who would not reveal plot details, with one exception: \"The one thing I will tell you is I\u2019m not killing off Harrison [Ford] at the end of it.\" That\u2019s great news for fans who would likely balk at such an idea, the same way they would be furious if James Bond accidentally slipped in the shower and cracked his skull at the end of a (hypothetical) final 007 movie.

This time around, Euro 2016 featured a total of 24 teams. After lucky wins, heartbreaking losses, thumping defeats and commanding victories, 20 of those teams were eliminated. Leaving only 4. Maybe your favourite team has already been knocked out, maybe it still survives, maybe it is heading towards glory. 5 days from now, the kings of Europe will be crowned.

WYFF 4 reports that the child, who is now 8 years old and identified by the network only as \"M.C.,\" received the surgery after being born with both male and female reproductive organs and identified as intersex. Doctors removed M.C.'s male genitals in April 2006 and he was raised as a girl by his adoptive parents Mark and Pam Crawford, but he now identifies as a boy. \"We don't think that [the doctors who performed the surgery] are evil people,\" Mark Crawford, who adopted M.C. a few months after the surgery, noted. The Crawfords' lawsuit alleges that the decision to turn M.C. into a girl never went before a judge, nor did the doctors involved ever go before an ethical consultation. \"It's not like he turned into a boy -- he's the same exact child as he has always been,\" Pam noted. \"We just think that what they did was ill-considered,\" Mark added. \"It was careless.\" M.C.'s case is particularly unique because it involves a child in foster care, whereas similar gender-altering surgeries have been under the jurisdiction of parents of intersex children, the report pointed out.

The ability to learn is about more than building and strengthening neural connections. For years this has been the focus for learning new things.

His brand of comedy might be puerile, gleefully lowbrow and juvenile, but there\u2019s no denying that in his heyday Adam Sandler made some genuinely hilarious films. They might not be works of art but for a certain section of film fans they were adored and, in the case of Happy Gilmore, still re-watched by this writer \u2013 plus, he also created the single best movie villain of all time, Shooter McGavin! Sandler\u2019s films from his late \u201990s peak are hilarious and part of the wider popularity of lowbrow comedies featuring schlubby man-children behaving terribly that was essentially started by Steve Martin in The Jerk and continued through The Farrelly Brothers right through to the Frat Pack films of the Noughties. Columbia Pictures Many of these films, like Dumb & Dumber, Happy Gilmore, American Pie and Old School, all plough a similar furrow and are considered comedy classics today.

These weren\u2019t natural formations, and they weren\u2019t the work of bears. They were built by people. Recognizing the site\u2019s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn\u2019t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected.

This superfood can also be used to help treat the common cold, the flu, bug bites, fungal infections, and traveller\u2019s diarrhoea. Garlic is great for strengthening your immune system while eliminating toxins, leading many people to consume it after chemotherapy. But while I love cooked garlic, garlic in its raw form is apparently how you\u2019re going to get the best results. This is because heating garlic has been shown to reduce its anticancer properties and inactivate a key enzyme called alliinase. What you\u2019ll want to do to maximise the health benefits of garlic is to crush it up raw, releasing the enzymes that will break down into good organosulfur compounds, and then eat it on an empty stomach. But raw garlic is incredibly pungent, so try this... Take 2-3 garlic cloves, chop up and crush them, and mix it with a tablespoon of honey (also healthy with anti-bacterial properties!).

But no matter how many sit-ups you do or how many cups of peppermint tea you sip in the hope of achieving a taut tum, some of the healthy foods in your fridge could actually be counteracting your efforts.

Onions: They might be a seemingly inoffensive vegetable, but experts say they are packed with a carb called fructan, which is poorly absorbed by the body and, in turn, leads to greater water content in the intestine. This will then cause gas and bloating. Yoghurt: Many people plump for a yoghurt as a healthy mid-afternoon snack, but certain types will give you a bloated tummy thanks to the high sugar content, which ferments in the body and leaves you gassy.

Admittedly bisexual Portlandia star and Sleater-Kinney musician Carrie Brownstein also has her own thread. (By the way, Ms. Brownstein was outed by the Times as well). Earlier this year another thread appeared, one devoted to the alleged relationship between Ms. Brownstein and the Orange Is the New Black stunner Taylor Schilling. Is it fair? No. It's just a gossip site, even though The Star reported the same. Until Ms. Schilling comes out, if she happens to be gay, bisexual or fluid, I do believe she has the right to not talk about her personal life on TV shows or in the media. She owes us nothing. That said, where is all this speculation coming from? There are pictures of the two of them hanging out together all over the world, from photos at a museum event, with Ms. Schilling holding the back", "The Highest-Grossing Actress of All Time Has Been Revealed.

Wolves aren't exactly the house pets that we've always dreamed of. They're thought to be vicious, dangerous, and perhaps better off in the wild. While that may be true for some of them, it is possible to train them as pets -- especially if their lineage isn't 100% wolf. In fact, many dog breeds are directly related to the wolf, making certain wolf-dogs totally awesome companions. But just because it's possible doesn't mean that everyone should attempt to keep them. Take, for example, Spruce and Cochise. Spruce and Cochise had owners who couldn't provide a structured environment for them to thrive in, so they made their way to this wolf sanctuary for a chance at a better life. Spruce is the one with blue eyes and is actually a no content wolf-dog, meaning that she has very little wolf heritage. The grey wolf is Cochise, and he has a bit more wolf heritage than his buddy -- but not so much that he's not a total sweetheart when it comes to humans. As you can see, though, both of these wolf-dogs are incredibly sweet, and just needed the right environment -- one that gives them plenty of space to run and", "The Secret To Defeating Credit Card Debt. \uf073 June 9, 2016 The Secret Here\u2019s what credit card companies don\u2019t want you to know.

The Debt Trap We all know just how easy it is to accumulate credit card debt. Life circumstances intervene, often leaving people no option but credit card debt to stay solvent. Unfortunately, the easy availability of this debt also has a cost. Interest rates of as much as 30%, coupled with economic and life hardships, make it difficult for consumers to pay off their credit cards. Credit card debt is causing suffering among thousands of ordinary Americans. As of September 2014, the average U.S. indebted household owes $15,191 in credit card debt. 2 The Solution", "Michael Bloomberg's next job.

The incident was recorded by several passengers onboard the internal flight and, as a result, the debacle has sparked a social media backlash which left many wondering: How could this have happened? Airlines overbooking flights is a relatively standard practice and passengers, whether they realize this or not, agree to the policy when purchasing flight tickets. Carriers vary in their processes though generally, an airline will overbook in order to offset the perceived likelihood of no-shows. Federal rules dictate a carrier must first check whether anyone is willing to voluntarily give up their seat before then bumping flyers involuntarily if nobody comes forward. United CEO Oscar Munoz claimed the airline company \"followed established procedures\" when aviation police removed a \"disruptive and belligerent\" passenger from the plane. The airline, owned by United Continental Holdings (NYSE: UAL), said in a statement that the flight had been overbooked. \"Overbooking is a necessity for airlines due to different levels of no show passengers experienced on different routes.

In January, Pillemer followed up with 30 Lessons for Loving, which features lessons from over 700 older Americans with 25,000 collective years of marriage experience. One couple he profiles was married for 76 years. Another interviewee describes divorcing her husband, then remarrying him 64 years later.

One message was expressed in different forms but repeated again and again, with great emphasis: In an interview with The Huffington Post, Pillemer expressed surprise at how many elders said that their greatest regret was not traveling enough.

Obamacare's health insurance exchanges, the online marketplaces in every state for the uninsured and people who don't get health benefits at work, are scheduled to open for business on Tuesday. The Obama administration, many states and partners in the private sector have been promoting the exchanges for months to little measurable effect, the survey conducted by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation shows. The health care reform law is projected to reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 14 million next year, and millions more over the coming decade. But those numbers won't budge unless millions of consumers use the exchanges to shop for coverage and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance or Medicaid benefits. These latest poll findings, which are consistent with surveys taken since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, show how much work is left to be done by the White House and others who want the largest expansion of health care in decades to succeed.

The 29-year-old redhead had the pleasure of acting as Ygritte alongside her scraggly-haired beau \u2013 who has captured the hearts of many a teenage fangirl \u2013 during her stint in hit television series, Game Of Thrones. Whilst the majority of human kind would be more than happy to spend every living hour with Harington, she's decided she has better things to do. As much as she loves her boyfriend, Leslie wants to achieve her own success away from the gossip-mongers who feed off her high-profile relationship, which means working on individual projects and carving out a career on her own accord. Leslie told the Evening Standard: \"I think we leave it at that. We had such a fabulous time working together on Thrones. \"I think it's important to do your own projects that mean a lot to you individually, rather than be associated with someone else. I'm a big believer in doing your own thing,\" she added. It's not as if the lovebirds really had the choice of working together on GoTagain, as both of their on-screen alter egos were killed off.

He knows all of his \"regulars\" by name, and since the 43-year-old waiter doesn\u2019t have any children of his own, he treats any little ones that come into the restaurant like relatives. It\u2019s something customers have come to expect. \"I love the people,\" Thomas told CBS News. \"I just love my life, and I love the way I am.\" Now the internet is falling in love with Thomas, too. A photo of the waiter went viral over the weekend after he was spotted feeding a woman with Huntington disease, a genetic disorder that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain. Her husband sat across the table, eating his usual \u2014 two eggs over easy, a side of sausage and a buttered pancake with a single egg on top. Thomas has come to know the couple, who visit the local IHOP at least once a week, very well. The woman\u2019s husband would alway feed her first, allowing his own food to go cold.

He had this incredible realization that his intuition was his greatest gift,\" Benioff said. \"He needed to look at world from inside out ... His message was to look inside yourself and realize yourself.\" More and more business leaders in the tech world and beyond are following Jobs' lead, tapping into their intuition through meditation, a practice that's been linked to lower stress levels and boosts in cognitive functioning, creativity, productivity and even empathy. Here are eight business leaders who say practicing meditation has improved their work and their lives -- and sometimes led to game-changing innovation. Marc Benioff While working at international computer technology corporation Oracle, Benioff took up meditation to manage work-related stress. He's stuck with the habit ever since. \"I enjoy meditation, which I've been doing for over a decade -- probably to help relieve the stress I was going through when I was working at Oracle,\" Benioff told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2005.

You're more scared of never meeting the love of your life than being homeless, losing your job or finding yourself in the middle of a terrorist attack. It's even stronger for people who are single, a significant 42 percent say it is their biggest fear. Are we more romantic than we thought \u2013 or just lonelier than we'd like to admit? This fear of not finding love is, on some level, driven by isolation. It speaks volumes about self worth. Are we lonely? Every study from the past few years would suggest that we are. Loneliness was, until recently, thought to be a shadow following old people, but despite social media, we're the ones suffering from chronic disconnection. Britain was voted the loneliness capital of Europe, and it's not our ageing population we have to thank. In 2010, the Mental Health Foundation found loneliness is a greater concern among young people. The 18-to-34-year-olds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often, to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over-55s.", "This Is Going to Be the Biggest Halloween Costume of 2016.

An international team of archaeologists has uncovered a 35-meter (115-foot) long tunnel that Jewish prisoners secretly dug with spoons and their bare hands to escape a Nazi massacre site in Lithuania's Ponar forest, a site where 100,000 people had been killed. Researchers from Israel, Lithuania, Canada, and the US used electrical resistivity tomography to avoid disturbing the bodies in the mass graves, an imaging technique commonly used in mineral and oil exploration that shows up changes in electrical properties underground. Their imaging showed that a tunnel started in a pit, used to imprison the captives, and led to an open space in the forest. \"To find a little glimmer of hope within the dark hole of Ponar is very important as humans. The tunnel shows that even when the time was so black, there was yearning for life within that,\" Jon Seligman, an archaeologist with Israel\u2019s antiquities authority who participated in the expedition, told Associated Press. Ponar forest, known today as Paneriai, is found 10 kilometers (6 miles) away from the city center of Vilnius, Lithuania\u2019s capital city.

First came Nutella, then came speculoos biscuit spread. Now coffee spread is here to confuse and delight your palate in the morning. Upmarket department store Selfridges claims it has invented the world\u2019s first coffee spread, which contains a shot of espresso per 9g.  The world-famous store, on London\u2019s Oxford Street, rolled out Coffee Spread on 4 April, to coincide with UK Coffee Week which runs from 10 to 16 of April.  The spread, developed by the brand Flat Brew, contains a mix of Arabica coffee beans, cocoa butter, sugar and cream which gives it a thick, black apperance. It's not surprising, then, that a 20g serving contains 91 calories, according to The Evening Standard.  \"The texture of the spread smooth and similar to peanut butter, and although the alarmingly dark colour takes some getting used to, the taste is deliciously sweet - more like a coffee-infused Nutella than a bitter espresso shot,\" according to an Evening Standard writer who tried the paste.

Although the study had recruited women to speak about consensual sex, all of them explicitly spoke about problematic sexual experiences when asked about faking orgasms. Researchers said they were \"struck\" by the number of women who reported faking orgasms due during unwanted sex. \"While some women spoke about faking orgasm in positive ways, for instance, as a pleasurable experience that heightened their own arousal, many talked about feigning pleasure in the context of unwanted and unpleasurable sexual experiences,\" psychologist Emily Thomas said. \"Within these accounts, we were struck by the degree to which women were connecting the practice of faking orgasm to accounts of unwanted sex.\" Analysis showed women did not use words such as \"rape\" or \"coercion\" when speaking about their experiences, though their descriptions of the events could be categorised as such. Instead, the women were said to have described their sexual experiences as unwanted in more \"indirect\" ways, such as using the term \"bad\" to describe sexual encounters which were both unwanted and unpleasurable. Though faking orgasms is often seen as a joke, the study shows it is a complex phenomenon.

There is no single best credit card for everyone. The best card for a frequent traveler is not the same as the best card for a homebody, and the best airline card for someone living in San Francisco probably won't be the best card for someone in Dallas. Many credit cards beat the competition on one feature or perk, so it all depends on what you're looking for. The best credit card also depends on what you'll use it for. If you're working on paying down credit card debt, I don't recommend that you pursue credit card rewards. You'll be much better off with a card that helps you pay less interest. But if you pay off your cards in full every month, there's no reason not to choose a card based on rewards. Three steps to the best credit card Assuming you're looking to earn rewards from your credit card, how do you find the best one for you? Ask yourself three questions, in this order: Where do you spend your money?  What kind of rewards do you want?  What perks and bonuses are you looking for? Before you scoff at that list as painfully obvious, take a", "How Free DLC Helped Turn A Small Steam Game Into A Hit.

The main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight. Naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled. In Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment.

A \"selfie\" of engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel as he shivered on a rattling train in the 1830s is to go on show.

Chicago's City Council overwhelmingly approved the cigarette tax hike as part of Mayor Rahm Emanuel's 2014 budget on Tuesday. In combination with state and local taxes, the city tax increase pushes the total taxes on cigarettes sold in the city to $7.17 a pack, WGN reports. Chicago's per-pack cigarette tax will be 31 cents higher than New York City\u2019s $6.86 per pack making them the priciest cigarettes tax-wise in the nation. According to Emanuel's budget, the 50-cent tax increase is expected to bring in $7 million for the city, the Tribune reports. Though the tax increase is relatively hefty, it actually marks a rare concession from Mayor Emanuel. The mayor originally proposed at 75-cent increase to the objection of city councilmen concerned it would be met with increased illegal sales of loose cigarettes in their wards. The $3 million shortfall left by the lower tax increase will be filled by increasing the fine for parking in front a fire hydrant from $100 to $150 and tapping other revenue streams at the city's two airports. Ald. Jason Ervin (28th) said regardless of the mayor's decision to budge on the taxes, the high rate is likely to push smokers to purchase packs outside", "School Has Most Ridiculous Reason For Banning Whistle To Signal End Of Playtime. If you're looking for conclusive evidence that the world has finally gone completely bonkers, look no further. Remember when you were kid and you'd spend your lunch playing footy and selling cans of Coke out of your bag before a teacher would eventually blow the whistle and you'd go back in for lesson? Well, one school has banned staff from blowing a whistle to signal the end of playtime because it has been deemed \"too aggressive\". Seriously. via GIPHY Staff at St Monica's Catholic Primary in Milton Keynes have been told to raise a hand in the air to signal to the kids that their break is over. \"It's thought some children may be afraid of the noise,\" teaching assistant Pamela Cunningham told Country Life magazine. \"We now have to raise a hand and hope the children - all 120 of them - see it and stop playing.\" This ban has obviously outraged many, including Professor Alan Smithers - the director of Buckingham University's Centre for Education and Employment Research. \"We have become extraordinarily oversensitive. Does this mean children are not going to be able to play football and hockey because the referees use whistles? What about fire alarms? Sharp noises", "Mother gets cropped out of family photo, has furious response. But because the 18-year-old, from Maryland in the US, didn't manage to get one with just her two brothers, she chose to crop a larger one that included her mother. Big mistake.

Post picture again don't crop me out.\" She added in Urdu, roughly translated to English, \"no manners\", \"ungrateful children\" and \"give birth to them with such difficulty and they just crop you out\". Abeera has explained that her mother wasn't quite as furious as the text message suggested but she did feel bad to have cropped her out. She told BuzzFeed that they spoke on the phone about it shortly afterwards and had a good laugh, adding that she ended up swapping the photo back.", "Are You Reading The Wrong Books? What Science Is Saying About Fiction Readers. For most, the love of books starts in childhood. For others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! But science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. They\u2019ve done experiments, ran MRIs, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? Studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read! What has science concluded? Studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. By engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character\u2019s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you\u2019ve tried on. It\u2019s a fascinating insight into the world of reading. In 2012, Standford University did research into why this is. According to neuroscientist Bob Dougherty, \"The right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions.\" Your brain does amazing things while you\u2019re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. And by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your", "You'll Never Guess What's Forcing Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian's Lamar Odom Divorce \u2013 For The Best In...

Our sources say Khloe sat Lamar down recently and explained she wanted a family, and couldn\u2019t even start the process of looking until she was single again. We\u2019re told Khloe made it clear to Lamar from the time he almost died last year ... she was dropping the divorce because she wanted to help him get better.

This finding suggests that, one day, it may be possible to find samples of what the primordial Earth was like before the giant impact that formed the moon, or to uncover bits of the impacting rock itself. Earth was born about 4.5 billion years ago, and scientists think the moon formed shortly afterward. The leading explanation for the moon's origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds. One of those was the young Earth, and the other was a potentially Mars-size object called Theia. The moon then coalesced from the rubble. [How Earth's Moon Was Made (A Photo Timeline)] \"By understanding the moon, we can tell the story of the early bombardment of Earth,\" study lead author William Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com. However, the precise timeline of this giant impact event is under dispute. The ages of the most ancient lunar samples the Apollo astronauts brought back are still debated, since these samples have typically been battered and heated by subsequent cosmic impacts. \"To understand the formation and evolution of our world as well as those in the", "If you leave your kids alone, it\u2019s not predatory strangers who are a risk. \"You can pretend you\u2019re the Queen of Sheba,\" she says. Playing on her own let her imagination soar. As a child, Ashley Thomas loved to go, by herself, to a meadow about a 10-minute walk from her house in Ojai, California. Ah, the old-time memories of the days when kids could play on their own without someone posting a video online to shame their parents, or calling the police to have mom arrested and the children seized by social services! Only in the past decade or so has \"no child left alone\" become the social and legal norm in the U.S. A doctoral student in cognitive science at the University of California at Irvine, Thomas is the lead author of a recently published study designed to understand what\u2019s going on. After all, under most circumstances, the objective risk to children left by themselves is extremely low. The chances that a stranger will abduct and kill or not return a child, the great fear driving the new norm, is about 0.00007 per cent or one in 1.4 million annually.

And it's perhaps no surprise that many have sideline careers as models, bodybuilders and personal trainers.  Aeroflot hostess Victoria Tzuranova for instance uses her stopovers in locations such as Israel, Thailand and Bali to flaunt her figure on the beach in skimpy swimwear and show off her eye-watering flexibility with a spot of yoga.  When she's not serving drinks and snacks in the air, the fitness fanatic has a second job as a presenter on the Russian Music Box channel. Her Emirates compatriot Georgia Nielsen from Melbourne has built up an impressive 35,000 followers on Instagram thanks to her glamorous travel shots and sexy bikini snaps.

In the traditional view of cancer, mutations strike a cell. These mutations have several causes, including toxins and viruses. However they arise, they drive a cell to multiply uncontrollably until the cancer is wiped out by the immune system or kills its victim. Either way, the cancer stays inside the body where it started. A decade ago, scientists discovered two exceptions. In the 1990s Tasmanian devils in Australia began developing deadly face tumors. But DNA in the tumor cells did not match that of the affected animals, studies showed. Tasmanian facial tumor disease, as it was eventually called, appears to have had its start in a single Tasmanian devil that lived in the 1980s. Transmitted by bites, the cancer spread to other Tasmanian devils and acquired mutations along the way that helped make it even more infectious. A second strain of the cancer was identified last year. Dogs, too, can get a type of contagious cancer called canine transmissible venereal tumor, which jumps from host to host during sex. The tumor usually disappears in a few months, however. Scientists have determined that the cancer originated in dogs 11,000 years ago. For years, Tasmanian devils and dogs were the only species known", "Congressman busted for cocaine voted for drug testing food stamp recipients. \"It\u2019s really interesting it came on the heels of Republicans voting on everyone who had access to food stamps get drug tested,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told BuzzFeed Tuesday. \"It\u2019s like, what?\" The House over the summer approved an amendment by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) that would let states drug test people on food stamps. The amendment passed by voice vote, meaning members' individual yeas and nays were not recorded. Radel later voted in favor of a broader food stamps bill that included Hudson's measure. In support of his drug testing legislation, Hudson cited the many state legislatures around the country that had considered similar requirements for other means-tested programs in recent years. \"This is a clear and obvious problem in our communities as nearly 30 states have introduced legislation to drug test for welfare programs,\" Hudson said. \"We have a moral obligation to equip the states with the tools they need to discourage the use of illegal drugs.\" Most of the state legislation was authored by Republicans. Oftentimes, state Democrats responded by suggesting lawmakers should be subject to tests as well.

At the first commercial break, Stern tells Trump that later in the show, he\u2019s going to ask to look inside Trump\u2019s wallet. Then, a few commercial breaks later, Stern asks for the wallet, but instead of handing that over, Trump reaches into his inside jacket pocket and pulls out a fat stack of unwrapped cash. That\u2019s a weirdly convenient thing to have at the ready when you\u2019re coincidentally trying to demonstrate that your financial situation has bounced back, but what\u2019s even weirder is when Stern fans the cash out for the camera. Take a look: You can\u2019t see all of them, but the five or six bills that are visible enough to make out are all single dollar bills. That means either Donald Trump really did carry around a sheaf of small bills in his jacket pocket instead of his wallet, or someone procured the flash roll during a commercial break for Trump to use as a prop.

The story was immortalised in a best-selling book, Marching Powder, and now the book's protagonist - a former inmate - and author have reunited to return to the prison for a new documentary film. The inmate, Thomas McFadden, says returning to his old cell scared him. \"But I always wanted to go back to Bolivia, and there was always a strong connection between me and Rusty.\" Rusty Young wrote Marching Powder in his twenties, when as a young backpacker from Sydney, Australia, he stayed in the prison, and later helped secure Mr McFadden's release by posing as an international human rights lawyer. It all began when Mr McFadden, a British-Tanzanian, was caught smuggling cocaine in La Paz airport in 1996 and found himself jailed in a place more like a warped small town than a prison. Prisoners were expected to earn a living inside and buy their cells as if they were real estate. There was a primary school for the prisoners' children, who they brought to live with them, and in the most notorious twist of all, there was an in-house cocaine factory. \"I thought what is this place?

They decided to take advice from an old adage: waste not, want not. With that, they started an initiative to Clean the World. Clean the World is an organization that collects used bars of soap from hotels and recycles them into fresh new bars. The little soap leftovers from some 4,000 hotels world-wide are melted down, sanitized, formed into bars and repackaged. Now, instead of wasting away in a landfill, they are saving lives in third world nations. In many poor and struggling nations, people die every day of infections and illnesses that could have been prevented with basic sanitary conditions. The bars from Clean the World are shipped to these nations and distributed to people who need them most. To date, more than 25 million bars have been handed out.

For the most part, no. About 75 percent of U.S. spending on drugs is for products that are manufactured domestically. The expiration dates on medicines mean it pays to be nearer to the end consumer. Being close to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in a tightly regulated industry doesn\u2019t hurt either. Nevertheless, because of the sheer size of the American market -- the biggest in the world by far -- the $86 billion of medicine brought in from the rest of the world in 2015 still makes the U.S. the biggest drug importer on the planet. The value of those imports has almost doubled since 2005. In 2015, the U.S.\u2019s top five sources of pharmaceutical imports by value were Ireland, Germany, the U.K., Switzerland and India.

He had no desire to get back in the game. \"I just didn't,\" Spielberg said, explaining his four-year hiatus after the release of the film. \"I could not.\" In response to a question about whether working on \"Schindler's List\" sent him into a depression, Spielberg initially said yes and then backtracked. \"I've never been depressed,\" he said. \"I was sad and isolated, and as well-received and successful as that movie was, I think it was the trauma of telling the story and forming the Shoah Foundation.\" In the years after the film's release, according to THR, Spielberg spent his time \"sending videographers to interview Holocaust survivors,\" but he began to lose interest in feature films. \"I started to wonder, was 'Schindler's List' going to be the last film I would direct?\" Spielberg recalled. But in 1997, Spielberg said, the prospect of directing a sequel to one of his most commercially successful films \"seized [him] one day like a thunderbolt,\" and he returned to the movie", "Chick-Fil-A just dropped a BOMB on Black Lives Matter...Police officers are pumped!

In case you're not familiar with Sterling, he's the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, a National Basketball Association organization whose roster and coaching staff is almost entirely African American. Oh, he's also the guy who was allegedly recorded telling his girlfriend not to post pictures on her Instagram of African Americans and not to \"bring them to the game.\" As this story unfolds in the media, chances are you're going to hear people refer back to these comments, get quotes from Magic Johnson (who appeared in the Instagram photo), revere the furious Michael Jordan, and hopefully bash Sterling for being a bigoted hypocrite. But before we become engrossed in our own rage and spend the next week crucifying this man, it is important to stop and consider the value in this moment: We have been let into the mentality of true, American racism. Let's learn from him and make the most out of this moment to do battle with the people that share his prejudices.

HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested for years in Houston have turned up 850 hits in the FBI's nationwide database of DNA profiles, marking a major step in the city's $6 million effort to address the backlog, officials announced Monday. Charges have been filed against 29 people, six of whom have been convicted, since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits \u2014 some of which dated back nearly three decades. Testing was completed in the fall, and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare DNA profiles of possible suspects, Mayor Annise Parker said. \"This milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago,\" Parker said at a news conference, where she joined local law enforcement officials to announce the results.

Coachman, who won her gold medal in the high jump at the 1948 summer Olympics in London, died at a hospital near her home in Albany, Georgia, said AC Meadows, owner of the Meadows Funeral Home. \"Alice literally set the bar with her accomplishments at the 1948 Games, but Olympic champion is only part the incredible legacy she leaves behind,\" United States Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said in a written statement.

Image: The Pokemon Company The much anticipated mobile game Poke\u0301mon GO has already released in Australia and New Zealand. The game is definitely a good one to play, but one thing that has troubled the players is its battery consumption. The game has been accused of draining a whole lot of phone battery. The main reason of the game\u2019s enormous battery consumption, according to CyberShack, is its use of GPS and the rear facing camera. Developer Niantic, however, stated in the game\u2019s official page that the battery issue is known to them. They wrote: Heavy battery use Some devices may experience battery drain while playing Poke\u0301mon GOfor prolonged periods of time. We are working on a solution. Some tips to conserve the battery life while using the game is by adjusting screen brightness, reducing in-game actions, and turning off the sound. This has also been mentioned in the Poke\u0301mon Go Database. A battery saver option is also available in the game\u2019s settings, but players say that it doesn\u2019t make a noticeable difference.

According to CarBuzz, SUV sales are skyrocketing as more fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles are introduced to the once struggling marketing. But who\u2019s buying them the most? You\u2019ll NEVER guess... Believe it or not, women are actually purchasing more SUVs than men, according to recent data and research by Michigan-based firm MartizCX. Mainstream small SUV sales to women increased by nearly 34 percent compared to a 22 percent increase in mainstream small SUV sales to men between 2010 and 2015. Within the women purchasing SUVs, 40 percent are single and unmarried. Premium small SUV sales to women soared by 177 percent over the same 5 years. But why? TIME links the increased female-dominant SUV sales to a rise in income and educational attainment and a drop in marriages and child-bearing. MartizCX reveals, There\u2019s a group of single, professional females out there that need vehicles, and you need to be attentive to them. It looks like single, professional females gravitate more toward practical, fuel-efficient SUVs rather than sports coupes and luxury sedans. So far, the top five best-selling SUVs in 2016 are: Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Ford Explorer, and the Nissan Rogue respectively.", "This Hearty Stew Is A One-Pot Lesson In Grenada's History.

This hearty stew is made of local veggies, salted meat and aromatic spices. It's a dish prepared cookout-style at social gatherings, where everyone brings something to put into the pot. Scott Neuman for NPR When describing the cultural history of the Caribbean island of Grenada, it's the cooking pot rather than the melting pot that springs to mind. And there's no better culinary metaphor than \"oil down,\" the peculiarly named national dish of Grenada, a mix of meats and vegetables. Nearly every ingredient in this hearty stew has a unique origin and story to tell: For instance, callaloo, a leafy vegetable somewhat similar in taste to spinach, and the same plant's root, known as dasheen, are indigenous to the Caribbean and were cultivated by Grenada's earliest Amerindian inhabitants.

When fabulous people meet, fabulous things are said. Donald Trump and Son told the world in New York on Tuesday that the Japanese billionaire will create jobs equivalent to three times those at Facebook Inc. (market cap: $339 billion). At $1 million per job, the cash-to-employment ratio sounds reasonable. But SoftBank Group Corp. doesn't have that kind of cash.

The rest is still being rounded up, but expect Foxconn Technology Group to pitch in. (Let me pause here to point out the irony of the president-elect cheering a wave of Saudi money into the U.S.) As for SoftBank, the company doesn't have the money for its own fund.

The victory lap for \"Birdman\" at the Oscars on Sunday night, scooping best picture and director, presumably away from \"Boyhood,\" made sense to people well versed in the Academy\u2019s ways. The organization often is deaf, even resistant, to the inclinations of critics, many of whom crowned \"Boyhood\" the year\u2019s best. Entertainment Weekly\u2019s January cover story anointing the film as \"this year\u2019s Oscar front-runner\" probably didn\u2019t help the film\u2019s cause (or, since we\u2019re on the topic, a not-so-flattering piece in The New York Times the weekend voting opened). \"Birdman\" had so many elements for actors and below-the-line craftspeople to chew on: the ballyhooed long shots, which won the cinematographer an Oscar; the actors having to work with clockwork precision; the storyline itself. Seasoned Oscar watchers said they knew it was over for \"Boyhood\" when \"Whiplash\" took the editing award: the Academy\u2019s respect for how Richard Linklater\u2019s film was sewn together by the editor would have to be paramount in order for the picture to win.

Last year, he took full control of his publishing catalog and made a new deal with his former record company, Warner Brothers, with whom he publicly feuded in the 1990s.

CREDIT: AP PHOTO/GERALD HERBERT There\u2019s a lot to unpack in Donald Trump\u2019s latest campaign finance disclosure. For one, his campaign doesn\u2019t have a lot of cash. For another, some of his individual expenses are pretty sketchy. But perhaps the most fascinating thing about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee\u2019s financial report is how much money his campaign is spending on himself. In the month of May, Trump spent more than $1 million in campaign cash on his own businesses. Put another way, nearly 20 percent of Trump\u2019s campaign spending last month went to benefit Trump-owned companies. Since Trump\u2019s financial disclosure form was released on Monday, a good number of journalists have pointed out Trump\u2019s propensity to spend campaign funds on his own companies.

Although the body has long since decomposed, researchers were able to recover fragmentary skeletal remains and two jet bangles, or bracelets, according to a statement released by Archaeology Warwickshire. \"We will carefully sift through these over the coming weeks to recover as much as possible and determine if there is anything suitable for detailed analysis,\" Archaeology Warwickshire Business Manager Stuart Palmer said in the statement. \"This will include the submission of a sample for a radiocarbon date which we hope will narrow down the possible date range for the burial.\" These tests could include anything from soil micromorphology to inorganic geochemical testing and trace organic chemical analyses, reports the Tamworth Herald, a local newspaper that has been carefully covering the coffin's discovery. But Palmer noted that while there is still much lab work to be done, the team's early investigatory efforts have", "What No One Tells You About Marriage. They told you marriage would change over time, that there would be hard times, but they never said it would be like this. You might be exhausted and lonely, or feeling a little neglected lately. Maybe you had a fight last night and the night before that and the night before that. Maybe you\u2019re feeling a little PMS-y and angry about the dishes that never get put in the dishwasher, and for the love of all things holy, would it be that hard to change the toilet paper roll. Maybe you\u2019re in a little rough patch, snapping at each other about leaving the fridge door open and forgetting to change the burned-out lightbulb in the bathroom. Or maybe you\u2019re dealing with some really fucking brutal shit. Whatever the case, your marriage feels hard and heavy right now . And you find yourself singing Coldplay lyrics on repeat.

Will Smith never really seemed into it Telling BBC News \"I don't want to be the sequel guy,\" Will Smith didn't have a problem shying away from the next I Am Legend chapter while it was in development. Technically, plans called for a prequel\u2014but Smith had already done Bad Boys II and Men in Black II at this point, which makes his statement seem like a diplomatic way of turning down the role. Even with Smith's caginess, the studio, director Francis Lawrence, and writer Akiva Goldsman set about working on a follow-up. Pressed to define his level of involvement, Smith said, \"I'm not actually working on it. If it's great, I'm into it.\" Sounds like the script never achieved that level of greatness, because following Hancock and Seven Pounds, Smith's next project after a four-year hiatus was Men in Black III, which\u2014if we're not mistaken\u2014is a sequel. About that script Presumably, the studio's plans for a prequel over a sequel had a lot to do with the fact that Will Smith's character, Robert Neville, died at the end of the original film, which would make it a tad difficult to pick up the story where it left off. Instead, we were", "How the legal drinking age of 21 actually saves lives. Researchers examined the evidence from studies conducted since 2006, and found that laws that make it illegal for people under age 21 to drink are linked to lower rates of drunk-driving deaths among young people. Researchers also found that current drinking restrictions have not resulted in more binge drinking among teens, as some have suggested. \"Recent research ...has reinforced the position that the current law has served the nation well by reducing alcohol-related traffic crashes and alcohol consumption among youths,\" the researchers wrote in their study published today (Feb. 24) in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. \"The evidence is clear that there would be consequences if we lowered the legal drinking age,\" said study researcher William DeJong of Boston University School of Public Health. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health] U.S. states may differ on the details of their laws regarding possessing alcohol, adult supervision of drinking, or drinking at home, but all 50 states have maintained a minimum drinking age of 21 since at least 1988. The benefits of these laws, however, continue to be debated. Advocates for lowering the minimum legal drinking age argue that the laws have not stopped teenagers from drinking, and in fact", "Is buying organic really worth it? Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic. Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said. Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones. Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food? The answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward. Here, we explore this hotly contested issue. What the heck does organic mean anyway? Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed. \"By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,\" Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of", "New Galaxy Note 6 Leak Uncovers A Disturbing Missing Feature. That's the intriguing prospect raised by SamMobile's look at the user-agent profiles showing up around the web from the next phablet from South Korea. The expectation is that Samsung would be the first commercial vendor to release a device with Android N - the seventh major version of Google's operating system - which would sit nicely with the new technology that is being crammed into the chassis to take on the might of the iPhone. Instead the user agent profile notes the SM-N930A is running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. It's also worth noting that the serial number suggests that this is a flat screened version of this year's note, and not the curved screen version that is reminiscent of the Galaxy S6 Edge and S7 Edge. Given that Samsung has been testing multiple version of the phablet that's not as much of a surprise as expected. At some point Samsung will have to decide which model to go with (or to run a dual model strategy). Asked about the choice of operating system for the Galaxy Note, Samsung declined to comment. Whatever choice is made on the physical hardware, the decision to go with an older version of Android is a curious", "Country singer delivers EPIC slam to Westboro Baptist Church protesters. On Sunday, Sept. 8, Gill stepped outside at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Mo., to face down some Westboro Baptist Church members gathered on the sidewalk. The hate group purportedly decided to protest Gill's concert because he is a divorced man who remarried, Country Music Television noted. The 56-year-old musician was once married to Sweethearts of the Rodeo singer Janis Oliver. After their 1998 divorce, he married Christian singer Amy Grant in 2000. Grant, who has offered support to her gay fanbase, was previously married to Christian musician Gary Chapman.

When you feel an urge to reach out to an ex. When you get overwhelmed with guilt about someone you hurt years ago. It means sharing when someone at the office gets flirtatious with you\u2014even if you don't reciprocate his or her advances. Or telling your partner you find someone\u2014even a movie star\u2014sexy.

Since 2010, Apple's media blitz for its new iPhone has gone like this: On a Friday following the big unveil event, people can begin preordering the new phone, The Verge points out. A few days later, Apple trumpets the high number of new iPhones the public wants. In 2010, more than 600,000 iPhone 4s were preordered in 24 hours. By the time the iPhone 5 was released two years later, that preorder figure was 2 million. By creating the perception of scarcity, Apple's tactic worked to get some consumers off the fence about buying a new iPhone. But this year, Apple was mum about preorder numbers several days after iPhone 5C preorders went live. This didn't go unnoticed by Wall Street. With investors interpreting Apple's silence as weak initial 5C sales, Apple's stock slid to $450 on Monday from Friday's close of $465. But circumstances may be a bit different this year. For one, Apple's top-line phone, the iPhone 5S, can't be preordered. If you want it the first day it's on sale, you have to wait in line -- creating yet another organic marketing tool for Apple.

UPDATE: While no one from Nicholson's camp has provided an official response, E! Online quotes Maria Shriver as saying the news of Nicholson's retirement is false. The original story continues below. If this marks the end of Nicholson's illustrious acting career, that would make the 2010 flop \"How Do You Know\" his last feature film. That romantic comedy reunited Nicholson with director James L. Brooks, with whom Nicholson worked with previously on \"Terms of Endearment,\" \"Broadcast News\" and \"As Good As It Gets.\" Two of Nicholson's three Academy Awards came from those Brooks films: He won Best Supporting Actor at the 1984 Oscars for \"Terms of Endearment\" and Best Actor at the 1998 Oscars for \"As Good As It Gets.\" Nicholson's other Best Actor award came for \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" at the 1976 ceremony. Overall, Nicholson has received 12 Oscar nod in his career thus far, making him the most nominated actor in Hollywood history. His last nomination came for the 2002 film \"About Schmidt.\" Whether the report of Nicholson's retirement is true", "Here's why Facebook tracks internet outages around the world. It is possible, however, for people, companies and governments to turn off certain parts of the internet. There are countrywide blocks in places like Egypt and Gabon during political unrest, and temporary outages in India when the government turns off the internet while students take exams. Facebook (FB, Tech30) tracks these kinds of outages. Both internal monitoring and people on the ground contribute to this effort. Matt Perault, global head of policy at Facebook, started there in January 2011 -- around the time Egypt conducted widespread internet outages to quell protests. Over the next few years, he noticed that internet blocks were still happening with some frequency, just on a smaller scale. \"We felt they weren't getting the attention they deserved,\" Perault said during a panel at the SXSW Interactive festival on Friday. \"So we work with a bunch of organizations to try and bring attention to this issue.\" It's not just about losing access to Facebook. For instance, he referenced a recent Brookings report that found that temporary internet shutdowns cost $2.4 billion in 2015.

Over the past decade, San Diego Comic-Con has continued to reach new heights, becoming the premiere destination for studios looking to sell their latest movies and TV shows. But this year marked an interesting turn where a lot of big Hollywood players simply stayed away. Thursday and Friday were relatively quiet on the movie front, while TV took over Hall H in the biggest way yet. Which left Saturday for true movie fans. And the day was handed over to two competing Comic Book movie studios, which makes sense, since this is Comic-Con, after all. But in terms of 'Winning the Con', who came out on top? We think few will argue that DC was the clear cut winner. And they needed to be. Batman V Superman was first announced at the Con in 2013. It was then promoted at Comic-Con 2014 and 2015, before hitting theaters this spring. After this long three year build-up, it was a disappointment for fans to say the least. So now, DC Comics has the overwhelming task of making it up big time. And they proved they might pull ahead of their underdog status if they can keep their current momentum going.

For the music video, Perry played a teen with prominent braces who throws a party in her parents\u2019 house. \"I think we were on set for like 15 hours and we had to keep jumping and singing \u2018T.G.I.F.\u2019\" Akana said during our chat on AOL Build, adding with a laugh, \"It was just like, \u2018We want to go home.\u2019\" Akana, who got the part because she was friends with Perry\u2019s brother, said she didn\u2019t really interact with the pop star on set.

With popular shooters such as Call of Duty and Overwatch including female characters in their multiplayer formats, it\u2019s become quite the norm to play as a woman with guns blazing. However, the Battlefield franchise has never provided this feature, and Battlefield 1 will be no different. (Note that this is regards to online multiplayer only, because there is a playable female character in the story mode.) What\u2019s really entertaining is the reason behind this decision. Originally, females were going to be integrated as playable multiplayer characters, but then the idea was scrapped due to boys not finding it believable. Former DICE coder, Amanda Coget, took to Twitter in order to discuss how the conversation went down. Even though female soldiers in WWI was not a common thing, it happened. And even though Battlefield is more realistic with its play style in comparison to other shooters, it\u2019s still a video game. There is a ton of room for interpretation when it comes to developing battles and fighting because despite how realistic a game is, it\u2019s still pretty fictional. (I mean come on, respawning multiple times in a match is realistic, but playing as a female soldier isn\u2019t?)

Thankfully, when Anderson Cooper asked Hillary Clinton about her Wall Street ties at tonight\u2019s Democratic town hall, she didn\u2019t try to invoke 9/11 this time. She did, however, mar what would have otherwise been a notably personable performance with one of her worst Goldman Sachs justifications yet. Clinton seemed genuinely flustered by the question\u2014which is odd considering she had to have guessed she\u2019d be fielding the controversy in some form tonight. Her acceptance of $675,000 for three speeches made to the investment firm in 2013 has been a major sticking point for Sanders throughout the debates, and Clinton potentially being beholden to Wall Street one of her biggest criticisms. But when Cooper asked if her speeches constituted an \"error in judgement,\" Clinton responded glibly, \"I made speeches to lots of groups.\" And when he pressed her on the hundreds of thousands of dollars she accepted from the firm, Clinton offered perhaps the worst answer yet: Well, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what they offered. Every Secretary of State I know has done that. \"That\u2019s what they offered.\" An answer that A) doesn\u2019t explain why she thought it prudent to accept that sort of money from Wall Street and B) doesn\u2019t make any", "New timeline yields big surprise abt ancient Egypt. The new finding reveals a robust timeline for the first eight kings and queens of Egypt, including, in order of succession Aha, Djer, Djet, Queen Merneith, Den, Anedjib, Semerkhet and Qa'a. The accession of King Aha to the throne is often thought to define the start of the Egyptian state, with the new study suggesting (with 68 percent probability) that he became king between 3111 B.C. and 3045 B.C. Existing timelines of Egypt's transition from a nomadic community along the Nile River to a permanent state are mainly based on changes in pottery artifacts found at various locations around the country. However, such timelines are flawed due to the subjectivity required to distinguish one pottery style from another, and because styles might vary from site to site without signifying a change in time period. [See Photos of Egypt's Great Terrace of God] To create a more reliable timeline, archaeologists based at the University of Oxford have developed the most comprehensive chronological analyses of Early Egypt artifacts yet based on a computer model of existing and newly measured radiocarbon dates. The analyses suggest the rise to statehood occurred between 200 and 300 years faster than previously thought, beginning between 3800 B.C. and", "The 'Batman v Superman' Easter Egg Almost Everybody Missed. By Jessica Derschowitz , Entertainment Weekly The film\u2019s set photographer, Clay Enos, confirmed a new Easter egg that explains why (spoiler alert) Batman was able to weaken Superman during their titular battle by firing kryptonite gas at the Man of Steel. Couldn\u2019t Superman have used his X-ray vision to see what was in the Dark Knight\u2019s canisters? Well, as pointed out by an eagle-eyed viewer (via Screen Rant ), the canisters Bruce Wayne/Batman used have \"Pb\" \u2014 the abbreviation for lead in the Periodic Table of Elements \u2014 etched on them. Lead, as Superman fans know, can block the superhero\u2019s X-ray vision. When asked by another fan if that was intentional on director Zack Snyder\u2019s part, Enos affirmed that it was. \"Nothing happens by accident in Zack\u2019s movies,\" he tweeted The next film to arrive in the DC movie universe will be the Gal Gadot-starring Wonder Woman, in theaters June 2. After that, Batman and Superman will be back with the rest of their heroic counterparts for Justice League, which arrives Nov. 17.", "By scrapping your antiquated headphones, Apple is doing something extraordinary for music. May it rest in peace. As much as users are griping (already) about the disappearance of the 3.5mm jack, which is widely used across many digital devices including Apple\u2019s own laptops, the new options for listening to audio on iPhones\u2014either headphones that plug into the iPhone 7\u2019s Lightning port or wireless ear pieces\u2014potentially offer vast improvements in sound quality. \ue622 Apple Here\u2019s why. In oversimplified terms, Apple designed its custom Lightning port to shift more power over to headphones, so the new iPhones are inviting smoother data transference as well as the opportunity for headphone makers to introduce new, innovative features. Tech Radar explains it this way: With Lightning or Bluetooth, the audio signal is transferred to our headphones digitally\u2014meaning that the signal isn\u2019t degraded like it is with a traditional 3.5mm jack. Instead, the audio signals are decoded by the digital-analogue converter (DAC) in our headphones, pulling the bits apart and making them into the smooth analogue sound we know. Simply put, Lightning cables are capable of transferring much more data [than Bluetooth or the 3.mm jack] which means higher fidelity audio in your ears. So, Lightning-connecting headphones and wireless headphones both have the capacity to offer superior quality over", "The easy way men can use their voices to end violence against women. While addressing the crowd on Sunday at the Mashable Social Good Summit, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the head of UN Women, urged advocates to use the power of social media to expand the conversation around protecting and empowering women. \"I would like all those men and boys...to stand up against violence against women [by] \"tweeting about it, hosting conversations, fighting against those sites that abuse women,\" Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the former deputy president of South Africa, said. According to Mlambo-Ngcuka, technology provides \"open-access education,\" which will give women more of an opportunity to become informed about how to protect themselves and find necessary resources. According to a 2003 UNIFEM report, one in three women will be raped, beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused. Established three years ago, UN Women has made stopping violence against women and girls a top priority. Mlambo-Ngcuka has impressed the importance of technology and men taking on a more active role in finally putting an end to such devastating figures. \"You need men \u2013- you just cannot crack these issues without winning over men,\" Mlambo-Ngcuka said in a recent interview with the Associated Press. \"We need to win the priests, the rabbis, the traditional chiefs.\"", "European men grew HOW much taller in just one century? The research, published Monday in the journal Oxford Economic Papers, looked at data from the 1870s to 1980. During that time frame, the average height of European men surged from 167 cm (5 ft, 5in) to 178 cm (5 ft, 10 in) -- that's a rate of around a millimeter each year and a centimeter each decade. \"Increases in human stature are a key indicator of improvements in the average health of populations,\" Dr. Timothy J. Hatton, economics professor at the University of Essex in the U.K. and Australian National University in Canberra, said in a written statement. So what explains the growth? \"The evidence suggests that the improving disease environment, as reflected in the fall in infant mortality, is the single most important factor driving the increase in height,\" Hatton said in the statement. Another possible reason might be the downward trend in fertility and family sizes, which have previously been linked to height increases, Reuters reported. Higher per capita income, better social services and nutrition may have played a role as well. Then does this mean how tall you are reflects how healthy you are? Not so fast. \"We can't conclude that shorter men are somehow unhealthier. Like a", "Why do we #snore?\n@healthmeup. But what causes you to snore? Snoring happens when you can't move air freely through your nose and throat during sleep. This makes the surrounding tissues vibrate, which produces the familiar snoring sound. From an anatomical standpoint, snoring is caused by a partially closed upper airway (the nose and throat).  Everyone\u2019s neck muscles relax during sleep, but sometimes they relax so much that the upper airway partly closes and becomes too narrow for enough air to travel through to the lungs.  Why do some people snore and others don't? Those who have enlarged tonsils, an enlarged tongue or excess weight around the neck are more prone to snoring. The sound itself is an indicator that the person who is snoring has a narrow airway. 40% of normal adults snore regularly, whether they realise it or not. What is snoring doing to your body? Not everyone, but a lot of people who snore also suffer from sleep apnea. Basically, it prevents you from getting the healthy sleep you need to lead a refreshed, energetic life. 3 in 10 men and 2 in 10 women who are habitual snorers suffer from this.  So if you snore and if you are", "5 things you should avoid doing if you want to look professional:.

A recent TIME study may have put to rest whether the aisle or window seat is better. It turns out the answer is neither of them; middle seats in the rear of the aircraft are the safest place to sit. Most Popular The center seats farther up in the aircraft are a different story, though. \"The middle of the cabin, historically, has the highest overall fatality rates\u2013more specifically the middle aisle seats....The fatality rate [in middle seats near the back of the plane] is 28%, compared to 44% [in the aisle seats in the middle of the plane],\" says the publication. Other safe spots are the two rows closest to the emergency exit. Why? The study's hunch is that those seated there could exit the plane more quickly if they had to. Still, the publication notes that these findings aren't the be-all and end-all. First, the data merely found a link between those locations on the plane and death rates; it doesn't mean that those seats caused or prevented death. Plus, the results are based on 17 crashes over the past 30 years, which is a small sample size. TIME also reminds readers that following safety instructions and keeping your seat", "UPDATE: Prof slammed to the ground and arrested university planning further review. On May 20, Ersula Ore, an English professor, was stopped by university police near the ASU campus. Police said Ore was stopped because she was walking in the middle of the street and refused to provide ID, and that she later kicked an officer in the shin after they had her handcuffed, according to the Associated Press. Ore claimed she was walking in the street to get around construction. Now, dashboard video of Ore's interaction with Officer Stewart Ferrin, showing Ore being physically forced down to the pavement, is attracting attention as she claims police used excessive force. Video released to KTVK (above) shows part of the exchange between Ferrin and Ore: Ferrin: \"Let me see your ID or you will be arrested for failing to provide ID.\" Ore: \"Are you serious?\" Ferrin: \"Yes, I am serious. That is the law.\" In the video, Ore can be heard saying she has no problem following the law, but protesting that Ferrin is speaking to her in a disrespectful manner.

It's the first time Amazon has increased the annual fee on its popular membership program in its nine-year existence. In addition to free shipping on some items, Prime customers get access to Amazon's library of more than 40,000 streaming movies and television shows and to Amazon's Kindle Owner's Lending Library of books to read. Though Amazon has refused to divulge the exact number of people it's enrolled in Prime, in December it said it was in the \"tens of millions,\" meaning that $20 price bump will give Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue. \"Even as fuel and transportation costs have increased, the price of Prime has remained the same,\" Amazon told The Huffington Post by email. \"If you consider things like inflation and fuel costs, a Prime membership valued at $79 in 2005 would be worth more than $100 today.\" Amazon sent a similar statement to some Prime customers to justify the increase. Current Amazon Prime members will pay the increased fee when they renew, starting on April 17. Any new customer who signs up starting March 20 will also pay $99. The good news, at least for those without Prime yet, is that the $79 price will", "The book we're talking about this summer. by Rebecca Makkai Viking Adult, $26.95 Published July 10, 2014 The Book We're Talking About is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book. What we think: Fictional estates -- Henry James\u2019s Bly, Daphne du Maurier\u2019s Manderly -- have long served as more than confined settings for plots to unravel in. Like characters, they\u2019re given names, and serve as catalysts for action. Unlike most characters, they don\u2019t typically exhibit a capacity for change. They are concrete reminders of the fixed, often haunting past.

Professional athletes don't get to the top by accident. It takes superhuman levels of time, dedication, and focus\u2014and that includes paying attention to what they put in their bellies. In this series, GQ takes a look at what pro athletes in different sports eat on a daily basis to perform at their best. Here's a look at the junk food-filled, weight-gain diet of pro trainer Adonis Hill. The trainer-with-an-inspiring-backstory is pretty common. He doesn\u2019t just pump you up, he motivates you with tales of his obese childhood and his rigorous climb to rippling, well-muscled perfection. What you don't see too often, though, is a trainer who used to be fat going out of his way to get flabby again. Adonis Hill used to weigh 310 pounds. Five years ago, he vowed to keep it off for good, and managed to maintain his weight at a chiseled 190. \"I know what it\u2019s like,\" he says. \"I would lose weight, gain it back, lose weight, gain weight back.\" Then the Brooklyn-based trainer signed up to be on A&E\u2019s Fit to Fat to Fit, a Biggest Loser-esque reality show where trainers gain weight so they can lose it again with their clients.

In August this year, Mark and Jacoba Tromp and their adult children Ella, Riana and Mitchell left their home in Silvan, east of Melbourne, taking cash but leaving behind bank cards and mobile phones. Police found the house unlocked, with paperwork everywhere. As they drove towards NSW, Mitchell's phone was thrown out the car window. One day later he left the family trip at Bathurst, describing his parents as scared, paranoid and worried they were being followed. The two girls left their parents at Goulburn, where Riana was hospitalised with stress-related issues. The family's car was later pulled over in Wangaratta, after police received a report it was following another car, and a man, believed to be Mark, ran away into a nearby park.

A new study from Tel Aviv University found that synthetic cannabis users \u2014 compared to users of regular cannabis \u2014 in psychiatric centers tended to be younger men, showed more severe psychotic symptoms, stayed hospitalized longer, had a previous record of being hospitalized and were more likely to be hospitalized by criminal court order.

The study group was relatively small \u2014 60 self-reported synthetic cannabis smokers, 163 non-synthetic users \u2014 but made a clear point: The man-made version of marijuana is a wrecking ball in your brain and could land you in psychiatric care.

Then Dad Sees What The Worker Did To His Kid\u2019s Lunch... When they arrived at the restaurant and picked up their sandwiches, dad took his girl to a table and they started eating. Since she is allergic to peanuts, her dad, John Russo, was careful to alert the cooks. Plus, he ordered a grilled cheese for her, so there should be no worries. But since Panera Bread employs immigrants in the kitchen who are unable to read or understand English, his girl started vomiting and was rushed to the ER. But dad\u2019s jaw dropped when he saw what was inside her sandwich. After his 6-year-old girl said her sandwich tasted \"weird,\" dad peeled the grilled cheese open. Inside, smack dab in the center, dad saw a large dollop of peanut butter. It was almost like the cooks at Panera Bread were trying to kill the severely allergic girl. John Russo, the father of the victim, called 911 and his daughter was airlifted to a nearby hospital after she started vomiting and went into anaphylactic shock.

If your eyebrows were more than one hair wide, you were considered profoundly unfashionable. 2. Bleaching your hair on top and dyeing it black underneath. For some reason, it was all about the contrast in the '00s. 3. Coating your eyelashes in up to six layers of mascara.  The more lashes you could get to clump together, the better. 4. Applying shimmery pastel eyeshadow to your eyelids.  So glamorous! 5. Covering your face and chest in sooooo much bronzer.  You wanted to look like you were from The O.C., but realistically, you just looked like a tangerine. 6. Getting a feathered haircut and then flipping out the bottoms of your hair with curling tongs.  It was all about the ~TeXtUrE~. 7. Using Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse. It was very important that your entire face was one colour. 8. Giving yourself chunky highlights from a Superdrug packet.  The bigger the difference between your two hair colours, the better. 9. Wearing a very thick plastic headband that did not pull any of your hair back.  They were always either black or white. 10. Side ponytails. ", "This waitress got the tip of a lifetime. According to ABC affiliate WHTM, Mainier had been on shift at the Peachtree Restaurant and Lounge in Harrisburg, Pa., chatting with a regular customer in 2010, when she happened to tell him about her money troubles. She was working to pay her way through college, she told the older man, and was struggling under the weight of massive student loans. \"He said, 'I'd love to help you,'\" Mainier told Yahoo! Shine of the exchange. \"I was like, 'help me? What is he talking about?' He elaborated, and he said if I needed help financially, he would be happy to help.\" Mainier, it turned out, had been chatting with Benjamin Olewine III, a philanthropist known in the Harrisburg area for his big-hearted generosity. Though just a stranger to Mainier at the time, he immediately offered to help cover her college tuition. Mainier, however, was reluctant to accept the help of someone she didn't know and initially turned him down. But according to Yahoo!, Olewine persisted until she finally accepted. Mainier, who now works as a nurse, estimates that Olewine has shelled out about $30,000 for her tuition and other school-related expenses. Olewine's unstinting generosity has been well-documented.

Purdue University A group of engineering students from Purdue University reported that its licking machine, modeled after a human tongue, took an average of 364 licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.

The final presidential debate , which began Wednesday night in Las Vegas, is the last big set piece of the 2016 election, and perhaps the last chance for the Republican nominee to muscle his way back into an increasingly lopsided race . It will be an uphill battle. Trump's poor campaign performances, and a rash of recent allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances toward women in the past, have sent the billionaire businessman plummeting in the polls. With three weeks until Election Day, he now trails by an average of seven percentage points in national surveys. The battleground map looks little better. Most Republican and Democratic strategists alike now believe that Hillary Clinton is coasting toward victory. Sensing a decisive advantage, Clinton advisers are making a play to run up the score, contesting traditionally Republican states like Arizona and funneling resources into Senate contests in Indiana and Missouri. Trump has responded to his slump in the polls by lobbing a fusillade of attacks against American democracy itself. For more than a week now, the centerpiece of his stump speeches has been the claim that the race is being \"rigged\" by a vast conspiracy that includes the Clintons, global elites and", "Here\u2019s Sony\u2019s Response To Microsoft\u2019s Invite to Connect Xbox One and PS4 Networks.

Although she gave up acting eventually, Carr fondly recounted her experiences on the \"Sound Of Music\" set in her books \"Forever Liesl\" and \"Letters To Liesl.\" Nicholas Hammond, Friederich von Trapp Now a resident of Australia, Nicholas Hammond is an actor, writer and producer. But his work doesn't shy away from his \"Sound Of Music\" days: Hammond recently worked on and starred in an award-winning documentary called \"Climbed Every Mountain with Nicholas Hammond,\" which explores the true story of the von Trapp family. Heather Menzies, Louisa von Trapp After taking on several roles in the '70s and '80s and even posing nude for Playboy in 1973, Menzies went on to become an advocate for cancer patients and their families. She is now a mother of three and the founder of the Uhrich Foundation For Cancer Research, named", "Guess which famous Andy Warhol painting could fetch $60 million this fall. Yes, you read that right. It could set you back up to $60 million. Created in 1962, the massive, human-sized canvas is heading to auction in New York City this fall, as part of Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art sale. The work had been housed in a previous collection for the past two decades, making cameo appearances at almost every Warhol retrospective in recent memory, Christie's explained in a press statement. But the stark soda masterpiece is officially up for grabs on November 12, 2013. That is, if you have $40 to $60 million sitting around. \"What\u2019s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest,\" Andy Warhol once quipped. \"You can be watching TV and see Coca Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca Cola, too.\" But if you happen to catch sight of Warhol's \"Coca-Cola (3)\" -- which will be on view in London from October 12-18, don't be fooled.

I actually taught right when I got out of college, really briefly, and I remember always thinking -- cause I loved writing -- and I remember thinking that the English textbooks were really lame and I always wanted to write a really cool one.

Whether due to financial aid requirements, sports scholarships, naked ambition, or just plain fear of their parents, many students care deeply about their grades This leads thousands of them, every semester, at every postsecondary institution in this great land, to utter one fateful plea to the person on the other side of the lectern. They make this plea to help them achieve their goals, yet it is one of the most ill-advised things any student can do. It usually arrives via email at a strange hour of the night. It goes like this: \"Professor, I NEED an A in this class.\" All right, I admit: I\u2019m indulging in the time-honored rhetorical device of hyperbole. Not all professors get this all the time.

It's a 14-year-old girl's worst nightmare. You're standing in front of your class when giggling erupts from the back and everyone's pointing at your behind. With despair you realise your sanitary pad has leaked and an embarrassing circle of blood has appeared on your dress. I clearly remember the anxious checking of my school skirt as a teenager. You'd pull aside a close friend: \"Have I leaked?\" But the worst never actually happened and I don't remember seeing it happen to any classmates. Because in the West we're blessed with effective, disposable, affordable sanitary protection - the vast majority of us can afford pads or tampons every month. Here in Malawi, that's not the case. The sanitary pads in the shops cost 500 Malawi kwacha (75 cents; 50p) per pack. That's nearly a whole day's pay at the minimum wage - and you really need two packs per period. Imagine spending two days' wages every month just on sanitary pads. To find out what women do instead, I head to a school in a township on the outskirts of Blantyre, Malawi's second city, to talk periods with a group of teenage girls. \"Tell me,\" I venture. \"We're here to talk about", "These guys are getting a Comedy Central show. Here's why. Comedy Central is adding to its already impressive list of original shows by giving BriTANick, the online sketch duo made up of Brian McElhaney and Nick Kocher, a half-hour scripted pilot. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the show -- which will also be called \"BriTaNick\" -- will see McElhaney and Kocher playing exaggerated versions of themselves and feature stories based on their real lives. \"BriTANick\" will join a slew of other of the network's popular comedies, such as \"Broad City,\" \"Inside Amy Schumer,\" \"Workaholics,\" \"Key and Peele,\" \"The Kroll Show\" and \"South Park.\" For those who may still be wondering why McElhaney and Kocher deserve to have a show alongside these comedies, here's our version of proof: When they hit it, they hit it big. The two gained recognition and popularity when their video \"Academy Award Winning Movie Trailer\" went viral and was nominated for \"Viral Video of the Year\" at the Comedy Awards in 2011.

It sounds so wrong, but IKEA's Scandinavian reps confirm that the authentic way to say the brand is with a long \"e\" (not \"i\") sound at the beginning, followed by the emphasized second syllable \"KAY.\" Of course, the clever execs knew all along that the new market would butcher the name, so they actually embraced our American accents from the start. When the company launched in the U.S. in 1985, they specifically decided to use the alternate pronunciation, IKEA U.S. spokeswoman Marty Marston told ABC News. They even ran a billboard campaign with the images of an eyeball, key, and a person saying \"ah.\" So really, don't blame yourself for the misunderstanding. Most Popular \"I think they realized back then that Americans would automatically pronounce it with an 'i' sound,\" said Marston, who changes her pronunciation when she visits the Swedish headquarters. \"I have to make a point out of saying it the way they do or they will look at me in a funny way,\" she explained.", "Trader thinks this currency will replace the whole global financial system \u00bb. First, the basics on bitcoin as explained in the book: It was created by an anonymous person who calls himself (or herself) Satoshi Nakamoto. This person, whose true identity has still not been disclosed, released a white paper amid the 2008 credit crisis explaining the digital currency. He and subsequent bitcoin \"miners\" created the early units of the currency shortly thereafter. Each unit has an encrypted key which fits uniquely into a spot in the so-called blockchain. Every piece of bitcoin created has a unique spot on this blockchain. This special construction ensures security during transactions as well as prevents counterfeiting. Because of these security features, bitcoin removes an essential element that was thought to be necessary for every financial transaction: trust. If trust isn't needed, one doesn't need that middleman when making a wire transfer (credit card companies), states the author. The middleman needed to ensure both parties meet their commitments for a home, car or business loan (banks) isn't needed either. Kelly writes: \"The Bitcoin protocol replaces the banker with the miner and by doing so removes the cost of a middleman.

A third grader had made a comment about the brownies being served to the class. After another student exclaimed that the remark was \"racist,\" the school called the Collingswood Police Department, according to the mother of the boy who made the comment. The police officer spoke to the student, who is 9, said the boy's mother, Stacy dos Santos, and local authorities. Dos Santos said that the school overreacted and that her son made a comment about snacks, not skin color. \"He said they were talking about brownies. . . . Who exactly did he offend?\" dos Santos said. The boy's father was contacted by Collingswood police later in the day. Police said the incident had been referred to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency. The student stayed home for his last day of third grade. Dos Santos said that her son was \"traumatized,\" and that she hopes to send him to a different Collingswood public school in the fall. And she wants an apology.

In the US, the FDA oversees cosmetics. But unlike drugs (which must get approval before they can be sold), cosmetics do not. As a result, companies that use or sell unsafe ingredients usually only get in trouble if they get caught. According to the FDA's website, it's up to individual companies, rather than the FDA, to ensure their products are safe. Compared to Canada and the European Union, both of whom have pretty strict oversight over cosmetics, the FDA has very few hard-and-fast rules. Here's what is still lurking in our cosmetics: Lipstick The makeup brand Lime Crime came under fire from the FDA in July for having color additives, the single ingredient the FDA does require approval for in cosmetics, in some of its products. \"Color is something that the FDA takes very seriously,\" said Robert Lochhead, a polymer science professor at the University of Southern Mississippi.

There are also issues like memory loss and the decrease in cognitive functions to contend with. A small strata of society, referred to as \"superagers\" by neurologist Marsel Mesulam, not only retain their mental sharpness well into old age, but their cognitive abilities might even rival that of a healthy 25 year old. Neurologist Lisa Feldman Barrett and her team studied the brains of 17 of these 'superagers', and compared them with people of a similar age. Findings showed that the brain regions associated with emotion \u2013 like the midcingulate cortex and the anterior insula - were thicker in the superagers, and thinner for regular agers. They theorised these regions were responsible for their more alert state. Now for the question on everyone's lips: Barrett puts it simply as this: work hard at something. Characterising the brain as a muscle, the only way to make it strong is by consistently pushing it to its limits. The brain regions which are thicker in superagers are active when a person undergoes a difficult task that requires concentration, whether that is mental \u2013 like regularly playing chess, or solving difficult maths equations \u2013 or physical.

Because my long-held hunch -- based on many years of following this stuff as a health and science writer -- has been that coffee is probably not bad for you, and may even be quite good for you, a theory now backed by a recent video post from Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Carroll combs through an impressive amount of high-quality data and finds almost no evidence that even the more enthusiastic coffee drinkers among us -- those who down five or six or even seven cups a day -- are risking their health for their favored vice. Coffee consumption, in fact, probably shouldn't even be considered a vice, says Carroll, though he notes that it's the stuff we put in our coffee -- sugar and flavored syrup and the like -- that turns it into liquid candy. \"It's way past time that we stopped viewing coffee itself as something we need to cut back on,\" he concludes.

The \"Uncle Rhabdo\" cartoon depicts an exhausted, yet well-muscled clown, connected to a dialysis machine standing next to some workout equipment. Concernedly, his kidney has fallen out and lies on the floor underneath him, along with some portion of his bowel. He's left a pool of blood on the floor below him, but it's not clear if this is from the disembowelment, the kidney's arterial supply, or the collection of fasciotomies he appears to have endured. Uncle Rhabdo, of course, has rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis, apart from being a subtly pleasant and melodic sounding word, is an uncool, serious and potentially fatal condition resulting from the catastrophic breakdown of muscle cells. We'll get more into the specifics in just a bit, but first let's begin with a story. A Tale of Rhabdomyolysis One day, a very fit, young, physical therapist colleague of mine went to CrossFit. She had been many times before. On this warm Texas evening, she performed a partner workout, where each would trade off", "Scientists Now Know What Really Wiped Out Dinosaurs. A new study has provided an updated theory about how the dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago. Scientific Reports journal puts forward the theory that a massive asteroid did indeed strike the Earth, but that its devastating effects were different than commonly thought, reports The Independent. A paper published in thejournal puts forward the theory that a massive asteroid did indeed strike the Earth, but that its devastating effects were different than commonly thought, reports Researchers \u2013 from Japan\u2019s Meteorological Research Institute and Tohuku Univeristy \u2013 now believe the asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, hitting massive oil deposits and sending a blanket of thick black smoke into the atmosphere, engulfing the planet. The amount of sunlight fell by a huge 85 per cent, causing the Earth to cool by as much as 16 degrees Celsius on land for about three years. Also, rainfall would have fallen by roughly 80 per cent causing extreme and devastating droughts. The researchers wrote: Small mammals and reptiles could have lived underground where it is warmer \u2013 dinosaurs did not. These different habitats would have been key factors in determining their extinction or survival. Wikimedia Experts had previously wondered why dinosaurs had", "You can help! A hotel's trying to find homeless man to thank him for being awesome. The man, believed to be named Josh Crabber, found a guest's wallet in a trash can while looking for food. Instead of using the credit cards to his benefit, Crabber, who is thought to be homeless, went to several hotels in search of the wallet's owner, eventually returning it to the Omni. According to the Associated Press, the wallet's owner had been robbed earlier that day, and the thieves made off with her entire purse, apparently discarding the contents in a garbage nearby. As a thank-you for Crabber's noble deed, the hotel wants to return the favor. \"Every person has a story and this person obviously has a story and did the right thing by bringing [the wallet] to try to find [its owner],\" the hotel's managing director, Scott Stuckey, told Atlanta's WSB-TV. \"When you're looking through food in the garbage can, it's probably one of the toughest times of [your] life. But when you find somebody's wallet and you do the right thing, I think we'd like to do the right thing by this person.\" Stuckey told the station they'd like to give the man $500 for his efforts, in addition to putting him up in a room for Thanksgiving,", "Hollywood had its worst summer in over a decade and here's why. The blockbuster summer of 2016 will probably go down as one of the worst summers that Hollywood studio movies have ever experienced. Despite earning box office receipts only fractionally lower than those earned in the $11 billion (\u00a38bn) bumper year of 2015, it\u2019ll likely be remembered as the worst year since 2001. So why are critics and fans alike bemoaning how abysmal 2016 has been? Fox Movies There are a lot of definitive reasons for the backlash happening against blockbusters and some that are purely speculative. But one of the undeniable factors is that there are simply too many studios trying to make too many tent-pole movies, without the audience share to go around. That means that more massive movies are competing for the same amount of box office takings. In that scenario, unfortunately, there are going to be casualties like The BFG, which despite being critically acclaimed and having a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 75 per cent, was widely seen to have flopped. Paramount But it\u2019s not just gate receipts that films are being maligned for.

Minter captures her subject up close and hyper-personal, simultaneously glossy and completely unarmed. This photograph of Anderson is heading to the auction block at Christie's upcoming First Open: New Media sale, which will explore the way new technologies have shaped artistic production and possibility.

If you climb into bed with the day's grime still covering your body, you'll need to wash the sheets much more frequently. 2. You like to relax before bed Just like how morning showers can stimulate creativity, night showers can help you unwind after a long day. A nice hot shower can relax your muscles and give you a chance to be alone with your thoughts, which can also help you fall asleep faster. 3. You have dry skin or wear a lot of makeup Those with oily skin may benefit from a shower first thing in the morning, but for people with dry skin morning showers can just exacerbate the problem. And if you wear makeup, it's important to remember to wash it off every night. While simply washing your face at night is usually enough to keep clean, the steam from the shower can help deep clean your pores more effectively. 4. You accumulate lots of dirt during the day If you barely break a sweat all day, you may not have much to wash off before bed.", "Bet you didn't know government jobs paid so well :p.

You may or may not know that Steve Buscemi was a firefighter from 1980-1984. The day after the attacks on the Twin Towers, he turned up at his old fire station ready for work. He spent the next week doing 12-hour shifts and helping his former colleagues search for the bodies of the missing. When people tried to get photos or interview him - he outright refused. Buscemi had worked as a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) firefighter with Engine 55 in Little Italy. He stayed in touch with some of his old fire company colleagues, even when he went on to be a Hollywood superstar.

State lawmakers are moving forward this week with a vote on legislation that would bar the University of Tennessee (UT) and other public institutions of higher education from using institutional revenue to \"engage and pay visiting or guest speakers for events.\" Even commencement speakers who asked the school to cover travel and lodging costs or who sought a speaker fee would be eliminated. (The legislation would not prevent the hiring of guest faculty to conduct classes for which students receive credit.) Another bill would require state colleges to distribute student fees to pay for guest speakers \"proportionally based on membership\" of the student groups inviting the speaker. Both of these bills were authored by state Sen. Stacey Campfield (R-Knoxville) and were scheduled for their first committee vote on Wednesday. They are being pushed in response to Sex Week, a week-long student-organized and student-funded event at UT's Knoxville campus discussing sexuality, LGBT issues, sexual health and related topics. Campfield previously gained national recognition -- and stirred national controversy -- in 2012 for his \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which would have prevented schoolteachers from discussing homosexuality.

Prosecutors in Rome say they have their man. ROME \u2014 Stealing an expensive Rolex off the corpse of a foe is just the type of thing one might envision Tony Soprano ordering one of his petty thugs to carry out.

The first is equity through surveys, consumers answer questions like which brands they prefer and intend to purchase. Brand Finance rolls these responses up into an equity metric and assigns it 50% of the brand power score. The second dimension, brand input, measures how much money brands spend on marketing. The more you spend, the higher you rank. The last piece, output, looks at a company's profit margins and prices.

And in the workplace putting your needs before those of your colleagues is often seen as selfish behaviour. But new research says being selfless at work can backfire. Giving at the expense of your own well-being damages your chance of long-term success. In an article for The Harvard Business Review, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania professor, Dr Adam Grant and Wharton People Analytics researcher Reb Rebele explore the 'generosity burnout'. They believe that selflessness at work leads to exhaustion, and ironically often hurts the people you intended to help. 'Although givers are the most valuable people in organizations, they\u2019re also at the greatest risk for burnout', the authors wrote in The Harvard Business Review. 'When they don\u2019t protect themselves, their investments in others can cause them to feel overloaded and fatigued, fall behind in their work goals, and face more stress and conflict at home', they said. In their currently unpublished research, authors Dr Grant and Mr Rebele studied a range of jobs. One data set came from a study conducted with more than 400 teachers in schools throughout the US.

Researchers from Ohio State University originally launched a study on the Amish population to see whether rates of cancer would be higher due to their lack of conventional medical care. What they found, however, shocked them. The Amish were found to have much lower rates of cancer than the rest of the population, so researchers decided to look more closely at their lifestyle choices and diets to find out why. Most Amish people do not smoke or drink and they are typically not sexually promiscuous, leading researchers to believe that these lifestyle factors play an important role in the limited number of cancer cases. Other factors examined include the high amount of physical labor undertaken by the Amish. Most Amish people work in farming, construction, and other production jobs that require intense physical activity that keeps them healthy and in shape. While the rest of America sits in fluorescent-lit cubicles all day, the Amish work hard to produce crops, build furniture and structures, and produce useful goods, which researchers recognize contributes to their excellent health. Another important factor not specifically examined in the study is the fact that the Amish grow and raise all their own food.

The Chinese researchers, led by Yuanyuan Cai from Sun Yat-Sen University, analyzed all available studies involving air pollution and blood pressure and found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants, including ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, were more likely to have high blood pressure\u2014readings above 140 mm Hg for the first number in the ratio\u2014than those exposed to lower amounts of pollutants. Exposure to particulates, the tiny, hard-to-see particles of pollutants circulating the air, also contribute to higher blood pressures. The effect held for both short-term and long-term exposure to the pollution, and the increased risk of hypertension remained strong even after the researchers adjusted for other factors that could contribute to elevated blood pressure, including a history of heart problems and higher BMI. More research is needed, as the findings are the first to look at both short-term and more lasting effects of pollution on blood pressure. It\u2019s not clear yet, for example, whether people who already have hypertension will experience even higher elevations if they live in polluted areas. The scientists are also planning", "There's a Rumored Release Date for Metallica's New Album. According to Bild , the band's still-untitled 10th studio album could arrive October 14.

A seemingly obscure legal decision was reached this week, but it affects our use and enjoyment of the Internet, and ensures that we won't be charged more for it. The decision upheld the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) regulation that supports net neutrality. Net neutrality means that the Internet service providers or broadband carriers treat all data that travels over their networks in exactly the same way, much like our telephone service and power are regulated. It\u2019s the way the Internet has worked since its inception and we know how the Internet has transformed our lives in nearly everything we do. It\u2019s also spawned innovation and many new companies to create products and services we never imagined. But for many years, there has been an effort to change all this, led by the broadband carriers Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. They've wanted to offer different classes of Internet services, one that provides faster speeds and better access to those websites that pay, and a slower access speed for those that don't want to pay. It was a way for these companies with with limited competition to generate more revenue, but it would also mean that the bigger companies that could pay more for", "What happens when millennials grow up? We share apartments with people we don't know or with our parents, live hand-to-mouth, and subscribe to a culture of anxiety. We struggle with self esteem and live our social lives online. We know what we should be because we learned it from our parents, who got married when they were our age and had kids, a mortgage, and a hatchback just a few years later. But us? We're fully grown adults living in a state of suspended childhood. So what happens in 20 years when we're all nearly middle-aged? What happens when millennials grow up? One image immediately comes to mind: a single 43-year-old burdened with mental-health issues, living in a shoebox apartment that costs $2,500 a month, scrolling obsessively through Tinder, and tweeting about the latest Palace drop to an audience of desperately lonely peers.

But I say pish! to prevailing wisdom, so... Everything you know is wrong Instead of the above approach that largely ignores reality, I believe there are two questions we need to ask: Did the user understand that they were supposed to type an email address into this field? Did the user correctly type their email address into this field? If you have a well laid-out form with a label that says \"email\", and the user enters an \u2018@\u2019 symbol somewhere, then it\u2019s safe to say they understood that they were supposed to be entering an email address.

For the study, published in the March 9 online edition of JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers kept track of 77,000 men and women over the course of seven years. Roughly half the participants were meat-eaters, and the others fell into four vegetarian-like groups: Semi-vegetarians (ate meat less than once a week), pesco-vegetarians (ate fish but not other meat), lacto-ovo vegetarians (ate eggs and dairy but no meat) and vegans (no meat, no dairy, no eggs). Researchers found that after seven years, there were 380 colon cancer cases and 110 rectal cancer cases among the group. As it turns out, vegetarians were less likely to develop the disease compared to participants who ate meat, but pesco-vegetarians, in particular, were the real winners. \"All vegetarians together had on average a 22 percent reduction in the risk of developing colorectal cancer, compared with non-vegetarians,\" lead researcher Dr. Michael Orlich said, according to CBS. Those who ate fish, on the other hand, saw a 43 percent reduction rate. However, it should be noted there's still no concrete evidence that this reduction in colorectal cancer is due to diet. \"That's the problem in dietary studies of cancer.

Luckily, there are lots of ways to better your lifestyle without throwing your daily routine out of whack. We've put together a list of some relatively small changes you can make to your life right now to start living healthier. Eat fruit instead of candy. Candy is sweet because it contains processed sugar, usually high-fructose corn syrup. Fruit is sweet because it contains natural sugar, but it's still good for you because it's also rich in fiber, which helps you digest the sugar more slowly. Shop on a full stomach. Studies show that people who snack before a grocery trip buy fewer unhealthy foods, possibly because they aren't driven to make impulse buys out of hunger. While you're at it, learn how to cook. Studies have shown that dieting doesn't work, because cutting out entire foods only makes you want to eat more of them. But cooking at home is linked to eating healthier, saving money on dining out, and boosting self-esteem. Drink your coffee black.

Apple\u2019s recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are available in a whole new color this time around, with the Jet Black offerings proving popular amongst those who have managed to get their hands on one. Unfortunately, managing to do that has been hard work, with the manufacturing process required in order to create that Jet Black chassis said to be causing problems for Apple and its suppliers. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, as many as 40% of the Jet Black iPhones that are currently being made are failing to pass Apple\u2019s quality checking process, which then requires them to be remade. This considerable rejection rate is believed to be behind a worldwide shortage of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets in that particular finish, with shipping estimates for Jet Black iPhones almost immediately stretching out into October and beyond once iPhones were available for pre-order. As Kuo notes, though, normal iPhone demand may not be the only reason for such stock delays, with Samsung\u2019s recent Galaxy Note 7 recall potentially part of the reason demand has been so high.

She spoke with actor Tom Hiddleston on the subject in an interview for Elle UK's November issue: I want every version of a woman and a man to be possible. I want women and men to be able to be full-time parents or full-time working people or any combination of the two. I want both to be able to do whatever they want sexually without being called names. I want them to be allowed to be weak and strong and happy and sad -- human, basically. The fallacy in Hollywood is that if you\u2019re making a \"feminist\" story, the woman kicks ass and wins. That\u2019s not feminist, that\u2019s macho. A movie about a weak, vulnerable woman can be feminist if it shows a real person that we can empathize with. We are 100 percent with Portman on this one. Of course there should be more nuanced and complex women being portrayed in film and on television. And Portman's thoughts seem to echo Sophia McDougall's argument against the label \"strong female character\" in the New Statesman. \"No one ever asks if a male character is 'strong.' Nor if he\u2019s 'feisty,' or 'kick-ass' come to that,\" she writes. No one asks those questions", "@MicheleBachmann: Obama is funding terrorists. In an interview Saturday with Jan Markell on the Christian radio program \"Understanding the Times,\" Bachmann accused President Barack Obama of giving aid to terrorists. This, she says, is solid evidence that we have entered the Last Days. \"President Obama waived a ban on arming terrorists in order to allow weapons to go to the Syrian opposition,\" Bachmann said. \"Your listeners, U.S. taxpayers, are now paying to give arms to terrorists including al Qaeda.\" She continued: This happened, and as of today, the United States is willingly, knowingly, intentionally sending arms to terrorists, now what this says to me, I\u2019m a believer in Jesus Christ, as I look at the End Times scripture, this says to me that the leaf is on the fig tree and we are to understand the signs of the times, which is your ministry, we are to understand where we are in God\u2019s end time history.

The person who posted it on Reddit simply asked if anyone could find the legs of the girl in the middle of the couch photo. \"I commented saying, 'This is so weird, where are my legs?,' and then from there it just kind of escalated,\" said Anna Mantifel, the woman seated third from left. \"I think I can speak for everyone when I say we never anticipated it to go this far.\" Many theories were put forth, with some questioning whether it was simply an optical illusion created by the lighting and camera angle. \"Once we kind of figured out Anna's legs were missing, it also kind of looked weird by me too, so it's kind of confusing on this side of the couch in general,\" said Kelly McCarthy, seated second from left.

A few hours later, he had completed the transaction, having agreed to pay $11,900 for the used motorcycle. \"I learned to ride when I lived in Creighton, and there weren\u2019t many people there. Sometimes I would see people I didn\u2019t know, and they would wave to me.

Google celebrated what would have been Celia Cruz's 88th birthday Monday with a doodle honoring the Cuban singer who rose to international stardom as one of the world's greatest salsa singers. \"There have been many posthumous tributes to Celia in these last ten years, but this one by Google is certainly one of the most important and far-reaching,\" Omer Pardillo-Cid, sole executor of the Celia Cruz Estate, said in a press release. \"She would have loved it!\" Born U\u0301rsula Hilaria Celia de la Caridad Cruz Alfonso to a working-class family in Havana in 1925, Cruz took up singing as a child -- an interest later encouraged by her aunt, who introduced her to the world of Cuba's nightclubs, according to Billboard. A student of Cuba's Conservatory of Music, Cruz's career took off in 1950 when she joined La Sonora Matancera, one of Cuba's most prominent dance orchestras. The singer left the island while on tour with La Sonora Matancera in 1960, shortly after the Cuban Revolution, and never returned.

The actor will play part of a father-son duo that steals an idea for an innovation from Jason Bateman's, Jason Sudeikis' and Charlie Day's characters. Deadline.com reported last week that Pine was being eyed for the role in \"Bosses,\" but now the deal is official. Christoph Waltz was in negotiations to portray Pine's father, but the Oscar-winning actor passed on the role, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Horrible Bosses 2\" hit a snag in August when director Seth Gordon bowed out of the project to focus on the ABC series \"The Goldbergs.\" Sean Anders and John Morris, who together wrote \"We're the Millers\" and \"Hot Tub Time Machine,\" will now helm the movie, with Anders serving as director and Morris filling the role of executive producer. The first \"Bosses,\" released in 2011, received moderate praise from critics and became a substantial box office hit, earning $210 million worldwide on a $37 million budget. The movie's sequel is slated for a Nov. 26, 2014, release.

In case you're in the second group, some background: every state has some sort of law that discourages people from traveling in the left lane on multi-lane roads and highways. It's not that you're never allowed in the left lane, just that you should only use it when necessary, for passing, then get back over. That's because even if you're driving fast, there's always someone going faster. If you promptly get back over after passing, that car will be able to pass you, allowing everyone on the road to get to their destinations as quickly as possible. If you don't, it'll inevitably lead to buildups of traffic and likely raise the chance of accidents. The system works best when people aren't hogging the left lane. That's one reason why National Motorists Association has declared June Lane Courtesy Month in an effort to to raise awareness about the importance of getting out of the left lane.

That's when NASA scientists are predicting the hole in the ozone layer might finally make a full recovery. Researchers announced their conclusion, in addition to other findings, in a presentation Wednesday during the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. The team of scientists specifically looked at the chemical composition of the ozone hole, which has shifted in both size and depth since the passing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. The agreement banned its 197 signatory countries from using chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that break down into chlorine in the upper atmosphere and harm the ozone layer. They found that, while levels of chlorine in the atmosphere have indeed decreased as a result of the protocol, it's too soon to tie them to a healthier ozone layer. \"Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline,\" Susan Strahan of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center explained in a media briefing. \"That assumption is like trying to understand what's wrong with your car's engine without lifting the hood.\" Instead, the scientists believe the most recent ozone hole changes, including both the largest hole ever, in 2006,", "The real reason @CindyCrawford kept her mole.

Backstage at Lela Rose and Costello Tagliapietra's Spring 2014 shows, makeup artists dressed up the models' lids with an unusual shade: lime green. The spring color worked surprisingly well on all the different models' skin tones, however, it stood out particularly on the redheads. With such a vibrant eyeshadow color on the lids, it is key to keep the rest of the face pared down.

Millions aren\u2019t saving on the job because they either don\u2019t have access to a workplace retirement plan or they do but aren\u2019t putting money in it. Many just can\u2019t spare the cash, but a new analysis shows there are other reasons, too. Until now, the exact size of the problem has been unclear. Surveys can be unreliable: Small businesses are difficult to assess, and many workers just don\u2019t know what plan options they have, especially if employers aren\u2019t making much effort to sign them up. Information on a 401(k) may be part of a stack of paper handed out on their first day, that they don\u2019t read or understand, and ultimately set aside and never think about again.

No Republican could have ever seen themselves supporting Hillary Clinton, not with such a vast field of Republican Candidates that were all, with the exception of Donald Trump, vastly superior choices. This is not about convincing people that Clinton is a great option, however, and Lim makes that very clear: \"We're not going to be in the business of convincing people that Hillary Clinton will be the savior of all of our policy issues. We're trying to convince people that your vote has a political and moral purpose, and", "Twenty One Pilots Match A Charting Feat That Only The Beatles And Elvis Have Managed.

The first dog they were introduced to at the Monmouth County SPCA bore a striking resemblance to Reckless. \"Literally when we opened the double doors, the first cage we walk up to I thought 'that looks like Reckless,'\" Chuck James told the Asbury Park Press. \"He was a little heavier and it\u2019s been a little while, but then my wife saw the scar on his head and immediately we start tearing up and we found our dog.\" The dog escaped through a hole in the fence at their Keansburg, N.J., home in October 2012, according to the APP. He had an identification collar on and the family searched for months, but to no avail. Finally, they found him on Thursday, May 1. The animal shelter posted the amazing news on its Facebook page.

A LifeWay Research poll asked 1,001 people if they agreed with the statement, \"I believe the battles in Syria are all part of the prophecies of the Book of Revelation,\" and 32 percent of them said yes. Twenty-six percent agreed with the assertion that \"U.S. military intervention in Syria might lead to the Battle of Armageddon that\u2019s spoken about in the Book of Revelation.\" Gender played a role in responses, as women were more likely than men to draw a corollary between Biblical prophecy and the current situation in Syria. Location and income also skewed the results, with Southerners and members of households making less than $25,000 per year being much more likely to connect Syria with the end of days. In addition, one in five people polled agreed with the statement, \"I believe the world will end in my lifetime.\" The Rev.

Every country competing in the Olympic gymnastic events will send their athletes, their coaches and an envelope of American dollar bills. It's a necessary, if strange, part of the gymnastic rules, which requires $100 to send in an inquiry. The inquiry is essentially the same as a challenge, something common in sports like football and now baseball. Gymnasts can inquire about their routine score before the following score is posted, which makes judges double-check and make sure they received the maximum number of points for their routine. Teams receive the money back if they win the inquiry, but it stays with the IOC if the inquiry is rejected. On Monday, the United States' Laurie Hernandez and France's Marine Boyer both filed inquiries in the Olympics beam event. Boyer was just a tenth behind Simone Biles, who had a bronze finish. The $100 is required to make sure teams don't make capricious challenges, but at the Olympics level, you can imagine teams are happy to risk $100 if it means potential points being added and could be the difference between a medal.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Middle-age white Americans with limited education are increasingly dying younger, on average, than other middle-age U.S. adults, a trend driven by their dwindling economic opportunities, research by two Princeton University economists has found. The economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, argue in a paper released Thursday that the loss of steady middle-income jobs for those with high school degrees or less has triggered broad problems for this group. They are more likely than their college-educated counterparts, for example, to be unemployed, unmarried or afflicted with poor health. \"This is a story of the collapse of the white working class,\" Deaton said in an interview. \"The labor market has very much turned against them.\" Those dynamics helped fuel the rise of President Donald Trump, who won widespread support among whites with only a high school degree. Yet Deaton said his policies are unlikely to reverse these trends, particularly the health care legislation now before the House that Trump is championing. That bill would lead to higher premiums for older Americans, the Congressional Budget Office has found. \"The policies that you see, seem almost perfectly designed to hurt the very people who voted for him,\" Deaton said.

It may help to evaluate your career progression opportunities and find better approaches to help your employees develop skills, earn promotions, and generally grow their careers.

Hewlett-Packard was a business born of and built on innovation. The tech company is among those famous early Silicon Valley businesses founded by a couple of brilliant guys tinkering in a garage.

This week, legislators announced a Tennessee bill to protect freedom of speech on college campuses, known as \"The Milo Bill\" in recognition of his contribution to promoting the First Amendment. Barron\u2019s speech was part of the university\u2019s \u2018All In\u2019 campaign, designed to promote diversity and inclusion on campus, suggesting ideas such as \"specially-designated diversity-related courses\" to increase \"understanding of social justice and equity in the U.S,\" as well as diversity training for the university\u2019s police force.", "Researchers Claim DMT Can Connect You To A Parallel Universe. In Rick Strassman\u2019s book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, he explores the possibility that the vivid, practically tangible realms visited on DMT may actually be our consciousness receiving access to a parallel plain of existence. Similarities in testimonies given by the study volunteers suggest that there may be some validity to this hunch. Each patient experiences their own unique journey with personalized details, however, the overall theme of the reports in juxtaposition was reoccurring: a realm unlike anything of this existence, encounters with intelligent entities, experiences of death and rebirth, unfamiliar sensations, ego disolution, and so on. \"DMT provides regular, repeated, and reliable access to \u2018other\u2019 channels. The other planes of existence are always there. In fact, they are right here, transmitting all the time! But we cannot perceive them because we are not designed to do so; our hard-wiring keeps us tuned in to Channel Normal.\" \u2013 Rick Strassman, M.D. In a correspondence between Strassman and David Deutsch, British scientist and author of The Fabric of Reality, Deutsch expressed doubt in the likeliness of one\u2019s mind actually connecting to a parallel plain of existence as it would require quantum computing. Quantum computing, based on our understanding, requires temperatures near absolute zero", "Are there health benefits to exposing your immune system to bacteria? Answer by Drew Smith, former R&D director at MicroPhage and SomaLogic, on Quora: Beneficial is not quite the word I would use when talking about exposing our immune systems to bacteria. Co-dependent is a bit more accurate. Imagine a tug of war, our immune system on one side and bacteria on the other. Our bodies put just enough energy into our immune systems to ensure that there is an even match - that there is a stable balance between the two sides, what physiologists call homeostasis. Most diseases involve a disruption of homeostasis, either as a cause or a consequence. Because bacteria have always been present in the environment of our ancestors, we've evolved to expect a certain amount of pull from the bacteria on the other side of the rope, and our immune systems are programmed to begin tugging right away. But what happens when one side lets go of the rope? The side that is still pulling collapses in a disorderly heap, and probably gets a few bruises and cuts in the process. So it is with our immune system. It starts pulling, but if no bacteria are pulling back it starts falling all over itself. The result is", "For 70 Years, A Mug In Auschwitz Held A Secret Treasure. From the outside, it looked like any of the other mugs in the Auschwitz museum. But on the inside, this one had a secret \u2014 faithfully kept for seven decades. A false bottom concealed a gold necklace and a gold ring inlaid with stones. The enameled mug was one of more than 12,000 pieces of kitchenware that Nazis stole from people sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp in occupied Poland. \"The Germans incessantly lied to the Jews deported for extermination,\" Dr. Piotr M.A. Cywinski, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, said in a statement. \"They were told about resettlement, work and life in a different location.\" But the Nazis would allow Jews to take only a small amount of luggage. It was a calculated move: If you were going to start a new life, and could only take a small bag, you'd fill it with your most precious possessions. So when a victim arrived at Auschwitz, the Germans could be confident they'd be able to loot their luggage and find valuables. Victims often tried to hide costly possessions from sight. On one hand, Cywinski says, that's proof that Jewish families were well aware that their belongings would be looted during", "Big name actress begins stumping for Hillary Clinton. \"I think Hillary Clinton would make a wonderful president,\" the politically active actress told the magazine. \"I think we could only benefit from having someone in office who has been a mother; women have a different perspective and appreciation of humanity because of that maternal instinct. It can only be a step forward.\" Clinton has yet to confirm whether or not she'll run for the high office, though there's speculation bordering on expectation that she will. Johansson has long supported democratic candidates for office and became particularly close with Barack Obama. The actress went so far as to joke that she was \"engaged\" to Obama in 2008, telling the Associated Press, \"my heart belongs to Barack.\" There was even a mini-controversy that came out of that relationship: Johansson told a reporter that she had emailed with Obama, who later made it clear that he had simply responded to a single email that was forwarded to him. The actress subsequently blamed \"extreme sexism\" for the media attention on the story. Johansson was rumored as a potential candidate to play Clinton in \"Rodham,\" an upcoming biopic, but her representatives threw cool water on the report. She also floated the possibility of entering politics", "Why Margot Robbie Doesn't Like Harley Quinn's Outfits In Suicide Squad. As Margot, no, I don\u2019t like wearing that. I\u2019m eating burgers at lunchtime, and then you go do a scene where you\u2019re hosed down and soaking wet in a white T-shirt, it\u2019s so clingy and you\u2019re self-conscious about it. As comic books are primarily a visual medium, a character\u2019s look is always the most important thing about them. Each hero and villain had to be unique and be able to catch the eye if the creators wanted them to catch on. When these characters make the transition to the movie screen, the look has to go with them, as it has become iconic. Yet, now it isn\u2019t simply an artist\u2019s drawing, but an actual person who has to create that look. Harley Quinn is no different in Suicide Squad . She is colorful and flashy and has an attitude to match. While Margot Robbie understands the need to represent Harley Quinn properly, it doesn\u2019t mean she loves the clothes. They make her more than a little self conscious.Margot Robbie is the subject of a profile in the New York Times which covers her rise to fame through The Wolf of Wall Street as well as her upcoming takeover of the summer,", "This simple trick may solve all your relationship problems. Researchers from the University of Waterloo and University of Michigan set out to investigate whether or not people are actually better at giving advice to others than themselves. To test this, they conducted three studies using University of Michigan students involved in monogamous romantic relationships. The results were recently published in the journal Psychological Science. In the first study, 104 students were told to reflect on a scenario in which they were cheated on or their best friend was cheated on. The scenarios were assigned randomly. Researchers analyzed the responses and found that students who thought about their friend being cheated on scored higher in wise reasoning than students who were told to think about being cheated on themselves. Next, researchers set out to test if there was a way people could exhibit the same wisdom for their own problems as they did during conflicts involving friends. To do this, researchers recruited 120 new students. This time, using the same infidelity scenarios as before, participants were asked to work through the problem from either a first-person perspective using pronouns like \"I\" and \"me\" (\"Why am I feeling this way?\") or a third-person perspective using first names and pronouns like \"he\" and", "Is It Safe To Smoke Marijuana During Pregnancy? You\u2019d Be Surprised Of The Answer. Sounds like something a hit off a joint could fix in a minute, right?  Maybe... but is smoking weed while you\u2019re pregnant really a smart idea? More women than ever seem to think so: A 2019 study found that a growing number of pregnant women are using marijuana recreationally. Do the risks outweigh the benefits? Here\u2019s what to know before you puff away.  Smoking cigarettes while pregnant is a huge no-no. But what about weed? In short: Doctors do not recommend smoking weed while you\u2019re pregnant. Still, many believe the drug is not as unsafe during pregnancy as it seems, while others believe edibles aren\u2019t as harmful as, say, taking a hit of a joint. Basically, there are arguments for the use of weed during pregnancy, but healthcare professionals say it\u2019s a hard pass.  Don\u2019t laugh, but... what is weed, anyway? You might hear some people argue that weed is safe during pregnancy because it\u2019s a natural plant. And that part is true: Marijuana (also known by many nicknames, including weed, pot, and bud) is the dried portion of the Cannabis sativa plant.  Still, just because it\u2019s natural doesn\u2019t make it safe. People smoke weed because it", "Football star comes out as gay. \"I am an openly, proud gay man,\" Sam told ESPN.

It was acquired back in 2009 by the Walt Disney Co. DIS for $4 billion. Many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved Marvel characters like Iron Man and damage Disney's financial standing and stock valuation. Fast forward to 2016, and Disney's acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher. However, it looks like the MCU is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it.

But it now seems that by cutting a small cross in the base of each sprout all this time, we have all simply been doing it wrongly. And instead of boiling them, we should be steaming, stir-frying or even microwaving Brussels to get that perfectly crunchy consistency. Britain\u2019s top sprout expert has urged the nation\u2019s cooks to reconsider their approach to the Christmas staple whose fortunes are starting to be revived. Matthew Rawson, chairman of the Brassica Growers Association, said: \"Boiling them was traditionally the way of doing it, but putting the cross in puts in too much water. \"They turn soggy and rubbish. People who do that have ruined the Brussels sprout.\" Mr Rawson, who farms in Yorkshire, added: \"People now are learning that it is a very versatile vegetable. The big ones lend themselves well to a stir-fry. People are steaming them, and there are fancy microwave packs. It is being driven forward by people who are more creative.\" He credits the new vogue for dishes such as Brussels sprouts with pancetta and chestnuts or pistachio and pomegranate sprout salad with revitalising the vegetable\u2019s fortunes. \"Brussels sprouts have moved away from the poor little malign Christmas sprout image, and", "@JulieChen reveals painful secret.

Researchers found associations between doctor job satisfaction and electronic health records. Among doctors' biggest worries about e-health records were that they would interfere with face-to-face patient interaction and increase clerical work by doctors. Doctors also reported concern about the accuracy of medical reports, because of the template design of some e-health record systems. \"Physicians believe in the benefits of electronic health records, and most do not want to go back to paper charts,\" Friedberg said in the statement. \"But at the same time, they report that electronic systems are deeply problematic in several ways.

There isn\u2019t a whole lot of scientific research effort directed at understanding the pain of paper cuts, probably because nobody would sign up for a randomised, controlled study that involved a researcher intentionally inflicting this kind of torture on study participants. But according to Dr. Hayley Goldbach , a resident physician in dermatology at UCLA, \"we can use our knowledge of human anatomy to help us out here. It\u2019s all a question of anatomy\". It\u2019s all to do with nerve endings. To start with, there are lots more pain receptors embedded in your fingertips than almost anywhere else in your body. Though Goldbach is quick to point out, \"it would probably also hurt a lot if you got a paper cut on your face or in your genitals, if you can imagine that.\" So while a paper cut on your arm, or thigh, or ankle might still be annoying, it would probably be more trivial than the intense fiery quality that finger-based paper cuts tend to have. \ue11f The cuts from paper aren't deep, but they can be extremely painful (Credit: iStock) You can actually prove this to yourself by employing a test that psychologists and neurologists use.

One of the earliest writers to debunk the \"fascist club\" claim was the National Review\u2019s Ed Whelan. \"I am reliably informed that no such club ever existed and that there was instead an inside joke among friends in the senior class that parodied political debates happening at the school,\" Whelan wrote in his Bench Memos blog. \"A contemporary of Gorsuch\u2019s at the school also tells me that yearbook editors added stuff to student blurbs without their permission.\" \"Earth to newspaper reporters: High-school yearbook editors sometimes have a sophomoric sense of humor,\" Whelan added.

When McCarthy's cover debuted last week, critics were quick to point out that the other November cover girls, including Penelope Cruz and Reese Witherspoon, were all styled in body-conscious outfits that flashed some skin. McCarthy, on the other hand, was dressed in a coat \"so huge,\" wrote Slate, \"that she could hide her Mike and Molly co-star Billy Gardel underneath.\" Today, Elle has responded to the critics, defending its styling choices with the following statement: \"On all of our shoots, our stylists work with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no different: Melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover. We are thrilled to honor her as one of our Women in Hollywood this year.\" Fashion magazines have long been accused of treating their curvier cover models differently than their stick-thin celeb cover girls.

It was part of a three-year, $24 million plan that school officials called the \"Digital Renaissance.\" But school officials decided to stop using Apple devices last month. Instead, students will be given Lenovo Chromebooks. The reason was simple: Cost. Each Chromebooks costs about $200, 75 percent less than a MacBook, according to school board documents.

One-third of American adults are now classified as obese (30 pounds or more over the recommended body weight for their height, age and sex) with another one-third considered to be overweight. To put it another way, just one-third of American adults are considered to be of a healthy weight. While I agree with the Sugar Association's Dr. Charles Baker in his recent blog that we should approach the obesity epidemic armed with knowledge, it appears the only thing the Sugar Association wants to do is exonerate its product and cast blame on other sweeteners, especially high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). We've seen before how detrimental it is to the overall goal of eliminating obesity to blame one ingredient -- at various times, it was carbohydrates or certain kinds of fats. The fact is, there is not one ingredient to blame for the obesity epidemic. Demonizing one sweetener does not give consumers the information they need to make informed dietary decisions.

Sciatica pain is a common issue, manifested by pain, tingling, weakness, and numbness of the lower limbs, and due to these signs, it may often be mistaken for leg cramps or lower back pain. At times, it may lead to numbness and mild ache, but sometimes it causes almost unbearable, sharp, burning sensation in one side of the body.

However, not all ethnic groups are enjoying this improved survival,\" Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told HealthDay . Breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34 percent since 1990 in all racial/ethnic groups except American Indians/Alaska Natives, while African-American women continue to have the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial/ethnic group.

All the nasty junk you orally introduced to your body when you sucked your thumb may have actually acclimated your immune system to handle microbial organisms. That exposure reduced your risk of developing allergies later in life, according to the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Study, a New Zealand-based study that followed the lives of 1,037 subjects, born in 1972 and 1973, into adulthood. When the subjects were 13 years old, the researchers found that children who either bit their nails or sucked their thumbs had a 38% rate of atopic sensitization, or reaction to an allergen via a skin-prick test, compared to the 49% rate of sensitization in children who did neither. When the subjects were tested again at age 32, the reactions were the same. The study even showed that children who sucked their thumbs and bit their fingernails had a 31% lower risk of adult allergies, compared to the 38% of children who did one or the other, according to the study's lead author Bob Hancox from the University of Otago. The results don't indicate an allergy cure-all. The study didn't find any associations between thumb-sucking and reducing asthma or hayfever, and the researchers don't even suggest parents encourage their children", "\"True Blood\" star axed from latest \"X-Men\". As first reported by Entertainment Weekly, the \"True Blood\" star's mutant persona, Rogue, was left on the cutting room floor. Director Bryan Singer revealed that he had axed a rescue scene involving Magneto, Professor X, Iceman and -- you guessed it -- Rogue, from the final film. Unfortunately for Paquin, this was only scene that included her character. Singer explained the situation to EW.com: \"It\u2019s a really good sequence and it will probably end up on the DVD so people can see it. But like many things in the editing process, it was an embarrassment of riches and it was just one of the things that had to go ... Even though she\u2019s in the materials and part of the process of making the film, she won\u2019t appear in it.\" Singer explained that the cut had nothing to do with Paquin's acting, and that he would love to work with her in the future. Like a gentleman, Singer has already informed Paquin of the situation and says she \"completely understood.\" According to HitFix, however. there's still a chance Paquin could end up seeing some screen time after the film's upcoming reshoots.", "FOIE GRAS: WHERE IS IT ACTUALLY BANNED? The ban is expected to hit French exports of the fatty duck or goose liver hard: France currently exports 20,000 tons a year, mainly to Europe, the USA and China, and is a member of the European Foie Gras Foundation, along with Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary and Spain. What is foie gras? Foie gras is the fatty livers of a ducks or geese that have often been forcibly overfed via tubing inserted into the oesophagus, a process known as 'gavage'. This causes their livers to swell to roughly 10 times the original size. Many view gavage as extremely unethical and unneccessarily cruel, so much so that the production of foie gras is actually banned in many countries \u2013 but only India has implemented a total ban. Below we\u2019ve compiled a list of countries and places showing exactly where they stand on the production and sale of the luxury food, and also where bans have been overturned.

More precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other.

You can book a stay in the fort, which is described as a \"bare bones hostel\" with a major \"lack of modern life.\" It's a sunny island paradise by day, but so dark at night that you'll need to bring a sleeping bag for warmth and a torch for light.

When the assistant coach Billy Donlon\u2019s turn came, he made his snip, retreated down the ladder and handed off the scissors to his fellow assistant Jeff Meyer \u2014 gripping the blades and offering the handle, the way he and everyone else were taught in kindergarten. But when Donlon looked down moments later, he recalled last week, he saw his palm covered in blood.

The new protocol, which will be rolled out in Germany first, is simple; new tools for users will allow them to flag links as potential fake news. This will prompt an independent fact-checking organisation, Correctiv, to verify the article's veracity. If they deem to it to be fake news, then the link is given a 'disputed' badge and shunted down to the bottom of your newsfeed. It's a clever, pragmatic solution that will have an immediate impact on fake news, which is important given that Germany has an election coming up. But I can see potential flashpoints with Facebook's new tools that might blunt their effectiveness. Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg The disputed badge will become a badge of honour The Facebook pages that spread fake news and the people that share it revel in being anti-establishment. If their posts are routinely flagged with 'disputed' then they'll wear that as a badge of honour.

Ever peeped an article about Diet Coke causing cancer and/or multiple sclerosis? You probably have. However, as explained in the Outline's detailed rebuttal, these claims are thus far \"full of shit.\" Initial concern regarding an increase in various types of cancers actually began eight years before aspartame was introduced to consumers, with additional testing showing no causal relationship between the sweetener and cancer. As for MS fears, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society says there's currently \"no scientific evidence\" supporting claims of aspartame causing the chronic disease. The same goes for claims of Diet Coke causing depression, claims which arguably peaked upon publication of a 2013 study by the American Academy of Neurology. The study, which the Outline describes as \"an example of correlation and causation gone horribly awry,\" found that 4.3 percent of participants reported being diagnosed and treated for depression within a 10-year period. That study, as noted by the British Dietetic Association's Gaynor Bussell to BBC News at the time, was a \"one-off\" and should not be viewed as proof that such sweeteners cause depression.

If you're as young and bored as I am, though, you might wonder: Could you pull it off? Could you actually check everything off the BuzzFeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? A little while ago, I set out to find out for myself. Here's how I did it: First, I had to compile all of the lists BuzzFeed has published in its \"Before You Die\" format. At the time I filed this story, there were 182 lists. These ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to South Africa's version of Burning Man). BuzzFeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing Aussie burgers or the ten best New Orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in London. Next, I cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists. There are over a thousand individual tasks. On Motherboard: Counting the Hours I've Spent on the Internet Next, I calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks. This is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take", "8 amazing beauty products you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d known about sooner.

Especially people who often find themselves \u2018accidentally\u2019 drinking a bottle of wine and then \u2018forgetting\u2019 to take their make-up off before bed, but still want to look as dewy as a Snapchat filter the next day. It\u2019s a known fact that plants and minerals from Iceland are the result of witchcraft, and the ~glacial water~, fatty-acids, and yeast extract in this light lotion definitely seem to have supernatural powers. Somewhere between a balm and a serum, I like to put it on before moisturiser for a bit of a skin-detox boost, and because it contains aloe and other cooling ingredients, you feel a blast of freshness like you\u2019re standing on the edge of Gulfoss.

California, home to the largest number of American Indians in the country, is for the third time considering legislation that would end the use of \"Redskins\" as a school team name or mascot. If the legislation passes and is signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, California would become the first state in the nation to ban the use of \"Redskins\" as a team name or mascot in public schools, according to the Washington, D.C.-based National Congress of American Indians, founded in 1944. Many Native Americans consider the term a racial slur. The bill is the latest effort in a more than 50-year national campaign by Native Americans to remove race-based team names from schools and sports groups. In California, proponents of the ban have cited peer-reviewed studies by researchers at the University of Arizona, Stanford University and the University of Michigan that found American Indian youth who were exposed to Native American mascots and stereotypical imagery reported a diminished sense of what they could achieve academically. Cindy La Marr, executive director of the Sacramento-based nonprofit organization Capitol Area Indian Resources, said the harm of stereotypical racial mascots is compounded because there is a widespread lack of knowledge about the modern-day lives of", "Why Women Really Leave The Men They Love. As a marriage counselor working with men and women in relationship crisis, I help clients navigate numerous issues. While many situations are complex, there's one profoundly simple truth that men need to know: Women leave men they love. They feel terrible about it. It tears their heart out. But they do it. They rally their courage and their resources and they leave. Women leave men with whom they have children, homes and lives. Women leave for many reasons, but there's one reason in particular that haunts me, one that I want men to understand: Women leave because their man is not present. He's working, golfing, gaming, watching TV, fishing ... the list is long. These aren't bad men. They're good men. They're good fathers. They support their family. They're nice, likeable. But they take their wife for granted. They're not present. Women in my office tell me, \"Someone could come and sweep me off my feet, right out from under my husband.\" Sometimes the realization scares them. Sometimes it makes them cry. Men, I'm not saying this is right or wrong. I'm telling you what I see. You can get as angry, hurt or indignant as you want.

The dark secret in your glass of sunshine. When fruit is stripped of its skin, pulp, flesh and other fibrous parts, it's distilled down to its sweet essence. That means that orange juice has roughly the same amount of sugar as the demon of the nutritional world, soda -- about 5 to 8 teaspoons per cup. Add to this: the sugar in pure, natural juice and the sugar in sugar-sweetened beverages are both densely packed with calories, say Naveed Sattar, MD, PhD, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow. In a recent article in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal, Sattar points out that eating whole fruit is associated with a reduced (or neutral) risk of diabetes, but drinking fruit juice is associated with an increased risk. 2. The cold truth. The marquee vitamin in orange juice, vitamin C, is good for your immune system, and it's an antioxidant that protects cells from free radicals. But some of its benefits are overrated: No studies have been able to conclude that vitamin C helps cure colds.

Recently, I've seen a rise in the number of people on my Facebook feed writing or posting long articles about why social media is destructive to teenagers. Many people seem to have a negative outlook on social media and its influence on today's youth. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of negative aspects of kids having so much freedom on the Internet in this day and age. Advertisers have endless opportunities to manipulate and influence us. Privacy is not really an option for most social media users. Plus, the Internet is now an environment that allows people to easily and anonymously hurt others. Cyber bullying has become a huge problem in the last few years. These are all negative aspects of being a part of online communities. That being said, I don't think social media is totally bad. I actually think being part of the social media world is beneficial to teenagers. It provides a space for youth to share opinions, stories and thoughts. It allows us to connect with people all over the world. It can be used for bad things, but it can also be used for good.

And when the FBI opened an investigation into the server, Clinton called the FBI looking into server nothing but a \"security inquiry.\" FBI Director James Comey has responded to Clinton's comments, via Fox News. And she won't like what he has to say: But when asked Wednesday by Fox News about Clinton's characterization of the bureau's probe, FBI Director James Comey said he doesn\u2019t know what \"security inquiry\" means \u2014 adding, \"We\u2019re conducting an investigation. ...

There are many theories about why cats knead their paws into you, but many researchers agree that they\u2019re trying to return the affection that you\u2019re showing them. They just don\u2019t know that it actually hurts. 2.

More than half of 2,700 adults surveyed for Ameriprise Financial late last year expect to get an inheritance of more than $100,000. Among those who had already received an inheritance, about the same percentage (52 percent) got less than $100,000. The survey focused on Americans between the ages of 25 and 70 with at least $25,000 in assets. Some 83 percent plan to leave money to loved ones. If those heirs have unrealistic expectations, it can lead to family tension later, said Marcy Keckler, vice president for financial advice strategy at Ameriprise.  Half of the boomers surveyed plan to leave at least $500,000 to their kids. Forty-seven percent of Gen Xers and 33 percent of millennials wanted to leave that much as well. While the survey found that the majority of those who had already inherited got less than $100,000, perhaps the portfolios of those benefactors hadn't lived through an eight-year bull market. Family conflicts often arise when money mixes with grief. Almost a quarter of those surveyed expect family members will have disagreements after they learn the terms of the will.

Not only do we not usually read them, most of the time we don't even open that attachment or give cover letters a cursory glance. It's such a waste of time. Many companies have even stopped asking for them altogether. But I'll tell you who does read cover letters: hiring managers. Not all. In fact, a lot don't, but in the entire hiring equation, were I to assign likelihood, a hiring manager is more prone to read the cover letter than anyone else involved.

For the past couple of years, horror gaming fans have been able to look forward to one new entry in the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s series after another, with four core games, one RPG spinoff, and a novel released so far. The next game in the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location, was scheduled to release this coming Friday, October 7th, but if developer Scott Cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months. According to a post by Cawthon on the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location Steam page, the game is being delayed because it\u2019s too dark. Cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely \"into something kid-friendly.\" Delays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it\u2019s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release.

After my tween and teen years I thought I got off with nary a breakout. Then suddenly I'm in my mid-twenties, a working professional, and I'm hiding behind red lipstick and concealer. Pimples aren't a good look on anyone, but they feel even bigger, more obtrusive and debilitating when you're an adult. And the worst part is that there is no cure.

Evans first donned Captain America\u2019s suit and carried the comic book character\u2019s shield in 2011\u2019s Captain America: The First Avenger.

The three-year-old Border Collie chewed on some plants as the family took a walk through the Horsetooth Reservoir. Shortly after the walk, the dog didn't look well. He was taken to the vet. According to the vet, the plant the dog was chewing on was deadly water hemlock. In July, the plant thrives in wetlands, marshes and river banks across America, blooming with tiny clusters of white flowers. A few bites of the plant can kill a large dog in less than two hours. A dog poisoned with water hemlock may first appear nervous and pupils will dilate. This will progress to twitching, drooling, convulsions and seizures. If a tiny amount was eaten and dogs survive the toxic effects, they are often left with permanent heart or skeletal muscle damage. If dogs eat too much and don't get medical help quickly, this can be followed by respiratory paralysis and death.

Scientists say Mars and the Earth \u2018almost certainly\u2019 seeded each other with life billions of years ago when both planets were battered with huge asteroid strikes - sending fragments of them both into space.

Photo credit: Almay Here at The Huffington Post we spend a lot of time coming up with ways to waste less food, spend less money on groceries and eat better meals. There are many tools in our toolbox to make this all possible, and today we're going to talk about one more: the FIFO method of sorting your groceries. FIFO stands for first in, first out. It's a method used in accounting, and, wait for it, at the grocery store. When the supermarket gets fresh milk in stock, for example, they place the older stuff in front and the newer stuff behind it. This ensures that the consumer will purchase the older product first, before it spoils and they have to throw it out. It's a simple concept, but an effective one. Here's what you need to do with that information: use this method at home. Putting away the groceries can sometimes feel like the worst part of this essential kitchen chore, so it's understandable if you just shove the groceries into the fridge without a second thought. We get it, but stop. Instead, move all the perishable older goods to the front and place the newer groceries behind them. This", "Looking for a job that doesn\u2019t stress you out? Here are the best ones in 2017:. CareerCast evaluated 200 professions and rated them on 11 measures of stress, such as the amount of travel required, the growth potential of the industry and job, and the physical demands of the role. The report isn't a survey CareerCast relies largely on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to score every position on each metric, and then rolls that up into an overall stress score. More methodology details are available here. To see the 10 least stressful jobs and their median salaries, view the gallery below. Although these jobs are rated as low-stress based on CareerCast's approach, by no means are they easy or unimportant. Some, such as audiologist and tenured professor, require a Ph.D. Others, like medical and pharmacy technicians, provide critical support in the process of saving lives. CareerCast's stress ratings are averages, and exceptions always arise. For instance, having a difficult manager or extremely demanding clients can make any job unpleasant. Also, much stress is self-induced and best managed by means other than switching jobs, like limiting the number of tasks you take on.

The unusual thing about this snake battle royale, however, isn't that Kelly managed to record it unscathed, but that the two snakes, a copperhead and a cottonmouth, shouldn't have been fighting at all. According to Alabama Auburn University herpetologist David Steen, male snakes often fight in something called a \"combat dance\" over female snakes. But until now, no one has recorded evidence of two different species of male snakes fighting, according to the BBC. When snakes wrestle, it's not to the death but to overpower the weaker snake and eventually mate with the female snake waiting for the winner nearby. But if the female snake is of a different species, this sort of a sparring match seems like a wasted effort since snakes can only mate with their own kind. The video shows the two male snakes battling, and there's no female snake or snakes captured in the footage. So it's ultimately unclear whether the male snakes were indeed fighting to impress female snakes off camera.

Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report\u2019s authors warn. Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called \u2018superbugs\u2019 such as MRSA develop.

Twilight hype died Lautner's Twilight co-stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were clever with their careers. While still attached to the franchise, they both starred in other films, like Adventureland (2009) and Water For Elephants (2011). As a result, the duo had an easier time transitioning to other roles post-Twilight. Lautner, however, had only a bit part in Valentine's Day (2010) to tide him over until the franchise was over. A source told The Hollywood Reporter, \"It's not easy to move out of the shadow of a hit like Twilight. But he's still very young. There's time for Taylor to become more than just Jacob.\" Unfortunately, it may be too late now for Lautner to escape the shadow of the supernatural drama. His first star vehicle bombed Lautner was the marquee name in 2011's Abduction, and the movie didn't do well at all. The film was critically panned, earning a measly Metascore of 25 and only scored four percent on Rotten Tomatoes. That wouldn't be so bad if the box office numbers were better, but it only made $28 million domestically, not even breaking even on its $35 million budget.

As we move towards the second half of 2016, it's shaping out to be one of the safest years in recent aviation history. \"We are ahead of the 10-year average with eight accidents and 167 fatalities compared to the average of 10 accidents and 205 fatalities,\" aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas, editor of Airlineratings.com , told CNN. Analyzing the data Experts say measuring the number of crashes or deaths alone isn't an accurate way to determine safety. You also have to factor in the overall amount of aviation traffic. It cites Aviation-Safety.net data that tallies 16 air accidents with 560 fatalities -- below the 10-year average and an improvement on 2014 when there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities. \"Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5% of today's number,\" said the report.

In celebration of Glamour's 75th anniversary and Beverly's storied career, the glossy tapped model Arlenis Sosa to interview Ms. Johnson, aka \"The Model Who Changed Everything,\" for its November issue. The 60-year-old stunner chats about how she landed her first cover (a typing test was involved), what she thinks about the modeling world today and paving the way for other models of color. Frankly, without Beverly, who many consider to be the first black supermodel, there may have never been a Naomi, an Iman or a Tyra. In fact, Beverly revealed to Glamour that she used to transport those ladies to some of their photo shoots. \"I remember driving Naomi Campbell to jobs, and Tyra Banks, and even Iman when she first came from Africa.\" Wow! We would have loved to be part of that carpool situation. Although the lack of diversity on the runway has been a hot topic, Beverly believes that things have gotten better over the years. \"It\u2019s wonderful to see so much more ethnic diversity now, which didn\u2019t exist when I was modeling,\" she said. Iman and Naomi wouldn't agree with that, but one thing they might agree on is the lack of hairstylists and makeup artists", "There's a fish running for city council in this state. Just take a look at one of the candidates for city council -- it goes by the name Twenty Pound Carp. Last November, the Michigan fish made a name for itself when it was removed from West Park for being \"destructive\" to the pond's vegetation. At the time, the 20-pound carp was relocated to a nearby river. But it seems he had greater aspirations.

And in order to determine the one true hero of them all\u2014the one most vital to the story, with the most important connections to other characters\u2014we must turn to math. Andrew J. Beveridge, an associate professor of mathematics at Macalester College, and Jie Shan, an intrepid undergraduate, decided to turn the world of the Game of Thrones books into a social network using network science, a branch of applied graph theory that draws from several disciplines, including economics, sociology, and, computer science, to examine how information flows from one thing to another. The books and HBO fantasy series, with their massive cast of characters, various shifting allegiances, and intricate relationship dynamics, were a perfect fit to be studied mathematically. \"This is a fanciful application of network science,\" Beveridge told Quartz. \"But it\u2019s the kind of accessible application that shows what mathematics is all about, which is finding and explaining patterns.\" Their research, entitled \"Network of Thrones,\" is published in the Mathematical Association of America\u2019s publication, Math Horizons (pdf).

Here's the rub: By suggesting users only connect with people they already know, LinkedIn is actually doing the opposite of what makes the platform so powerful - the depth and breadth of your connection list. Put simply, the more people you are connected to on LinkedIn, the more visibility and reach you have on the platform. Show Up and Stand Out Here's just one example: With 433 million members in 200 countries, LinkedIn has one of the planet's most powerful internal search engines. And the more people you're connected to on LinkedIn, the better chance your profile has of showing up high on searches related to the products or services you provide. (Note: If you haven't already, now would be a good time to make sure you have the key ingredients of creating a killer LinkedIn profile in place!) Think about it this way: If a Small Business Owner (let's call him \"John Doe\") hops on LinkedIn because he need to find a CPA in Chicago, John is likely to type \"CPA Chicago\" into the LinkedIn Search bar to see what results come up.

Ross explained that her re\u0301sume\u0301 may look eclectic, but the thread running through it is that each job she took allowed her to be true to her identity as a creator and to simultaneously offer and extract value. Before taking a new job, she asked herself two questions: \"What am I going to learn?\" and \"Are they going to use me for what I do best?\" These two questions allow anyone to avoid what Ross considers to be the traps of five-year plans, which she believes are especially troublesome for 20-somethings beginning their careers.

The iconic image of the Christian cross tends to feature a central vertical beam transected by a perpendicular beam about a third of the way down. This version of the cross is visible everywhere from emoji (which include both the two-beam Latin cross and the Orthodox cross, also known as the Suppedaneum cross, which has another bar near the bottom) to roadside memorials and, of course, church steeples. But the actual crosses Romans used for executions probably took a different shape. The Greek and Latin words for \"cross\" \u2014 \"stauros\" and \"crux\" \u2014 do not necessarily describe what most people imagine as a cross. They refer to an upright stake upon which the condemned could be bound with hands above their heads. Most historians surmise that Jesus\u2019 cross was more likely to have been T-shaped, with the vertical element notched to allow executioners to tie the victim to the crossbeam, then raise it and set it securely into the top.

The photograph in question was taken on US President Donald Trump's first day in the Oval Office on Monday, when he signed a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions. \"Men making decisions about women's bodies\" was a much-repeated phrase on Twitter, as it was shared hundreds of thousands of times, including by author JK Rowling. The concern over lack of women at the table comes as Mr Trump's cabinet attracts attention for the high proportion of white, male nominations. And while some people welcomed the move on abortion, others on social media expressed alarm and confusion over what its impact could be. Viral images and headlines do not always tell the whole story. So here is an at-a-glance look at what President Trump's executive order means. Is this a step towards banning abortion in the US? Not in itself. This particular executive order is relevant outside of US borders. The policy requires non-governmental organisations receiving federal funding to agree to \"neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations\". This particularly worries women's rights campaigners in developing countries, where funds or facilities are already limited.

As John Adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was \"the sublimest Thing ever exhibited in America.\" But while Adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasn't until four years later that the principle was put to the test. After all, George Washington didn't want to run again for the 1796 election and Adams kept power within the same party.

Fred Trump, Donald\u2019s father, made his money building modest apartments for lower- and middle-income people in Brooklyn and Queens with subsidized loans from the Federal Housing Administration. But, as the younger Mr. Trump wrote in \"The Art of the Deal,\" nobody was doing that by the 1980s because \"it\u2019s not profitable and government subsidies have been eliminated.\" So the younger Mr. Trump shifted toward higher-profile projects in Manhattan, which also depended on government assistance in the form of tax abatements. His earliest major construction deal in Manhattan was the redevelopment of the Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal, now the glass-covered Grand Hyatt. Mr. Trump sought and won a 40-year property tax abatement (one so long it is still in place today) over the objections of other hotel operators. Before that, he helped persuade the city to build the Jacob K.

Despite concerns that Trump does not have any relevant political experience (or any experience at all), he has managed to keep the public and the media\u2019s attention long enough to make his voice heard. Word on the street is that if Donald does secure the GOP nomination (which seems likely), he will likely have a good chance of becoming President Trump. Trump has appealed to conservative audiences (and possibly even shocked some of them) with his ideas, the most prominent of which are a repeal of Obamacare and stricter immigration policies. An America with Trump for president would also have stricter foreign policies towards ISIS, as shown by the Vice.com article in which Trump promises to \"cut the head off of ISIS and steal their oil.\" The move is definitely surprising given that Christie and Trump were having a battle of wits not that long ago.

Thune's request for more information about how Trending Topics works, and look forward to addressing his questions.\" It remains to be seen just how forthcoming Facebook will be. In its role as a quasi-journalistic publisher of information, the company may shirk at the prospect of handing over information about its editorial processes. \"Facebook is free to reveal what information it chooses about its decision-making process and to defend its editorial process as it chooses,\" First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams told CNNMoney.", "This Man Actually Caught All US Pokemon And He\u2019s Now Telling Us His Secret!

As uncovered by Buzzfeed over the weekend, Pence wrote an op-ed in 1999 after seeing Disney\u2019s Mulan with his children, and the article ran on a website for the talk radio show he hosted at the time. Buzzfeed has republished the text in full along with a screenshot of the editorial. Here are some excerpts: Mulan is a fictional account of a delicate girl of the same name who surreptitiously takes her fathers place in the Chinese army in one of their ancient wars against the Huns. Despite her delicate features and voice, Disney expects us to believe that Mulan\u2019s ingenuity and courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal basis with her cloddish cohorts. Obviously, this is Walt Disney\u2019s attempt to add childhood expectation to the cultural debate over the role of women in the military. I suspect that some mischievous liberal at Disney assumes that Mulan\u2019s story will cause a quiet change in the next generation\u2019s attitude about women in combat and they just might be right. (Just think about how often we think of Bambi every time the subject of deer hunting comes into the mainstream media debate.)

It quickly created a stir on campus, and soon after there were calls from students for the statue to go, but the school says \"Sleepwalker\" is going to stay put for the semester.

Well, they could if they had any. But, aside from the 10 American giants, there\u2019s currently only one big carrier in the whole world that can handle such a job \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t belong to Britain, Russia or even China. It\u2019s the Charles de Gaulle, the flagship and pride of the French Navy, and it\u2019s been sent several times to join the fight against the Islamic State in Syria and in Libya. The carrier\u2019s strike group performed so well in pounding the militants in the region that the United States Navy awarded it a Meritorious Unit Commendation in June.

John Tiffany Jo Rowling was incredibly generous.

It was only after the first book came out that I realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours.

But Gardner's concern isn't simply with the legal ins and outs of recreational marijuana. What he really wants to know is if this DOJ decision sets a new precedent for states to opt out of other federal laws -- like President Obama's signature health care package, the Affordable Care Act. Gardner writes: I write to question the Department\u2019s constitutional authority on overriding federal law and seek answers as to whether this action sets precedent to allow states to opt out of other federal laws. While I commend the DOJ for finally issuing guidance after nearly ten months since Colorado voters legalized marijuana\u2019s recreation use, its new policies are in contrast to the Controlled Substances Act. Essentially, DOJ policy now allows states like Colorado to opt out of federal marijuana laws. Do you believe the DOJ has the authority to override federal law? Do you believe you have the authority to change law without the approval of Congress? Colorado and Washington voters approved the use of recreational marijuana for adults 21-and-over last November. Last week in a joint phone call, Holder told the governors that the DOJ would take a \"trust but verify approach\" to the state laws.

Now some skeptics might point out that there are also a lot of characters who don't have any parents at all \u2013 like in Aladdin. But even in those films, there are side characters who have a father and no mother. Recall Jasmine's dad the Sultan? No wifey. Well if you've been trying to think of a reason behind this common plot structure, look no further. Because longtime Disney producer Don Hahn recently offered two very insightful theories behind Walt's method. And one theory behind it is quite sad! Don explained that the lack of parents in the films is just an easy way to allow the main characters to grow up. And let's face it \u2013 most Disney movies are about growing up.  \"One reason is practical because the movies are 80 or 90 minutes long, and Disney films are about growing up\" says Hahn. \"Bambi's mother gets killed, so he has to grow up. Belle only has a father, but he gets lost, so she has to step into that position. It's a story shorthand.\" Hahn went on to explain that this isn't", "This Puppy Just Howled For The First Time!

For the ultimate fan (maybe one who read all of our favorite Leonard books), what better way to remember Leonard than by purchasing his $2.399 million dollar estate in Bloomfield, Mich.? A writer could find inspiration sitting in the study where he wrote his novels, and a writer on a budget might find inspiration just by looking at photos of where Leonard lived and worked. \"His jeans are all lined up, his shoes are all perfect,\" Hall & Hunter Realty Listing Agent Lanie Hardy said of the storage space in the sprawling master suite. \"I've never seen a closet so organized.\" The home offers an insight into Leonard's mind, she thinks: fun-loving, yet meticulous and methodical.

In fact, they can become so sad and emotional that they suffer \u2018post-coital dysphoria\u2019 (PCD), according to a report. Until now it was assumed only women suffer PCD, with nearly half reporting feelings of sadness, anxiety and tearfulness at some point.  But in recent years doctors have heard complaints from male patients that they can go into deep depression and feel achy and irritable for hours after sex. The report\u2019s author, Professor Robert Schweitzer, of Queensland University of Technology in Australia, has studied data from both genders, and says PCD is \u2018not uncommon\u2019 in men.

This Is Incredible. When you don't get enough sleep, your mind and body will inevitably suffer the consequences. There is a plethora of information in textbooks and on the Internet that will tell you again and again about the repercussions of sleep deprivation, and most of us are very well aware of them. So, instead of telling you what you already know, let's talk about something that most people should be doing on top of getting regular sleep: taking naps. That's right - the activity that is often associated with laziness is actually highly beneficial to you. Aside from how enjoyable they are, there are real mental and physical advantages to incorporating them into your regular routine. 1.

It is the first chief executive election since Hong Kong was brought to a standstill by mass pro-democracy rallies in 2014. Protesters wanted fully democratic elections for their leader - but Beijing refused. Pro-democracy campaigner Joshua Wong has called the current electoral process \"a selection rather than an election\". In a nutshell: What is happening? A small group of mainly pro-Beijing electors will choose from three candidates to succeed outgoing leader CY Leung. His deputy, Carrie Lam, is Beijing's choice for the top job. But her main rival, former finance chief John Tsang, is the public's favourite, according to opinion polls. The pro-democracy camp are backing Mr Tsang in a likely unsuccessful bid to keep Ms Lam out. The third candidate is retired judge Woo Kwok-hing. So who does get to vote? Ordinary Hong Kong people have no say. Instead, Hong Kong's 1,200-seat Election Committee, a mostly pro-Beijing body, will decide on the next leader. The Legislative Council's 70 members - half of whom are directly elected - form part of this committee. But most of the members are elected by business, professional or special interest groups. Critics say entities that lean towards Beijing are given disproportionately large representation. In the", "Players discover major change in Pokemon Go after hitting level 20. Poke\u0301mon GO players have been leveling up steadily since the game\u2019s release, and it appears that there is currently a level cap of 40 in the popular mobile game. Each level provides a handful of rewards based on which level you have achieved, but it appears that\u2019s not the only thing higher players are receiving. Despite the advantage of acquiring higher level Poke\u0301mon in the wild and through evolution, there is something quite annoying that players over level 20 are having to encounter on a frequent basis. It looks like the game is making everything more difficult to catch, including those pesky low level Pidgeys and Rattatas. It seems that these pocket monsters are starting to master the art of breaking out of Poke\u0301 Balls; I guess they didn\u2019t get the memo that the game is not necessarily a catch and release sport.

AUSTIN - An Austin couple who stopped to pick up a meal at an IHOP restaurant early Monday said they will never go to another IHOP after the message they saw on their receipt. Arainia Brown and her boyfriend Rolman Sparkman were traveling back to Austin and decided to grab a to-go order from the IHOP at I-35 and Cesar Chavez around 3 a.m. Monday. When Brown saw her receipt, she immediately became upset. \"This is not a joke,\" said Sparkman. \"It's very serious and it hurt a lot of people's feelings.\" Brown and Sparkmen were shocked to see \"BLACK PPL\" typed at the top of their receipt. Two words that induced a range of emotions. \"I feel upset, I'm sad, I'm angry. Like this, it makes no sense,\" said Brown. Adding insult to injury, Brown said the server was a young Black man. \"You could have asked me my name,\" said Brown. \"Don't put, don't label me.

Naturally, this lead to someone bringing up Jennifer Aniston's nipples on Friends, which I only discovered were a 'thing'. I'd caught on to them over the years, but I never made a compilation and put it on YouTube, you know what I mean? I just put it down to a cold studio atmosphere. And then I remembered this one time from when I was a kid. Me, my mate and his bro were sat inside one Saturday on a grub break watching Friends. I don't recall the episode or particular scene, but it must have been one where Aniston's nips were having it large, cause it provoked my mate's bro to say: 'You know why you can always see Jennifer Aniston's nipples in Friends?' 'Nah, why?' we asked. 'She cut holes in her bra so her boobs could look good but natural' or something along those lines. Possibly more crass. As a result, I've had the great misfortune of looking at videos of Jennifer Aniston's boobs this afternoon and I've gotta say, I think my mate's bro was onto something.

For most, the answer would be to tap the home button and start closing apps, like so: But according to Refinery29, most people would be wrong. They have dug out advice from the experts, and have found that when you close apps, you aren't necessarily saving battery as the act of opening them back up again requires extra effort. That means it can actually be more difficult than if you had just left them running. Instead, it's best to go to settings, general and tap on background app refresh to see which apps are in the background draining your battery life. You can switch the setting off entirely to save power, or switch off individual apps. Problem solved, thank us later.", "Mystery solved: Why do swimmers wear two caps? As you\u2019re watching Katie Ledecky Michael Phelps and the rest of America\u2019s aquatic Olympians carving through the pool, you might notice that at the end of their races, they peel off one cap only to reveal another beneath. What the heck? What\u2019s going on there? How many caps do they have hidden, one under the other? Swimmers wear two caps for two main reasons: stability and speed. ( We discussed this very topic four years ago , but it\u2019s cool if you don\u2019t recall.) Many swimmers wear their goggles over one swim cap but under another; the lower swim cap can wrinkle and create drag. The lower cap is generally a latex material, which stays on the head better but wrinkles more, while the upper cap is a silicon material. In a sport where hundredths of a second matter, every tiny bit of drag can be the difference between a medal and a good-job, good-effort. A smooth surface atop the head is thus mandatory. Some swimmers still prefer to go with the single cap. And some, like Dana Vollmer in 2012, lose one along the way . The only rule is, as another famous aquatic talent once said: Just keep swimming.", "The terrifying way not sleeping enough actually changes your gut. Experts still don\u2019t fully understand why not getting enough sleep is connected to all of these conditions, but new research published this month adds one piece to the puzzle: Not getting enough sleep may cause changes to gut bacteria that could fundamentally change our metabolism, affecting a host of bodily systems. Gut microbiota are the trillions of microorganisms living in our intestines that help keep our metabolism, immune system and other bodily functions running normally, explained senior study author Jonathan Cedernaes, a sleep researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden. Mounting evidence has linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes. This new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy, Cedernaes explained.  The researchers followed nine individuals who spent two nights sleeping in a lab for eight and a half hours, and then another two nights of sleeping in a lab for only four and a half hours. The study included a fairly small number of people, but the strength behind the data is that the researchers were able to compare the effects of varied", "The one thing that will help you make better decisions. For instance, \"people are driving and it's frustrating. They get to work and the emotions they felt in their car influences what they do in their offices. Or they invest money based on emotions that stem from things unrelated to their investments,\" study researcher Ste\u0301phane Co\u0302te\u0301, a professor in the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, said in a statement. \"But our investigation reveals that if they have emotional intelligence, they are protected from these biases.\" Emotional intelligence is a term used in psychology to signal the ability to identify and control both your and others' emotions, and to apply that ability to certain tasks, according to Psychology Today. For the study, published in the journal Psychological Science, researchers conducted several experiments to evaluate how different levels of emotional intelligence influence decision-making. In one experiment, researchers found that anxiety's effect on a decision involving risk -- when that anxiety was unrelated to the decision at hand -- seemed to be blocked in people with high emotional intelligence. For people with low emotional intelligence, on the other hand, anxiety seemed to influence the decision-making. The researchers said that emotional intelligence can likely help you stop any emotions -- not", "If no-one helps you after a car crash in India, this is why. Kanhaiya Lal desperately cries for help but motorists swerve straight past him. His young son and the splayed bodies of his wife and infant daughter lie next to the mangled motorbike on which they had all been travelling seconds earlier. The widely broadcast CCTV footage of this scene - showing the suffering of a family of hit-and-run victims in northern India in 2013 and the apparent indifference of passers-by - troubled many Indians. Some motorcyclists and police eventually came to the family's aid but it was too late for Lal's wife and daughter. Their deaths sparked a nationwide debate over the role of bystanders - the media hailed it as a \"new low in public apathy\" and worse, \"the day humanity died\". But what safety campaigner Piyush Tewari saw wasn't a lack of compassion but an entire system stacked against helping road victims. His work to change this began nearly 10 years ago, when his 17-year-old cousin was knocked down on the way home from school. \"A lot of people stopped but nobody came forward to help,\" Tewari says. \"He bled to death on the side of the road.\" Tewari set out to understand this behaviour, and found the same pattern", "This Adorable Little Leaguer Stops Mid-Game To Give His Dad A Message.

Those were the words of Rupert Murdoch when asked about his top priority following the 2011 fall of News of the World in a phone hacking scandal. He was referring to Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, a subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corp. At the time, Brooks had just been cleared of all charges stemming from the hacking fiasco that ended with more than 100 arrests and the closure of News of the World, which she oversaw. While Brooks emerged from the scandal without formal punishment, she had resigned from News International and spent several months on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at News Corp. That speculation appears to have underestimated Murdoch's affinity for Brooks. Just eight months after being cleared of charges, Brooks is set to return to News Corp in a role focusing on digital media. Upward mobility Brooks enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of News Corp's tabloids to become one of the youngest top editors in Britain at the age of 32.

The act of closing the app is using up a considerable amount of your battery life, according to former Apple technician and Martiancraft CEO Kyle Richter. \"Force-quitting suspended apps will under most circumstances drain your battery faster than simply waiting for the user to return,\" Richter explained in this blog post. The iPhone was designed to put apps not in use in a \"suspended\" state so that they don't use the battery, processor, or network time when you're not actively using them. And quitting the apps that you use all the time is even harder on your battery. \"The very process of quitting an app will use up a measurable amount of battery life.

In a world increasingly saturated with dating apps, which often seem like the only way to meet someone in 2016, and correspondingly saturated with dating app fatigue, which makes it seem like nobody is going to meet anybody ever, the idea of having kids at a young age sometimes seems like something from a bygone culture.

But Her Maj is determined reign will not stop play and has ruled there should be \"no fuss\" about her momentous milestone. Instead, it is understood she will spend the day at her Balmoral holiday home. Buckingham Palace has confirmed that it will be \"business as usual\" for the 89-year-old monarch as she passes the record held by Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. Victoria reigned for 23,226 days, 16 hours and 23 minutes \u2013 or 63 years and seven months \u2013 a British record which has lasted for more than a century. She was also at Balmoral on September 23, 1896 when she passed King George III\u2019s record to become longest-reigning monarch. Then there was an outburst of national rejoicing with church bells ringing out to mark the moment and a chain of bonfires lit on the hills above Balmoral. Royal historian Hugo Vickers said: \"I rather think we might find similar spontaneous celebrations take place in September as well. \"It really is a momentous achievement to have reigned for that long and it\u2019s something that should be marked. \"Most people have lived their whole lives in her reign and I think we are jolly lucky to have her.

Ten years ago, my husband became sick with an autoimmune disease, and nutrition played a significant role in his recovery. What did I do when he got better? I became the food police, imagining that if I could control the food he and my children ate, I could keep us all healthy and safe. I figured this made me a magnificent mother and wife as well; if my family was guzzling artichokes and homemade soups and never saw sweets or chocolate, I deserved high marks. I threw out everything I deemed unhealthy and made quinoa and kale daily staples. I talked about nutrition constantly and took every meal as an opportunity to teach my kids about healthy eating. Meals were no longer fun, they were lessons. Not surprisingly, my kids became pickier and more resistant instead of embracing all the wonderful health foods I was parading in front of them. When I realised what I was doing, I had to actively recalibrate, especially the way in which I talked about food to my children and the frequency with which I talked about it. Of course it was beneficial to teach them about which foods help them grow and which ones should", "Is this what really broke Instagram?

The first was on a Friday in October 2014, when Pereira took the injured 4-year-old dog to the Elizabethtown Animal Hospital, not far from Louisville. After the veterinarian sewed up a cut, Pereira requested Tramadol, a drug used to treat pain in both animals and humans. She said the pup had been prescribed the medication in the past and had responded well to it, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. So the vet gave it to her. Three days later, she returned \u2014 saying her child had flushed the pills down the toilet. So the vet gave her more. But it was this third time, on Dec. 4, 2014, that the veterinarian became suspicions. The dog's old cut had not yet completely healed and the animal was back with another. Again, Pereira asked for Tramadol for the dog. \"That\u2019s when I took notice,\" Chad Bailey, the veterinarian, told The Washington Post in an interview last week. \"The cut looked sharp and clean \u2014 not like the kind in nature when a dog is cut on a fence or in a fight.\" Police said Pereira had been intentionally wounding her dog and \"vet shopping,\" visiting vet after vet to obtain prescription medication", "Former RHOBH star Adrienne Maloof 52 explains her 24-year-old BF.

However, Chloe and Halle Bailey\u2019s version of the National Anthem at the BET Experience\u2019s Sprite Celebrity Awards is unlike any rendition I have ever heard and it blew the entire audience away. These teen sisters grew up in Atlanta, Georgia but eventually moved to Los Angeles with their family to pursue careers in music. Their YouTube channel is what has really launched them into the music industry, singing incredible covers that garner millions of views. These girls have an insane amount of talent. Their voices show the utmost display of control and skill and they blend together in such a beautiful way. I am simply blown away by their clever harmonies and strategic pauses, it is no wonder they were recently signed to Beyonce\u2019s Parkwood Entertainment. You need to hear this performance for yourself to understand just how amazing it is. It starts off pretty normal, but as soon as they both started singing together, I had goosebumps.

We usually hear about lightning striking people, but it does kill animals, too. Two scientists at an Australian research institute have found that everything from seal pups to wild turkeys to elephants and giraffes can be killed by lightning. Was this a freak accident, or is it common? And how does this happen? I spoke to John Jensenius, a lightning safety expert from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to learn about the science behind these deadly herd strikes. (This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.) Angela Chen: First, how likely is it that it really was lightning that killed those reindeer? Is there a way to know without having seen the strike directly? John Jensenius: It isn\u2019t that unusual to see farm animals, or wild animals such as reindeer, being killed by lightning. Of course, 323 is a rather large number, though we\u2019ve seen reports of 654 sheep being killed in one spot. Animals do tend to group together in storms and huddle under trees. If lightning strikes the tree or somewhere nearby, the entire group can be killed.

The research firm Symantec has been looking into the Bangladesh bank heist, and on Thursday it posted on its blog that a similar code used to steal Bangladesh\u2019s millions was also used to hack a bank in the Philippines, as well as a failed attempt on a bank in Vietnam last year. The code, Symantec said, has also been linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures\u2019s emails. Investigators say the malware the thieves used shared similarities to the code used by a hacking group known as Lazarus. The FBI has linked this group to the Sony hacks, and those hacks to North Korea. That group has also been tied to attacks as far back as 2009, which mainly focused on the U.S. and South Korea, but it is also believed to be responsible for hacks on countries all over the world, such as the $12 million stolen from an Ecuadoran bank last year.

Natural saturated fats play a vital role when eating unprocessed foods One of the most convoluted discussions so far on the subject of eating 'natural foods\u2019 has been about the role of saturated fats in our diet. These fats earned a bad rap because of the obesity epidemic that started back in the 20th century and continues to this day. Although saturated fats were the most to be blamed, the key element that has often been overlooked is that a lot of the foods we consumed loaded with these fats were processed and packaged foods. The fats in processed foods is severely \u2018hydrogenated\u2019, making these foods hazardous to our health.

By the time she stepped on a scale to check her weight, she was 112 pounds, down from 140 pounds, reported Good Housekeeping in 2015. Her eventual diagnoses a few years later?

The Liquor That Doubles as a Mattress Refresher Hold the tonic and lime -- vodka has a new use that has less to do with your Saturday night and more to do with where you sleep when you arrive home. That's right, vodka can be used as a way to clean your mattress, which is often an overlooked task, even though you sleep -- i.e., sweat -- on it every night. The alcohol kills odor-causing bacteria while it also disinfects the mattress\u2014unlike cleaning sprays that often only mask smells with a scent. Not to mention a cheap 750-ml bottle (25.36 fluid ounces) of vodka costs less than $10, while a 16.9-fluid-ounce cleaning spray costs around $5 and won't last nearly as long. This is why Jolie Kerr, cleaning expert and author of My Boyfriend Barfed in My Handbag and Other Things You Can't Ask Martha, suggests vodka as an easy cleaning solution. Simply pour vodka into a spray bottle, distribute it evenly across your mattress by spritzing and leave it to air-dry before remaking your bed. \"The key is to spritz the mattress lightly -- you don't want to saturate it, or else it will never dry,\" says Kerr.

Users in Los Angeles (and soon in New Orleans) will get an alert that their Waze has changed how it maps their route to work. The app will no longer direct drivers to cross over or turn through busy intersections that lack a stop sign or a light, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave. In what some Waze users call a \"suicide straight,\" the app would sometimes direct drivers across multiple lanes of heavy traffic. Another concern for some is when Waze suggests a left turn through that same multi-lane traffic without a light. But Waze's Amber Kirby says, not anymore. Starting first in Los Angeles, the app may sacrifice a little time for safety. When CBS News drove with the new feature in Santa Monica, Waze had us turn left on a lightly-trafficked side street instead of across the much busier Lincoln Boulevard, sending us to a stop sign and a less stressful right turn. \"Do you guys have a sense for what this is going to do to people's commute?\" Van Cleave asked. \"How much longer is it going to make my drive to work?\" \"If you are commuting 40 minutes to an hour, maybe it adds a", "Debunking One Of The Biggest Stereotypes About Women In The Gaming Community. Although women now make up almost half of all video game players, the gaming community remains, in some ways, hostile toward women. For example, the GamerGate controversy, which began in 2014 and involved a harassment campaign against prominent female gamers, journalists and designers, reflected a longstanding undercurrent of misogyny and sexism in the community. In some cases, those who challenged the sexism found themselves threatened with rape or death. There\u2019s also the long-held stereotype that men are simply better gamers than women. Women gamers are often perceived as incompetent players who aren\u2019t genuinely interested in the games but rather sign up to get attention. If a female gamer does play well, she\u2019s often derided as a hacker \u2013 someone who cheats to gain an advantage \u2013 because \"there is no way a girl can be that good.\" In a recent study, we set out to examine whether men really make better gamers than women and, if so, what drove the gender performance gap. Specifically, we wanted to compare how quickly men and women leveled up in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, which are online worlds where thousands of players develop characters, make friends, join groups, complete quests and slay dragons together.", "Will you really be able to buy Tesla's Model 3 for $25,000?

Tesla's struggling stock rebounded on Thursday, a day after the company revised its sales forecast for 2016 upward, to 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles. There's a lot of hype around the Model 3 -- some drummed up by the company, and some created by the media. With the announcement that Tesla will begin accepting orders next month, some news reports said motorists would pay as little as $25,000 for the Model 3. Those enticing predictions bank on consumers receiving tax incentives.

By 2025 there will be 3 million pupils of secondary school age, but not enough young people are choosing to become teachers themselves. Teacher training places are going unfilled. Early last September, half of places on some such courses were sitting empty with just days to go before classes began. Government recruitment targets have been missed in the majority of subjects, including physics (by 19 per cent) and mathematics (by 16 per cent). Design and Technology only reached 41 per cent of its recruitment target this year. Meanwhile we\u2019re shedding existing teachers from our schools at record rates: 10,000 departed the profession between 2010 and 2015, and the pace of that loss is speeding up as disillusionment grows.

The city's water supply may be contaminated by a toxin harmful to humans. Health officials for Toledo issued the advisory overnight Friday into Saturday after readings at a water treatment plant revealed an excessive amount of microcystin. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) also declared a state of emergency in Lucas County, according to the Toledo Blade. The water advisory affects about 400,000 people. While healthy adults should be able to bathe and shower without issues, residents are warned not to drink or boil the water. Boiling water contaminated with microcystin will only make the toxin more harmful. Ingestion of microcystin may cause abnormal liver function, as well as diarrhea, vomiting, numbness or dizziness. The city is also recommending that restaurants and food facilities that use tap water suspend their operations until health officials give the all clear. Officials believe the toxin stems from a harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie, one source of the city's drinking water supply. Though the bloom is concentrated in the western basin near Toledo, it could affect water supplies for other cities situated near the lake.

In 2008, 1-year-old Noah Shaw was diagnosed with a rare form of eye cancer called retinoblastoma. By the time he received the diagnosis, the cancer had progressed and the treatment plan was extremely intense. Months of chemo and radiation followed, and Noah had to undergo surgery to remove his right eye to keep the cancer from spreading to his brain. That's a lot to go through in your first year of life. As worried parents often do, Bryan and Elizabeth Shaw wondered if there were any missing warning signs that would have helped get Noah's diagnosis sooner. They remembered the photographs that first raised concerns. Instead of the usual red dot of a pupil, they had noticed one of Noah's eyes appeared different from the other. Being a scientist himself, Bryan wanted to see if he could track down when that difference first appeared. Bryan and Elizabeth turned to Noah's baby pictures to see how early this symptom showed up in photos before he was diagnosed. Lo and behold, a clear warning sign is exactly what they found. It's all about a white reflection that appears in the eye in photos with a camera flash. Blood vessels in the back of", "Man Uses Lions At Zoo To Commit Suicide, But All Goes Horribly Wrong. The concept of a zoo is twofold. Primarily seen as fascinating educational opportunities, safe spaces dedicated to the preservation of endangered species, and parks filled with a variety of wildlife so that the public at large can see and learn about various animals, zoos are designed to foster the welfare of many animals, albeit in captivity. On the other hand, many people view zoos as veritable prisons, cruel jails that keep animals in questionable conditions behind bars and never allow them to live in their natural habitats in the wild. Every once in a while, a new story pops up that reminds us that even in their manmade homes, animals in zoos are still second-class citizens when it comes to the dangerous and unpredictable actions of humans.

Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Barry Smitherman, who is seeking the Republican nomination for attorney general, appeared last week before the Texas Alliance for Life to deliver a wide-ranging speech that largely centered on his opposition to China's abortion practices. He touched on a number of other abortion- and sex-related issues, arguing among other things that abortion rates have hurt the American economy. Smitherman's speech is posted at his campaign website and was reported by the Dallas Observer this week. Smitherman discussed the Chinese policy, saying that it has hurt that nation, and then compared it to the Old Testament narrative about the enslavement of the Hebrews in Egypt. He noted that in the Bible, after pharaoh orders the drowning of the first-born sons of the Hebrews, some years later Moses warns the pharaoh that \"10 plagues\" would come to Egypt, including the death of the first-born sons, if he does not release the Hebrews. \"Attempts at genocide, like pharaoh's, do not go without inevitable 'reckoning.'

D.B. sued Safe Sedation LLC and Safe Sedation Management in Fairfax County Court for defamation, infliction of emotional distress and illegally disclosing his health records. The patient said he left his phone on and recorded everything on accident. When he later drove home with his wife, they discovered the recording. The doctors, Tiffany Ingham and Soloman Shah, are not named as defendants but are accused of mocking D.B. as soon as the anesthetic knocked him out. \"Tiffany Ingham, M.D. started to mock, and then continued to mock, the amount of medicine required to anesthetize plaintiffs,\" the complaint states. \"Referring to plaintiff, Soloman Shah, M.D. commented that a teaching physician known to both him and Tiffany Ingham, M.D. 'would eat him for lunch.' \"Tiffany Ingham, M.D. agreed that plaintiff would be 'eaten alive' and also jokingly discussed a hypothetical of firing a gun up a rectum,\" it says. \"And really,", "This picture of a young Harrison Ford may be too much for you to handle.

It may sound difficult, but making your own pasta is actually much easier than you might think. If you have a pasta maker, the most difficult part is probably setting up the machinery (you can also make pasta by hand). Whichever route you take, homemade is as simple as mixing together two or three ingredients. The basic process consists of mixing flour and water -- and egg if you want -- together, kneading it into dough, letting the dough rest for a while, and cutting noodles. As author and food blogger David Lebovitz says, pasta dough isn't as fussy as pastry or bread dough. It's \"simple and forgiving, [and] one of those recipes that\u2019s more about technique than ingredients or quantities.\" If you're still not convinced, here's something to consider: Homemade pasta is so satisfying that it needs little else to make a completely delicious meal, especially if you've added something flavorful, like spinach or beets, to the pasta dough. Sometimes, a drizzle of good, fruity olive oil is all you need. So you can put the energy you might spend on an elaborate sauce into the homemade noodles.

Now, 18 years later, the 49-year-old is still ripped to fuck. Growing up, Statham was a typically sporty lad, and was actually introduced to football by none other than Vinnie Jones, his childhood friend, who'd he later act alongside. Statham was also a keen diver in his younger years, starting when he was just 11-years-old. He went on to be a part of Britain's National Diving Squad for 12 years, and even represented England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. Eventually he was picked up by an agency called Sports Promotions which specialised in sports modelling, before he became a model for French Connection. All of that, grouped with his many action roles, most of which he performs his own stunts for, have required him to stay in great shape. But how's he maintained it for all of these years?

On an episode of The James Altucher podcast, behavioral economist and Duke University professor Dan Ariely drew on such research to generate an easy solution to a common source of marital discord. To make your partner appreciate you more, occasionally remind them of all the ways you're contributing to the family. Let's back up to explain why this solution works. In one oft-cited study, psychologists asked members of couples individually how much they contributed to the housework. The total generally added up to more than 100%. In other words, both partners think they do more than they really do \u2014 and underestimate how much their partner does. (Interestingly, each person also tended to overestimate how much they contributed to conflicts in the relationship, suggesting that it's more about egocentrism than self-aggrandizement.) You can see how this might pose a problem, at least in the chores department. Your partner thinks she takes out the trash 70% of the time and you think you take out the trash 70% of the time, so you each end up thinking the other is lazy.

A Tennessee company made some from glass and failed so spectacularly that only one known unbroken penny remains \u2014 and it is scheduled to be auctioned Thursday. Another broken piece is also known to exist. The Fort Lauderdale-based Heritage Auctions will conduct in-person and online bidding for the coin that it hopes will exceed $30,000.

It sounds scary\u2014and it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry\u2014but keeping your feet covered is mostly precautionary. Jacobsen says that for most of us, the risk of contracting an infection from going sock-less at security is pretty low. In part, that\u2019s because security lines are well-ventilated and have dry floors, so you\u2019re unlikely to pick up either foot fungi (think: athlete\u2019s foot) or plantar warts\u2014both of which tend to come from damp environments, like locker rooms with showers.

Facebook has announced it will create a \"dislike button.\" Only last year, Mark Zuckerberg said, \"Some people have asked for a dislike button because they want to be able to say 'that thing isn't good,' and we're not going to do that ... I don't think that's socially very valuable, or great for the community.\" Now, Zuckerberg has admitted that \"not every moment is good\" and perhaps a dislike button isn't such a bad idea after all. It seems that we have been become so fragile that any sign of negativity -- even a simple thumbs down on a social media website -- is something that must be avoided at all costs. All we want is a constant stream of thumbs up. The slightest sign someone might disagree with us is enough to send us into an emotional tailspin. Zuckerberg may have changed his mind, but many other people have not. Some think the dislike button will toxify relationships. Others fear it will fuel bullying and other kinds of aggressive behavior online . But the biggest worry is the button will \" actively foster negativity .\" It seems we have become so fragile that any sign", "An adult film actress says parents shouldn't work in porn for a very surprising reason. One of the panelists, plus-size porn actress Kelly Shibari, said she feels any parent with children younger than 18 years old should not work in adult film for a very surprising reason. \"Any sort of adult entertainment is, as far as I'm concerned, an extremely selfish line of work, just in the requirements or the hours that are given to you,\" she said. Shibari explained that it would be nearly impossible to spend quality time with a child while making evening appearances and fulfilling other time-consuming requirements that it takes to be a successful adult film actress. \"It has very little do with sex and more to do with the availability that you should be there for your children,\" she said.

I still meet people every day who tell me they believe this. But once I learned that doing this instead could make me more successful, I got really excited. Before I get to what it is, check out what I found in my research: A study in Outliers tracked people with the highest IQ in the world from birth until adulthood. At first, they were doing wonderfully. But once they got older, their success was no different than a random control group. Some were garbage collectors or worse! What\u2019s the message? That most people think IQ, an unchangeable measure of skill, is the key to success. And i t isn\u2019t.

My grandmother once told me this little story that stuck with me. One afternoon at a doctor\u2019s appointment, her doctor moved her large purse to another chair and remarked how heavy it was. \"You must be very rich,\" he said to her. \"I am,\" she said affirmatively. My grandparents lived modestly, still in the narrow two-bedroom rowhouse where she\u2019d raised her family since her husband returned from World War II. They didn\u2019t travel, eat lavish meals or shop at the finest department stores. Neither had careers that followed their passions. (She would have been an amazing teacher, he an exquisite artist.) Yet, she genuinely considered herself rich because she had a husband, children and grandchildren whom she adored.

(Vanity Fair) When I saw the new cover, with Zuckerberg in his signature grey tee and blue jeans, I wondered whether Diehl had styled the cover in a genius homage to the Facebook founder\u2019s personal uniform. In the past, he has attributed his perennial look to a desire to focus his energy on important business decisions, rather than what he characterized as \"silly or frivolous\" choices, such as what to wear. (The personal uniform here becomes the fashion analog of meal-replacement beverage Soylent.) I pictured Zuckerberg, safely protected from decision fatigue, while assistants pored over a rack of luxury approximations of his everyday grey tee. Armani or Vince? Lang or Wang? Alas, a Vanity Fair spokesperson has confirmed, there was no stylist for this cover, and no designers credited. Zuckerberg wore his own clothes, saving everyone involved in the cover shoot from wasting their brain capacity on fashion. Despite Diehl\u2019s recent statement that the magazine\u2019s cover \"is not your casual-jeans Tuesday\" (in reference to Vanity Fair\u2019s issue starring Caitlyn Jenner), Zuckerberg\u2019s Tuesday cover suggests otherwise.

The titles in question aren't minor releases either - one of them is expected to shift 4 million units within the financial year, while the second title should hit between 2 and 4 million units, and the final one should be in the 2 million range. One of the titles is a Monster Hunter game and, given Capcom's statement that was widely reported yesterday regarding a 'full-scale offensive' for Resident Evil this year, it's probably safe to say at least one of them is a Resident Evil game as well.

While getting stung by a bumblebee may hurt, it is not dangerous at all and is in fact worse for the bee itself rather than for the person that got stung. Yellow jackets and wasps pose a whole new threat though, because they are faster, stronger, and have much more powerful poison in their stingers than bees do. That is why if somebody is allergic to bee stings, getting stung by a wasp can be extremely painful, and sometimes even fatal if not handled correctly. One man from Tampa, Florida, was out gardening on a seemingly normal day when he did not notice a wasp nest hidden beneath some plants in his front lawn. John Clark missed the nest, and accidentally stepped on it, ushering a swarm of yellow jackets to come out and attack him. John got stung four times, and made his way inside to rest and get treatment.

The university, where the average senior with loans graduated with nearly $29,000 in debt in 2012, began sending students letters each year telling them how much they'd already borrowed, what their interest rates were, and what their monthly payment would be after graduation. And in response, students seem to have borrowed less. It's too early to tell how much the behavior of individual borrowers changed, but in aggregate, students at IU took 11 percent less in federal loans during the 2013-'14 school year. Indiana is celebrating this as a success. The experiment indicates how little many students know about what their financial obligations will be after graduation. But it's not clear whether IU's solution gets at the root of the student debt problem: Are students really borrowing more than they need, or are there other factors driving high debt? Why student loan borrowers often don't know their monthly payment If you're taking out an auto loan or a mortgage, you already know what your monthly payment will be. If you're paying your credit card bill, there's a box on the statement telling you how long it will take to pay off the debt if you make only the monthly minimums.

While the percentages are roughly comparable, that doesn't mean the number of people planning to vote against Clinton (as opposed to voting for Trump) is the same as the number who plan to vote against Trump (as opposed to voting for Clinton).

Still, the sizes of both of those numbers are striking. To be fair, the general dislike of both candidates can be explained partly by negative partisanship, which has been increasing for some time. In 2014, Pew researchers found that over the past two decades the share of both Republicans and Democrats who have a very unfavorable opinion of the other party has more than doubled (from 17 percent to 43 percent for Republicans, and from 16 percent to 38 percent for Democrats).

It is an expensive bet on a state that has almost always voted red. But there\u2019s a simple reason behind what seems like a gamble: Nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district. So a Republican candidate can win in the state, but a Democratic candidate can still pick up electoral votes by winning over a district. The second congressional district, which is centered in Omaha and its suburbs, has a history of occasionally voting differently from the rest of deep-red Nebraska. The district went for Mitt Romney in 2012 but for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. In 2014, when Democrats lost a wave of congressional races across the country, Democrat Brad Ashford won the district\u2019s seat in U.S. Congress. And as a Clinton aide pointed out, the African-American share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average\u2014and Clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters. The electoral college\u2019s winner-take-all system means that reliably Democratic states like Massachusetts and Oregon\u2014or reliably Republican states like Texas and Alabama\u2014are never seriously contested by presidential candidates.

This, on top of all the problems we encountered once we were finally able to get into the game, has left us (and I\u2019m sure many others) wondering whether DICE and EA are in danger of repeating the same mistakes that led Battlefield 4\u2019s infamously rocky launch.

But at the White House, one former staffer explained to the Washington Post, women started using a simple rhetorical technique to stop interruptions and reinforce points made by other women. When a woman made a good point, another woman would repeat it, and give credit to the originator. This made the idea harder to ignore, or to steal. The women called the technique \"amplification.\" \"We just started doing it, and made a purpose of doing it,\" one of president Barack Obama\u2019s former aides told the Post. \"It was an everyday thing.\" She said that Obama noticed and began calling on women more often.

Hawking gave a poignant message to people suffering from depression, making a poetic comparison between depression and a black hole \u2013 no matter how dark they seem, neither are impossible to escape. Hawking said: \"The message of this lecture is that black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. \"Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up \u2013 there's a way out.\" He gave the speech in front of a crowd of over 400 people on Thursday evening, January 7, as part of the Reith lecture at the Royal Institute in London. The lecture was scheduled for November last year, but had to be postponed due to Hawking\u2019s poor health. Hawking, who turned 74 the day after the lecture, has lived with motor neuron disease for almost 53 years \u2013 despite being told he had just two years to live when diagnosed in 1963. Speaking to the same audience, his daughter Lucy noted Hawking\u2019s incredible mental fitness \u2013 both intellectually and emotionally. \"He has a very enviable wish", "Don't forget the most important part of your Super Bowl party (hint: it's not beer or wings).

Best of all, we've included expert curated playlist for every activity, giving you the boost to handle the chores and your guests the backdrop for a great day. Let's get started. Two Days Before Start eating everything in your fridge so you have room for food and alcohol to chill before your party. Decide on seating.

In general, Medicare does a great job of providing seniors with affordable access to a huge list of basic healthcare services, but that doesn't mean there aren't a few gaping coverage holes. In fact, millions of enrollees might be in for a rude awakening when they learn about some of the basic healthcare services that regular Medicare simply won't pay for. Vision Believe it or not, Medicare generally doesn't cover many ophthalmological services at all. That includes a very basic list of things that millions need to see properly, such as contact lenses or eyeglasses. Even routine eye exams won't be covered. If you're in need of any of those things, then you'll likely be forced to pay for them yourself. That fact is surprising, especially when you consider that the American Optometric Association states that vision problems tend to start for most people in their mid-40s. Time only makes the problem worse, which is why why so many seniors are forced to carry around prescription glasses. And yet, in most cases, those glasses won't be paid for by Medicare. Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule, assuming certain conditions are met. As an example, if you have", "Do gay marriages increase abortion rates? Heritage recently publicized the claims of \"100 scholars\" attacking marriage equality. Almost without exception, the \"scholars\" in question are deeply religious and put their faith ahead of facts. These are the people behind the claim that same-sex marriage increases abortion. According to them, same-sex marriage changes how heterosexuals act. Beyond causing 100 scholars to make total asses of themselves, I'm not sure there is anything to the theory. They claim same-sex marriage \"devalues\" marriage for heterosexuals. I assume by inflating the supply of marriage, they think each marriage is worth less. Why or how this devaluation takes place, and why heterosexuals are so irrational as to calculate the value of their own marriage on the basis of who else is married, is not explained. They make two leaps in their logic. The first is gay marriage devalues all marriage. Second, when you devalue marriage, and fewer women get married, they will have more abortions. Therefore, same-sex marriage will lead to more abortions. As Ayn Rand was known to say, \"Check your premises.\" One problem is the total number of abortions in the United States has been declining, even as the number of married gay couples has increased.

Better than me. My brother (Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett) would argue that, but Tannehill was one of the best athletes I've even seen. He ran a 4.4. He could do every type of dunk. He was just cool. He was just a smooth, cool guy. \"I've always liked Tannehill. I like him. He went to the same school as me. I'm not going to like him on Sunday. That's a whole different story. I like him as a guy. He was always a good guy to me.\" The same Michael Bennett evoked Tannehill's name last summer while bemoaning the high salaries of today's passers. \"Quarterback is the only position in the NFL where you could be mediocre and get paid,\" Bennett told 710 ESPN's \"Brock and Salk\" program. \"At every other position, you can't be mediocre.

While Maria sat unaware and bound to her wheelchair, the man proceeded to swiftly grab $600 in social security money out from her bra, where she kept it so it would stay safe.

Incredible but true. So, wait, let me back up and talk about Half-Life, which is the third-greatest shooter of all time after Halo: Combat Evolved and Quake, which are tied for first place. Half-Life\u2019s greatness comes from two distinct elements. The first, which everyone has talked about since it was released 18 years ago, is how Half-Life feels real. At the time, it was an incredible feat, and all these years later, it still is. Despite the aging graphics, my journeys through Black Mesa always feel as real and vibrant as they did the day I first played Half-Life, back in 2007. The other, more important element is the way Half-Life motivates you. See, one of the things that enhanced the realism were the game\u2019s other characters. Sure, they were two-dimensional stick figures, but they showed up when it mattered. As the game opens, they\u2019re kind of mean to you; you get the sense that people resent Gordon\u2019s presence. It characterizes Gordon too: he seems to be perpetually", "What happens when these total strangers share eye contact for a whole minute? The results are quite extraordinary. On one day in June last year, a public experiment was conducted in Perth, Australia to find out how people would respond when they were invited to share eye contact with a stranger for a full minute. What happens next is surprisingly poignant. Although no words were spoken, many participants found themselves getting quite emotional. In the quiet moments they shared with the person sitting opposite, it was almost as though they came to a mutual understanding. Watch the heartwarming experiment unfold below. The video, which has since gone viral, was created by a social activist collective called The Liberators International . Founded by artist Peter Sharp, the organisation describe their mission as, \"To involve people in participatory acts of freedom that allow us to see that beyond our differences there is love and humanity.\" Holding someone\u2019s gaze can reveal intimate details about emotions and intentions. It\u2019s hardly surprising then that many find eye contact to be more powerful than words. It\u2019s a formula that SBS is putting to the test in a unique new upcoming documentary series that explores the power of eye contact. ...And we want YOU to participate. Is there a painful rift", "The truth behind the world's most reliable IQ test. And while it's nice to think you can take a quick IQ test and potentially discover that you\u2019re actually a genius, people rarely question what it actually means - or how a set of questions can actually measure it. Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman once explained IQ like this: If a subject\u2019s 'mental age' was the same as his or her physical age, their 'intelligence quotient,' or IQ, was defined as exactly 100. If a subject lagged in mental age compared to physical age, the IQ was less than a hundred; if she was more mentally advanced, she was assigned an IQ above 100. Unfortunately, the most comprehensive IQ test doesn\u2019t actually exist, because they don\u2019t really work. Scientists have argued that intelligence cannot simply be measured by asking a few questions and assigning a score, as much as we would like it to. Siddartha Mukherjee, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Gene: An Intimate History, explains: Intelligence and temperament are not marathon races: there are no fixed criteria for success, no start or finish lines \u2014 and running sideways or backward, might secure victory. In short, there's no objective measure of intelligence - it's a multifaceted thing.", "The top model of 2013 is...

What better way to prepare for seeing her on-screen in the Cameron Diaz rom-com \"The Other Woman\" next year?", "Hilarious tattoo fails show how things go badly wrong when the inker can't spell. But one warning that seems to be overlooked is to make sure that the tattoo artist can spell before allowing them to get to work with the needle.  Hilariously tattoo fails have been sweeping Instagram, as people can't help poking fun at incorrect spellings and grammatical disasters.  One man who wanted to make a striking statement to his haters was no doubt disappointed when the message across his shoulders came out as: 'Only god can fudge me'. The motivational slogan to 'never give up' also fell rather flat after an unnecessary 'don't' was thrown in for good measure.  Equally, a woman was no doubt asking for a refund for her inspirational slogan, which was inked on as: 'Stay strong no matter \"waht\" happens'  And a devoted son was surely fuming after he got a touching tribute to the woman who gave birth to him inked down his arm.   His celebration of his mother turned from heartwarming to hilarious when the inker wrote: 'Thanks \"mather for my life\".'  Another man had 'no regrets' inked across his chest but was ironically left with lots of them after he realised he'd been permanently branded with 'no regrats'.", "Couples Had Sex Every Day For A Month With Unexpected Results.

But in reality, it\u2019s a fine specimen of Dermochelys coriacea \u2014 commonly known as the leatherback turtle, due to its lack of a bony shell. Dermochelys is the largest living species of turtle on the planet, and the fourth largest species of modern reptile (crocodiles, alligators and their close kin top that list), so I guess it is kind of a monster... but as you can see, aside from its hideous maw, it\u2019s actually rather cute. That nasty mouth with its inward-curving spikes is ideally suited to ensnaring jellyfish, which are the leatherback\u2019s primary source of food.

Please consult a qualified health care professional for personalized medical advice. Do I really need to wipe down the machines at the gym? When it comes to good gym etiquette, our Facebook fans and Twitter followers told us wiping sweat off of shared equipment and machines is basically their Golden Rule. But even though it's gross to lie down into a puddle of someone else's perspiration on the bench press, there's not actually anything inherently germy about sweat. So what's the deal? Turns out, our health-minded community is on to something. Warm, moist environments are where bacteria really like to grow, says Dr. Pritish Tosh, M.D., infectious diseases physician at the Mayo Clinic. And if the gym isn't a warm, moist environment, we don't know what is. \"There is certainly a potential for transmission of certain kinds of infections,\" he says.

So it only makes sense that Lyndon Rive, SolarCity CEO and Musk's cousin, figured it was worth asking Musk for a discount on a Tesla. (Musk is also chairman of SolarCity.) But when Rive finally got around to asking Musk for the discount, he was met with a pretty funny burn. \"I asked, 'Elon, hey can I have a family discount' and his answer is, 'Yeah absolutely. Go to TeslaMotor.com, buy the car online, and the price you see there is the family discount,'\" Rive told Tech Insider. \"Everyone gets a family discount.\" So there you have it: Musk does not believe in preferential treatment for family members. \"I give Elon credit beyond the fact of being the best entrepreneur in the world, he treats everyone the same. Everyone. There's no nepotism at all,\" Rive said. Not that the lack of a discount deterred Rive at all. Rive has a Model S and his wife has a Model X, he said.

To grow potatoes, you plant ACTUAL POTATOES, not seeds. Alternatively, you can plant pieces of potato, as long as each piece has at least two eyes. 2. Not to be a potato stan*, but potatoes are VERY GOOD FOR YOU. Fresh potatoes are considered one of the most satiety-promoting food in existence. (Meaning you stay full between meals vs. just feeling full as you eat.) They have more potassium than bananas. (A 100-gram potato has 425 milligrams; a 100-gram banana has 358 milligrams.) And when eaten in combination with milk (or cheese), they become pretty much the perfect food, nutrient-wise \u2014 like, you aren\u2019t going hungry or getting scurvy as long as you have potatoes. *Who am I kidding? I am 100% a potato stan. Potatoes are my favorite food IN PART BECAUSE THEY ARE SO GOOD FOR YOU. 3. But for a long time, large swaths of people were incredibly suspicious of potatoes and thought potatoes could kill them. Andrew F. Smith writes in Potato: A Global History that when the potato came to Europe from South America in the sixteenth century, a lot of people were like, \"Nah, keep it.\" Many herbalists believed that potatoes were poisonous, and", "MIT researches can read a book without opening the cover. A decade ago, a group at MIT demonstrated the ability to look through a sealed envelope using terahertz waves \u2013 the band of electromagnetic radiation between microwaves and infrared light. The project led Barmak Heshmat, a present-day research scientist at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, to question just how deep one could look through a closed book using terahertz waves. Working closely with researchers from Georgia Tech, Heshmat and company have demonstrated the ability to identify letters up to nine pages deep. As technology continues to advance, the team no doubt hopes to be able to peer deeper into a book without opening it. In terms of practicality, the team says the technique could be used to study ancient books that are so fragile that they can\u2019t be opened without risk of destroying their contents.

In a brief but at times introspective interview, Mrs. Clinton said that although other countries have been led by women, such a milestone would be different were it to happen in the United States. She called the demands of the American political system more personally grueling and difficult. \"I really believe our system is probably the most challenging in the world,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"If you\u2019re a prime minister, you\u2019re chosen by your peers,\" she continued. \"If you\u2019re president, you run statewide, but it\u2019s usually with the backing of a party and you don\u2019t have to raise the money to run.\" But, she added, \"Women candidates all face the same scrutiny, and questions about ourselves, so there are similarities.\" The implications of her claiming the Democratic nomination for president \u2014 the first woman to do so for a major American political party \u2014 became clear quickly for Mrs. Clinton, 68, in recent days. Prominent women and many male leaders have \"reached out to me in recent days to encourage me and say how much this election means to their country and the world.\" \"It\u2019s something I\u2019m still processing,\" Mrs. Clinton added.

But the answer isn't to just toss in a second stereotypical \"plus-size\" body type to counteract the effect of the skinny one. Tyra Banks, currently on a campaign with Special K to ban fat talk and promote positive body image, told HuffPost Style that the labels that separate women are also harmful: \"I don't like the label 'plus-size' -- I call it 'fiercely real.'

Kayley Burke shared photos on Facebook of her 11-month-old boy who was too young to be vaccinated, covered in horrific blisters and scabs from this terrible disease which also was the reason for a secondary infection in his tiny body. Burke uploaded these photos in a single post on Facebook which so far has been shared over than 4.300 times. In that same post she wrote the following:", "A Woman Popped A Growth On Her Son's Knee And Found Something Pretty Gross Inside. Rachel Franklin\u2019s seven-year-old son, Paul, scratched his knee at a beach near their home in Orange County, California. The wound got infected, so Rachel took her son to the doctors. Believing it was the simple kind of infection kids tend to get when they scuff their knee, they sent him on his way with some antibiotics and told them not to pop the growth. However, the swelling turned black and began to ooze pus, so Franklin decided to take matters into her own hands and drain it. Turns out, the growth was actually a small sea snail covered in a layer of pus. \"I realised it wasn't a rock. It has whirls on it. I turn it over and I think \u2013 I might have laughed out loud. I said, \u2018Paul. This is a snail. It\u2019s a freaking snail,\u2019\" said Franklin on the program Monster Inside Me, which featured the weird series of events from back in 2013 in an episode that aired on the Animal Planet channel October 29.

The much awaited mobile phone game, which released this week has received a warm response from the fans. Pokemon GO uses the camera and the GPS of the smartphone to track down real world Pokemon, but the players must make sure that they keep away from visiting some places while catching them.

The data, which reflects searches on Google Shopping, indicate this year is all about the 2013 memes and cult shows.

Same goes for \"Breaking Bad\" costumes. At least Daenerys from \"Game Of Thrones\" has a look that can be easily recreated with an icy wig; Walter and Jesse from \"Breaking Bad,\" on the other hand, are probably more challenging to imitate accurately in costume form. That would probably explain why people are Googling it so much -- Google notes that searches for \"Breaking Bad\" costumes are three times higher this year, on the heels of the series finale, than they were last year.

It read, in part: We\u2019ve seen this story before in Louisiana, and we don\u2019t deserve a sequel. In 2005, a fly-over by a vacationing President George W. Bush became a symbol of official neglect for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The current president was among those making political hay out of Bush\u2019s aloofness.

But we don\u2019t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace.

Because the average large egg contains between 180 and 186 milligrams of cholesterol, just one immediately counts for over half of your recommended daily intake, the Huffington Post reports. However, it's a little more complicated than that: It turns out cholesterol is actually already being produced, in rather significant amounts, by your body \u2013 1 to 2 grams each day on average. But when you consume foods that contain cholesterol, your body's production of the substance decreases to make up for it. You don't really add cholesterol to existing amounts, you're replacing one kind with another. Authority Nutrition makes another excellent point: While cholesterol has negative connotations for obvious reasons, it is not a purely harmful molecule. Cholesterol is a vital part of the body, and is essential in creating testosterone, estrogen and cortisol. The website also reports a study where a group of individuals took to eating one to three whole eggs a day. For 70 percent of those people, eggs did not negatively affect cholesterol levels. For the remaining 30 percent, the issue was fairly benign as well: Eggs were found to change LDL cholesterol (the harmful variety) from small, dense molecules to larger ones, which made them a", "Why cars went from boxy in the '80s to curvy in the '90s. One thing stands out: all of the cars look super boxy, especially compared with the curving, rounded exteriors of virtually every car on the market today. This underappreciated transformation is probably the most distinct design change to come to cars over the past half-century, and for most US cars, it happened within just a few years, starting in 1986. You can even pinpoint the exact year curves arrived for some models \u2014 like the Buick LeSabre, which had much harder edges along its hood, roof, and trunk in 1991 (left) than 1992 (right): In the decades since, cars have just gotten curvier and curvier. Why the big shift? It turns out it was largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes. It all started with European luxury designs By the 1980s, making curved cars wasn't an entirely novel idea \u2014 it had just largely gone out of fashion among US automakers. The streamliners of the 1930s, such as the Chrysler Airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance. But the Airflow and other streamlined American models were commercial", "There was one very important thing missing from the Marco Rubio pancake breakfast:. The cardboard costumed Rubio-bots mechanically handing out broken gaskets were not New Hampshire voters. At least 50 percent of the 800 or so attendees were not New Hampshire voters. There were no pancakes at the pancake breakfast. So went Marco Rubio's morning after, the morning after an Ambien-esque nightmare of a debate performance where Chris Christie repeatedly pounced on him for reciting the same anti-Obama talking point, nearly word for word, four times. \"There it is!\" gleeful scorekeeper Christie called on ball three, \"The memorized 25-second speech!\" Londonderry High School was greeted first by two cardboard and tinfoil robots, who mechanically droned Rubio's now-defining line, \"Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing,\" over and over. Although the beleaguered Rubio campaign was quick to call it another Bush dirty trick, the Marco Robotos were animated by operatives from Democratic Super PAC American Bridge. Kevin McAllister, the PAC's deputy communications director-turned-costumed robot, said the campaign's only inspiration was provided by Christie, and the opportunity was irresistible.

Online reports that at Timberlake's 20/20 Experience World Tour on Tuesday a fan suddenly reached up from the audience and tried to grab a piece of the 33-year-old performer's glutes. Undeterred by the handsy fan, JT managed to swat away the woman -- while still keeping rhythm. The whole thing was so sudden that most of the crowd barely noticed. Timberlake has had to deal with an odd crowd on several different occasions. In November, he noticed a female fan flipping him the bird and stopped to address the situation. \"Why are you flipping me off?\" the performer asked in between songs. \"You got second row to flip me the bird? That makes no f---ing sense.\" The in-audience culprit appeared to respond, and Timberlake continued: \"Oh you wanted me to see you?

Here\u2019s the Truth About How Much You Should Consume. . There's no single formula for how much water someone should drink \u2014 it depends on their weight, activity level and environment. Typically, someone should drink about four to six cups of water a day to aid the hydration that comes with eating foods that have fluid in them, according to the Harvard Health Letter Ultimately, the best method to optimal hydration is to listen to our intuitive thirst levels.

The Grammy award-winning singer, who has yet to appear in a feature film, is rumored for the starring role in an upcoming biopic about late singer Dusty Springfield. Born in England in the '30s, Springfield was a celebrated soul singer who nabbed a spot in the Grammy and Rock and Roll Halls of Fame. After releasing multiple chart-topping singles and albums, Springfield died in 1999 at the age of 59. Rumors about a Springfield biopic have been making the rounds for months. In 2011 it was announced that Nick Hurran (\"Little Black Book\"), would direct the project, with early reports speculating that Kristin Chenoweth would take the lead role. \"Boardwalk Empire\" producer David Stenn is also reportedly attached to write the script. While little progress has been made on the forthcoming film as of late, Adele's name is being tossed around for the part and may reinvigorate plans for the biopic. An unnamed source told the Daily Star, \"Adele is attached to a project, but it\u2019s in the early stages of development.\" Adele, who hasn't commented on the possibility of playing Springfield, was rumored for another film role earlier this year.

What's more, a Peruvian ship worker also asked us, \"Is that your daughter?

But what does it mean to be a small business? The traditional American dream for a small business is something along the lines of a brick and mortar office or store, a steady salary, perhaps a few employees and, if it ends up being sustainable, a family asset to pass along to the next generation.  Over the last few decades, however, that popular idea has begun to change, particularly when we start thinking about small businesses like tech startups. While all businesses start up and start out small, not all small businesses are startups. Whereas a small business is founded to be profitable and create a good living for the entrepreneur and his or her family, a startup is founded with the intention of rapidly achieving exponential growth through scale, and either being acquired in a few years by a larger company, or becoming a unicorn and going public in an IPO...in both cases bringing in massive returns to its founders and investors.

Interviewer: Maranda Pleasant Maranda Pleasant: What are you passionate about in life? Bellamy Young: For me, singing. I wouldn\u2019t make it through the day without singing. It is my solace and my meditation and my release. It lets me know how I\u2019m processing things, what I\u2019m processing, if I\u2019m out of touch in some area. I will just think, why am I singing? Then I will know everything I need to know about what I\u2019m feeling. But also, kindness. That is what thrills me, personally. Small acts of kindness; thoughtful, large acts of kindness. I feel like we\u2019re in a bit of a precipice, and I think that any beautiful energy on the kindness continuum will just help us fall into a lovelier place.

If you've booked a holiday, but are yet to exchange your pounds for a foreign currency, you're going to be a victim of Britain leaving the EU I'm afraid.

According to the experts at Career Girl Daily, despite showering every morning, most of us are doing it wrong. They share a 90-second hack you can do whilst washing yourself in the morning to boost your energy and keep you awake all day. And Victoria Beckham swears by it.  If you think that taking a hot shower in the morning sets you up for the day ahead, think again. Indeed, according to the experts, dousing your body in warm water is actually sending you back to sleep. They found that when we feel colder air on our skin after getting out of the shower, the drastic temperate drop causes a tranquil state of mind.  You should, in fact, blast yourself with cold water for 30 seconds, followed by hot water for 30 seconds and freezing water again for 30 seconds. It might be unpleasant but it opens capillaries and boosts circulation so stimulates your body and mind. It also apparently reduces stress because it builds up your 'tolerance levels', boosts your immune system by creating more white blood cells and helps you burn fat more effectively.

The company explains that the oats used in Cheerios were never genetically modified, but that the corn starch is now non-GMO: It\u2019s the unique and simple nature of original Cheerios that made this possible \u2013 and even that required significant investment over nearly a year. Cheerios\u2019 principal ingredient has always been whole grain oats, and there are no GMO oats. We use just a small amount of corn starch in cooking, and just one gram of sugar per serving for taste. So we were able to change how we source and handle ingredients to ensure that the corn starch for original Cheerios comes only from non-GMO corn, and our sugar is only non-GMO pure cane sugar. General Mills will not be making other varieties of Cheerios GMO-free. \"For our other cereals, the widespread use of GM seed in crops such as corn, soy, or beet sugar would make reliably moving to non-GM ingredients difficult, if not impossible,\" the website says.

In their lawsuit filed Friday in federal court, Karolis Kubelskas and Emily Brunner claim that they were forced to regularly work off the clock because of unreasonably low payroll budgets provided to individual Jimmy John's stores, leading to minimum wage and overtime violations. Jimmy John's has \"intentionally and repeatedly misrepresented the true time worked by their hourly employees\" in order to keep costs down and dodge overtime laws, the complaint alleges. The lawsuit is a proposed class action, with Kubelskas and Brunner arguing that such pay practices come from \"corporate set policies\" and would apply to other workers. Jimmy John's did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Kubelskas and Brunner, Jimmy John's workers aren't given enough time to complete all their closing duties at the end of the day, at which point managers clock them out regardless of whether or not they continue to work. The practice is exacerbated, they claim, by a company policy that bases managers' bonuses largely on whether or not they hit their targets on labor costs.

Two Dutch citizens were among 30 people on board the Arctic Sunrise, a Greenpeace ship, which was seized by Russian authorities last month after activists staged the protest at the Prirazlomnaya offshore oil platform.

The Russian government declined immediate comment. \"The Netherlands today began an arbitration procedure on the basis of the (United Nations) Convention on the Law of the Sea,\" Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans wrote in a letter to the Dutch parliament.

Eventually, his raw talent was recognised and he got a post at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked with G.H. Hardy until his untimely death at the age of 32 in 1920. Despite his short life, Ramanujan made substantial contributions to number theory, elliptic functions, infinite series, and continued fractions. The story seems to suggest that mathematical ability is something at least partly innate. But what does the evidence say? From language to spatial thinking There are many different theories about what mathematical ability is. One is that it is closely tied to the capacity for understanding and building language. Just over a decade ago, a study examined members of an Amazonian tribe whose counting system comprised words only for 'one', 'two' and 'many'. The researchers found that the tribe were exceptionally poor at performing numerical thinking with quantities greater than three. They argued this suggests language is a prerequisite for mathematical ability. But does that mean that a mathematical genius should be better at language than the average person? There is some evidence for this. In 2007, researchers scanned the brains of 25 adult students while they were solving multiplication problems. The study found that individuals with higher mathematical", "'West Wing' cast reunites, reveals who President Bartlet would endorse in 2016.

Restaurants have outdoor seating, there are festivals all over town, and you don't have to worry about bringing your jacket to Top of the Rock. But long-time city dwellers know the horror behind the mystique: those awful smells that dominate every daily commute to and from the office. Here's why it's hard to escape the stench of the city in the heat of summer. New York City has the highest population density in the US, and with 8,550,405 people roaming the nation\u2019s melting pot, it\u2019s bound to get smelly. A census conducted in July 2015 showed that the city had a population density of over 27,000 people per square mile.

Fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.) Notice that I said \"men.\" Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall. The gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents.", "What would happen if the Olympics banned Russia?

The suspects are accused of forcing the victim to drink toilet water and kiss the floor, stuffing a sock into his mouth, taping his mouth shut and binding his hands with a belt.

On the downside, you now work long hours, wear uncomfortable shoes all day and can't take naps. Even worse, your paychecks get divided pretty evenly between rent, food and student loan payments. Understandably, you haven't bothered to start a retirement fund yet \u2014 you're only 23! You have 39 years before you need to even start worrying about retirement, right? Wrong. We spoke with Dan Egan, director of behavioral finance and investments at Betterment, and Qapital founder and CEO George Friedman about why every young adult needs to be planning their financial future \u2014 and why it's so difficult. \"The 20s are a crucial time to start building wealth and saving for retirement,\" Egan said. \"The younger you start investing, the more you can reap the benefits of compounding and long-term market gains. Additionally, at this age, you can afford to invest more aggressively and take on a little more risk in order to earn better returns.\" When asked how much a person should set aside, Egan said that it varies by situation. However, he would give everyone the same advice. \"The simple answer: save more.

Last night's episode saw the crowning of a new king after Joffrey's untimely (but well-deserved) death via a poisoned goblet during his wedding festivities. We've all moved on, some of us more quickly than others -- we're looking at you, Margery Tyrell -- but that disturbing death scene stays with us. In George R.R. Martin's \"How To Kill Off Characters\" handbook, Joffrey's proverbial kicking of the bucket ranks as one of the most horrific ways to croak. And now we know, it could happen in real life. Death by poison is a running theme in Martin's books. Slipped into Joffrey's drink was a concoction fittingly named \"the strangler.\" Extracted from the leaves of a plant using lime, the strangler caused its victims to suffocate to death and it wasn't pretty. Violent fits of coughing, inability to breath, spasms, vomiting, hemorrhaging from eye sockets and splotchy skin all wreaked havoc before Joffrey (and the rest of us) realized the end was near. While we were still reeling from the king's cringe-worthy exit, a few scientists decided to do a little investigating to see if his gruesome fictional death could happen in real life. Short answer: Why yes. Yes it can. In the", "You Won\u2019t Believe What David Campese Just Said About England.

So it\u2019s a robotic style.\" (via The Daily Mail) At the beginning of Eddie Jones\u2019 tenure, Campese also argued: \"The whole idea about rugby is playing on the field and entertaining people and getting people to come and watch the game.

Use of marijuana, a psychoactive drug, can come with risks, especially in people who may be prone to addiction or mental illness. And now, for the first time, researchers have found a link between daily decade-long weed use and a difference in how the brain processes reward. For years, researchers have suggested that such a link exists \u2013 and if it does, that it could play a powerful role in addiction. An important part of this line of thought is that addicts, far from amoral individuals incapable of making intelligent decisions, simply respond differently to drugs \u2013 neurologically, psychologically, physiologically \u2013 than people who are not addicted. And this response is probably the result of many factors outside the person's control, including genetics, behaviour, and environment. So for their study, published on Wednesday in the journal Human Brain Mapping, researchers at the Centre for BrainHealth at the University of Texas, Dallas, took a look at the brains of 53 daily long-term pot users (14 of whom met the American Psychiatric Association's criteria for addiction) and 68 people who'd never used the drug daily.

An online Romanian dictionary has found a brilliant though slightly cruel way to deal with cheaters at exams.  SEE ALSO: Oxford wants you to know it's not like the other dictionaries, it's a cool dictionary During a mock test for the National Evaluation last year, the DEX online dictionary noticed a spike in searches for certain words, arising fears that Grade 8 students were using it to cheat.  So this year, during the same preparation exam, they did something radical: they took the three most-searched words and altered the definitions for each one.  The word \"pretutindeni\" means \"everywhere\" but anyone looking up for the word between 9 and 11am last Monday would have found it defined as \"eternal or forever,\" according to the DEX online administrators.  Similarly, \"to spot\" was changed to mean \"to rush.\"  Before the mock test took place, only nine searches for these words were registered. But between 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., hundreds of requests took place. It turns out that both words featured in the exam, in a question that asked students to define their meaning.

His solution? \"Please believe me, here's all you will ever need in the knife department: One good chefs knife, as large as is comfortable for your hand.\" But which one should you buy? Instead of investing in an expensive Henkel or Wusthof knife that requires maintenance that's not realistic for an amateur chef, he recommends opting for a lightweight and inexpensive vanadium steel Global design.

The findings, presented at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, also showed an association between working at a garden shop for at least six months and a higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer. The study is based on data from 1,083 European-American and 1,049 African-American men who had recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The participants were asked about the job they most recently held before the diagnosis, as well as the occupation they spent the longest time working in during their lifetimes. They were also asked whether they had worked in a garden shop, as an animal caretaker, as an exterminator or as a landscaper for more than six months in their lives. While researchers did identify an association between working in a garden shop for more than six months and aggressive prostate cancer, as well as a long period of time spent working as a truck driver and aggressive prostate cancer, they did not find associations between work as an exterminator, landscaper or animal caretaker and aggressive prostate cancer.

In 2012, the Greenville, S.C., school hired Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment (GRACE) to investigate how the university responded to reports of sexual assault, the New York Times reports. The group's findings were set to be released in March. For years there have been allegations that Bob Jones University had been stifling the reporting of sexual assaults, and the school's decision to dismiss GRACE late last month -- mere weeks before its report would be made public -- has therefore been criticized by former students and others affiliated with the school. \"As always, they\u2019re worried about protecting the church and the university, not the victims,\" Camille Lewis, a former Bob Jones student and faculty member, told the New York Times. Others associated with the school said they had always suspected the investigation \"was too good to be true.\" Speaking with local station WYYF News 4, former Bob Jones student Erin Burchwell said she had hoped the GRACE report would validate her allegations.

That means the bulbs will no longer be manufactured or imported once the law goes into effect at the top of the year and that you're going to have to look to some alternatives down the light bulb aisle. The most popular alternative is the compact florescent lights or CFL, known for their long life and high efficiency ratings, but their aesthetic quality and links to cancer have diminished their popularity. Those in favor of the ban point out how much consumers can save with the more efficient bulbs.

Well, feminism refers to a nexus of ideological movements, and applying a strict definition can be constricting if not reductive, but a clear definition explains the term as \"the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.\" The key word here is \"advocacy\" insofar as it encourages the advancement of women. Wait, so are feminists mostly lesbians who don't shave their armpits? I really don't see what about that definition I just gave could possibly make you ask about armpits, but: no. There are hairy lesbian feminists, but the term has literally nothing to do with physical appearance (or lack of shaving). I also heard something about all feminists being pimply sluts. Is that true? Pretty sure you made the pimply part up. Also, no. One major aspect of the feminist movement is the fight against slut-shaming or the oppression of women's ability to express their sexuality in a male-dominated culture. There are a number of double standards, perhaps the most prevalent being the idea that a man who is sexually active is a \"pimp,\" and a woman who is sexually active is a \"whore.\"", "Intel explains how USB-C could be far better than the headphone jack.

The most obvious advantage, at least to devices manufacturers, is slimmer phones. Without needing to route analog circuitry, a phone maker could switch to digital audio and shave off precious millimeters from the device's body. With digital audio, Sanders added, software and device makers could help cheaper earbuds take advantage of features reserved for more expensive headphones, like noise cancelling and bass boosting. Intel has been one of the biggest proponents of USB-C technology Beyond the need for cumbersome adapters, one of the biggest concerns with the loss of the headphone jack is power use.

Super-Earths \u2014 exoplanets slightly larger than Earth \u2014 are common throughout the Milky Way galaxy, but because of their massive gravity, scientists have assumed they should be water worlds. According to a new model, however, tectonically active super-Earths likely store most of their water in the mantle, leaving exposed continents and oceans that could create a stable climate such as that of Earth. \"The temperate climate on Earth is not just because of liquid water, but because of exposed continents,\" study researcher Nicolas Cowan of Northwestern University said here Tuesday (Jan. 7) at the 223rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society. The surface temperatures of continents act as a kind of geological thermostat, stabilizing the climate.

The big planet's gravity would be three times as large as Earth's, squashing the planet's topography by a factor of three and creating shallow ocean basins, researchers said. Given so much water and a shallow place to contain it, conventional wisdom holds that a super-Earth's oceans should overflow their basins and inundate the exoplanet.

Pre-eclampsia \u2013 a condition suffered by 42,000 pregnant women in Britain each year \u2013 is made more likely by noise and pollution from roads, according to a large study. Researchers believe the toxins from vehicles and sound of traffic from nearby roads may increase stress levels and cause inflammation that leads to rising blood pressure associated with the condition. The Danish study of 73,000 women - the first to establish a link between traffic and pre-eclampsia - adds to growing concerns about the health impact of air and noise pollution. Earlier this week a separate study published in the Lancet medical journal warned people who live near roads are also at significantly higher risk of developing dementia. Those concerns add to established evidence that traffic fumes increase the risk of heart disease and asthma. NHS watchdog NICE last month called for urgent action to tackle the problem, warning that air pollution contributes towards 25,000 deaths a year in England - almost 5 per cent of all deaths. Despite overwhelming evidence of health inpacts, the UK has struggled to control air pollution, with 37 cities across Britain persistently breaching legal limits of air toxins set by the EU.

Jason Momoa (the late Khal Drogo) , for example, frequently posts Game of Thrones-related tributes on Instagram, which often confuses the hell out of diehard fans because WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? Is he just sad the show is over for him? Is his character coming back to life? Stop toying with us, Drogo!

This bridge is so crazy that it has recently been given the name \"The Roller Coaster Bridge\" and is catching the eyes of many people who pass by photos of it. The bridge connects the cities of Matsue and Sakaiminato, Japan, and from afar looks like any ordinary bridge that you might find crossing a river. The catch comes in when you learn about the river though. The bridge crosses over a major river which provides access to ports for large ships which means that the bridge had to be built extremely high up so that the ships could pass through underneath with no problems at all. In order to reach a suitable height for the ships, a steep incline is needed to get the cars high up enough before crossing the river which causes the bridge to acquire a terrifying image: This type of structure is absolutely terrifying, and I know that I would not feel happy having to drive up this type of incline!

The report found that Bulgaria was the most affordable country to buy a second home in, with an average price of \u00a390,734.

Based on recent outlooks, however, the reign of these \"masters\" may be coming to an end. Everywhere you look, it appears that doom and gloom is surrounding the industry. From competitors to analysts and even to the managers of hedge funds themselves, everyone is acknowledging that these funds are going through a rough patch. It's all over Let's get the obvious out of the way: Hedge fund performance is abysmal. Funds are underperforming their benchmarks and many are losing investors money. For an industry that is founded on the idea that it can produce alpha, or better returns than the broad market, even being in-line is a disappointment. Hedge funds typically charge high fees to deliver the alpha to their investors. When they're not performing, more attention is paid to these fees. That focus has coincided with the growth of lower-cost alternatives, such as liquid alternatives, which provide hedge fund-like investments with lower fees. Add that up and you've got some problems.

This scene \u2014 sometimes called a stinger \u2014 is one that comes after all the credits have ended and most viewers have left the theater to throw away their empty popcorn bags and head to the car.

Plus, they offer easy access to an on-screen keyboard, and their app interfaces are fast and responsive. The same can't always be said for every TV's operating system, if they even have one at all. What Chromecast manages to achieve is combining this easy-to-use interface with a big-screen TV in a reliably quick and convenient way. There's just one problem, and that's resolution. But there's a good chance that's all about to change. Google has a major press event on October 4, and reports have begun to leak out about the ol' Mountain View team bringing Chromecast into the world of 3,840 x 2,160 Ultra HD resolution. So when will we finally get to see a 4K-equipped Chromecast, and when will it be released? Read on to find out. 4K Chromecast release date We haven't had a firm announcement from Google that the company is even working on a 4K Chromecast, but the fact that the entire industry (including Google's streaming competitors) is moving towards the new resolution means that Google would be crazy to rest on its laurels. Recently, rumors surfaced that the company", "These Dogs Were Stranded During A Massive Flood... But Watch Who Comes To The Rescue! People often have to move quickly when a natural disaster strikes in their neighborhood. As a result, all of their valuable possessions are left behind in the process including their pets. This makes them susceptible to injury or death because they are trapped on their owner\u2019s property while the disaster is striking. Some pet owners who realize their dogs are at home cannot do much about it because they are not able to go back to their property until the disaster is over. Fortunately, a father and son in Brazoria, Texas decided to save the dogs of their town after a big flood struck in their region. They took their small boat out into the flood and traveled around town to pick up all the dogs that they saw which were abandoned. They rescued about 40 dogs and placed them in a temporary animal shelter. Later on, they were reunited with their owners.", "Target in PANIC after getting terrible news. Target\u2019s stock had been dented since the American Family Association\u2019s boycott began amassing signatures in the millions, but we obviously had no way of knowing if people were actually boycotting the store. Target reported earnings this morning, and as it turns out, people made good on their promise. As Reuters reports: Target reported a lower-than-expected increase in quarterly sales at established stores and gave a cautious outlook for the current period, citing volatile weather and weaker demand for electronics and groceries. Shares of the company, which also reported slower digital sales growth, fell more than 9 percent to $66.74 in early trading. Target Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said apparel sales rose during the quarter and were stronger than other retailers\u2019, but big swings in temperature hurt demand in that category. \"We did see a noticeable slowdown post-Easter,\" Smith said on a media conference call. Big swings in temperature? So they\u2019re going to blame climate change? Funny \u2013 they seem to be neglecting the cause of that post-Easter sales slowdown. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and speculate that over 1.2 million boycotters have had an effect.

Now, well into 2017, many start to feel the urgency to kick-start a new healthy eating plan. Some may be aiming to lose weight or tone up. Some may want to fit back into their favorite dress.  Either way, there are some key rules you should follow - and pitfalls you should avoid - to maintain your fresh start.    Chief among them: a binge is a binge, and no amount of next-day fasting will off-set that.  If you want to re-stabilize your health and figure, you need to instill some robust dietary and fitness habits that could, in theory, last a lifetime - not a morning. Here, nutritional therapist Natalie Lamb explains her top five tips to help you achieve your weight loss goals in a healthy way. 1. PROTEIN STAVES OFF HUNGER PANGS The biggest problem when you start to diet is breaking your snacking habit. Over the holidays, as we indulge in cheat day after cheat day, we get used to consuming more calories.  As a result, when you start shrinking your meals down to a healthy, less-indulgent portion, you may feel the urge to nibble between meals.  The best way to", "State's sheriffs are refusing to enforce new gun control laws. Despite this month's ruling from U.S. District Judge Marcia Kreiger saying that the sheriffs don't have legal standing to challenge the laws in their official capacity, Weld County Sheriff John Cooke told The New York Times over the weekend that he and other sheriffs are refusing to enforce the new laws, calling them too vague and a violation of the Second Amendment. Other sheriffs told the newspaper that enforcement of the new gun laws will be \"a very low priority.\" Fifty-five of Colorado's 62 elected sheriffs joined the lawsuit to overturn the new gun laws, which they call unconstitutional. This isn't the first time Cooke has voiced his doubts about the new laws. Back in March, he called them \"unenforceable\" and that they \"give a false sense of security,\" according to the Greeley Tribune. Cooke said that the Democratic lawmakers who passed the laws this year in Colorado are \"uninformed\" and are passing \"knee-jerk reaction\" laws in reaction to the Aurora theater shooting in Colorado and the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut, both in 2012. Despite the sheriffs' refusal to enforce the new laws, Eric Brown, spokesman for Colorado Gov. John W.

The reality star and the Cleveland Cavaliers stud have been spotted all over Los Angeles over the last few days, and on Thursday they were photographed hanging out at a mansion in Beverly Hills. Celebrity website TMZ has photos that show the two of them hanging out at the home. Last weekend, the two were at L.A. hotspot Bootsy Bellows nightclub together and left several minutes apart, avoiding the hoopla of getting photographed together by the awaiting paparazzi. As of now, no one is commenting yet on whether these two are dating or simply friends. Clearly, though, Khloe has an attraction to professional athletes (which she admits). \u00a9 /Rex USA Is Khloe Kardashian dating another NBA star?

The jury's still out on whether Naomi Watts makes a good Princess Di in the upcoming \"Diana\" movie, but we can all certainly agree that the actress is a red carpet expert. As Naomi's promoted her film, she's stepped out in a series of showstopping numbers. For the \"Diana\" Paris premiere, Naomi chose a white tulle empire-waist Marchesa minidress. While we loved the look's light layers and intricate, Marchesa-esque beading, Naomi's long, ruffled bell sleeves threw us for a loop.

The orange-faced one is surely red in the face with embarrassment and rage as Mexicans publicly make a loser out of the profane bigot who dreams of building border walls at Mexico\u2019s expense. There is little doubt that the racist Republican\u2019s presidential campaign has cost the vulgarian\u2019s company the prestigious PGA Cadillac Championship tournament at Trump Doral Resort, home to the famed Blue Monster. Mexican conglomerate Grupo Salinas has picked up sponsorship when no American corporation would, and the television production and financial service behemoth got the golf tournament location they wanted in return: Mexico City. As the Miami Herald reports, it\u2019s highly unusual to be unable to replace a sponsor in America\u2019s televised professional sports leagues: Losing a title sponsor, whether of a sporting venue or event these days, defines common. Being unable to replace one, especially for a popular golf tournament with international reach and a half-century of history, defines uncommon. Even in the economically stretched times of 2009-10, the PGA signed lucrative sponsor agreements. Now, the tournament seems headed on the other side of a border on which Trump declares he wants to build a wall. The PGA needs a clean break from the sport\u2019s less than glorious", "People are really, really hoping this theory about David Cameron and Brexit is true. Political commentators forecast a dark future for the UK: Jeremy Corbyn has just sacked Hilary Benn to head off a coup, and Boris Johnson could be prime minister come November. David Cameron\u2019s decision to resign before enacting Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets out how a country could leave the EU, may have much bigger implications for Conservative hopefuls eyeing up the Prime Minister's seat than they bargained for. While panic ensues, one person\u2019s musings in the comments section of thehas an interesting hypothesis on these complications: If Boris Johnson looked downbeat yesterday, that is because he realises that he has lost. Perhaps many Brexiters do not realise it yet, but they have actually lost, and it is all down to one man: David Cameron. With one fell swoop yesterday at 9:15 am, Cameron effectively annulled the referendum result, and simultaneously destroyed the political careers of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and leading Brexiters who cost him so much anguish, not to mention his premiership. How? Throughout the campaign, Cameron had repeatedly said that a vote for leave would lead to triggering Article 50 straight away. Whether implicitly or explicitly, the image was clear: he would be giving that notice", "Are All Of Nando's UK Branches Closing Because Britain Has Left The EU? Right, listen.

But a driver escaping from a pursuit is much more rare. And it appeared to happen Friday \u2014 at least for a while. Authorities \u2014 and TV news helicopters \u2014 were tracking a man in a car stolen in Lakewood. The man drove recklessly for nearly an hour, hitting an armored car and another vehicle. At one point, he looked up and waved at TV choppers broadcasting the chase. He ended up in the hills above Whittier, along Turnbull Canyon Road. See the most-read stories this hour >> There, he slowed his vehicle in a tree-covered section of the road. As the Honda Accord kept moving, he climbed almost imperceptibly out of the driver\u2019s window. The vehicle coasted to a stop farther down the road. It appeared the man might have gotten away. But minutes later, the man, who was wearing a Tony Romo Dallas Cowboys football jersey, was taken into custody, his mad scramble for freedom stopped short. Authorities have not identified the man or said whether anyone was hurt during his two accidents. Some chase observers gave the man points for ingenuity because his escape was difficult to see live. His slick move was visible only in slow-motion replays", "18th Century Woman Shocked All of England By Giving Birth to Rabbits. Yes, rabbits! Apparently, Mistress Toft eschewed the traditional pulling-a-rabbit-out-a-hat trick, and decided to pull not only one....but several...out of her baby-hole. Mary Toft and one of her...children. The story began when a pregnant Toft, who was working in the fields with other women in her community, sighted a rabbit bounding from the undergrowth, and was filled with such longing for the furry, little creature, she could not think of anything but rabbits. A month later, she was delivered of a strange creature resembling a rabbit, but with its heart and lungs outside its body. It so alarmed her midwife, who immediately informed surgeon and man-midwife, John Howard. Initially skeptical, Howard examined Toft, and was shocked when the peasant women expelled a creature from her body made up of several animal parts, including the legs and guts of a cat, one leg of a rabbit, and the backbone of an eel. Fourteen days later, she delivered even more, this time full, perfectly-formed rabbits, bringing forth a total of six rabbits into the world, all of which were either dead, or died soon after delivery. Now imagine these furry fluffies as Mary Toft\u2019s children, only dead. Her case took the countryside by storm,", "4 Surprising Ways You're Hurting Your Bike. Not Washing Your Bike  This is especially important if you use your bottle cage for sugary drinks that might slosh onto the frame. Bike + sticky, sugary liquid = gradual disaster in the form of deteriorated shifting from sugar collecting at the bottom bracket. It\u2019s better to clean it off before disaster strikes. A regular cleaning will also remove any buildup of dirt in the drivetrain to keep it spinning smoothly. Plus, cleaning your bike involves examining it up close, which gives you the opportunity to find minor damage before it becomes major. Clean your bike every time you get it dirty\u2014and even if you don\u2019t get it dirty, clean it every 20 to 25 rides. Using Too Much Chain Lube  Overcoating your chain with lube could turn it into a giant revolving grime magnet\u2014collecting dirt and dust that will slow you down and ultimately accelerate wear on the whole drivetrain.

A bad hire can be financially costly to your company and set back your team's progress. There's an enormous burden on managers tasked with determining what their team needs and then making a judgment call on who can fill that role, within a relatively short period of time. Experience, intelligence, and determination are all important aspects to consider when looking at a job candidate, but the primary focus needs to be on talent, argue Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman in their classic management guide, \" First, Break All the Rules .\" When the book was first published in 1999, Buckingham told Business Insider, it was controversial for its conclusion that the best managers develop their employees' strengths and ignore their weaknesses, since the prevailing wisdom was that bosses should amass a team of well-rounded individuals always correcting their shortcomings. The coauthors' conclusions weren't based on intuition, but rather 25 years of Gallup studies of 80,000 managers across 400 companies. Over time, more companies began adopting Buckingham and Coffman's prescribed approach, and now companies like Facebook operate entirely on their philosophy. Facebook HR chief Lori Goler recommends their book to all new managers In their book, Buckingham and Coffman define talent as", "Now that Coachella is over what will Vanessa Hudgens do?

Comedy duo par excellence Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein recruited photographer Alex Prager for the job, riffing off her most recent series \"A Face In The Crowd.\" Prager's sharp-edged, cinematic shots capture the hustle and bustle of an anonymous crowd, emphasizing the bizarre juxtaposition of physical proximity and mental distance. In the \"Portlandia\" photos, Prager replaces her signature medley of ambiguously retro costumes with an assortment of Portland-esque stereotypes, ripe with vintage prints, handlebar mustaches and a heavy dose of plaid. Prager's images, stylized to the brink of surrealism, perfectly compliment Armisen and Brownstein's affirmative and absurd brand of humor. We reached out to Armisen to discuss Prager's work and ended up discovering his goal is to be Cindy Sherman. Needless to say, our minds were blown. Read on. Were you familiar with Alex's work before the shoot? A little bit, but Carrie was more familiar with it. And I'm glad, because nothing is more rewarding than finding out about a new artist. It is such a nice thing, such a nice part about life, getting to know an artist. Although, that being said, when I first saw her work I had the feeling I had seen it before.

Melissa McCarthy is Abby Yates, Kristen Wiig is Erin Gilbert, Kate McKinnon is Jillian Holtzmann and Leslie Jones is Patty Tolan. Some fans have been trying to match up the new characters with the original Ghostbusters, Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spenger (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson). However, we have to keep in mind that this is a Ghostbusters reboot, and not a straight-up remake. So these characters won\u2019t have the exactsame traits as the original team.

My experience was worlds away from the millions of Americans who live with limited income day in and day out \u2014 after all, I did have a safety net of savings and my challenge had a 30-day \"timer\" on it \u2014 but it gave me a small glimpse of what it's like to make ends meet with limited income in an expensive city. One of the biggest, most surprising takeaways had nothing to do with dollars, cents, or budgets: There is a lot of pressure to spend in social scenarios ... and it's hard to say no. It seems painfully obvious now, but before living on $8.15 an hour \u2014 which allowed me $150 of discretionary spending money for the month after meeting living expenses like rent \u2014 I simply didn't notice (or chose to ignore) how friends and family can influence your spending habits. Sure, I was aware of how incredibly easy it is to spend money in a city, but what became more and more evident was how much pressure there is to spend. It's not even the money itself that's the problem. It's the social stigma of opting out.

A war is brewing in memedom, and it could not possibly be more absurd: In the various online fan groups devoted to garlic bread, fierce arguments have broken out over ... gender. The drama first kicked off over the weekend, when the wildly popular Facebook page Garlic Bread Memes posted an image macro that many have interpreted as transphobic. (How popular could the page possibly be, you ask? Well, more than a quarter-million people currently subscribe to it.) The meme depicted two pieces of garlic bread with the caption \"if I had a slice of garlic bread for every existing gender.\" [A woman came up with this clever meme. Men quickly pretended the idea was theirs.] The implication, many readers assumed, is that the page\u2019s administrators rejected gender identities beside male and female. And that promptly ignited hundreds of outraged posts in the comments, as well as on Reddit and Instagram, where the meme is similarly well-followed. Critics were aghast that a slice of bread would take such a position. \"I am surprised by the scale of the reaction,\" said the Garlic Bread Memes\u2019 main administrator, who identified himself as an 18-year-old Israeli high-schooler named Boaz. \"But [I\u2019m not surprised] about", "Before You Spend $26,000 on Weight-Loss Surgery, Do This. At our obesity clinics, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of patients who, after cutting down on carbohydrates, lose weight and get off their medications. One patient in his 50s was a brick worker so impaired by diabetes that he had retired from his job. He came to see one of us last winter, 100 pounds overweight and panicking. He\u2019d been taking insulin prescribed by a doctor who said he would need to take it for the rest of his life. Yet even with insurance coverage, his drugs cost hundreds of dollars a month, which he knew he couldn\u2019t afford, any more than he could bariatric surgery. Instead, we advised him to stop eating most of his meals out of boxes packed with processed flour and grains, replacing them with meat, eggs, nuts and even butter. Within five months, his blood-sugar levels had normalized, and he was back to working part-time. Today, he no longer needs to take insulin. Another patient, in her 60s, had been suffering from Type 2 diabetes for 12 years. She lost 35 pounds in a year on a low-carb diet, and was able to stop taking her three medications, which included more than 100 units of insulin daily. hemoglobin", "After all this time, we may finally know who let the dogs out.

Lead researcher Michael Allan is the director of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Alberta. He and his colleagues reviewed more than 80 studies on vitamin D, looking for support for claims that the vitamin can reduce cancer risk, treat arthritis, and more. The team was somewhat surprised by their results; \"Even areas that we really thought there was good evidence for benefit early on, don't seem to be bearing out,\" Allan said in a press statement. In other words, we should rein in our enthusiasm for a \"vitamin D panacea,\" as the authors call it. The results showed insufficient evidence for eight popular beliefs about vitamin D supplementation: That it can treat depression; That it can treat rheumatoid arthritis; That it can treat multiple sclerosis; That it can prevent respiratory tract infections; That it lowers cancer risk and mortality; That it reduces overall mortality; That taking a higher dose is better; and That healthy adults should get their vitamin D levels checked regularly.

Florey says it\u2019s essential to shampoo twice, rinsing in between, and your hair will be transformed if you do. \"The hair will become a lot stronger, shinier and healthier,\" he says, but adds that the improvement won\u2019t be instantaneous and it", "Does the ref have it in for your team? In the fourth quarter of the Oct. 29 football game between No. 3 Clemson and 12th-ranked Florida State, the Seminoles were thinking upset. FSU led 28-26 when star tailback Dalvin Cook ripped off a 50-yard run into Clemson territory. Then came a penalty flag for an illegal block, negating the play. FSU Coach Jimbo Fisher stormed the sideline, screaming at the officials, dropping an apparent F-bomb. Then came another flag, for unsportsmanlike conduct. FSU punted. Clemson escaped with a 37-34 win. Fisher resumed his tantrum at a postgame press conference, blasting the game\u2019s officials as \"gutless\" and \"wrong.\" Eyes bulging, Fisher said, \"You hold coaches accountable [and] players accountable\u2014hold the damn officials accountable.\" The Atlantic Coast Conference, which includes both FSU and Clemson, later fined Fisher $20,000. Blaming the zebras is hardly novel.

Near the beginning of new film The Childhood of a Leader, a young boy is learning to speak French. At the end of the exercise, his teacher, a prim but gentle Stacy Martin, tells him how well he is doing, and the boy, with eyes as hard as diamonds, purposefully places his hand on her breast. \"My mother lets me do it all the time,\" he tells her. We're in Versailles, France, in the aftermath of the First World War. The boy's American father, we learn, is helping negotiate the peace terms with Germany. His mother, in public, is distant and cold, leaving her son to the passing whims of nurses, maids, and tutors.

During an appearance on the BBC's Graham Norton Show on Friday, Lawrence told Norton exactly how she felt about The Donald. Apparently, the two powerhouse public figures were both attending the same concert one evening.

As we fill the dishwasher's utensil basket over the course of several days, we arrange utensils by type as they go in. Have ice cream for a snack after dinner? The spoon goes with the rest of the spoons when you put it in the dishwasher. Grab a knife to make a sandwich? Toss it into the knife compartment of the basket. This way, when everything's clean and ready to be unloaded, you don't have to sort. You just grab each utensil group by the fistful and put it right into the drawer. This part of unloading the dishwasher used to be the most cumbersome to me until we worked out this (seemingly obvious) system in our household. Have you been practicing this simple tip forever?

The flirtatious meetings between the two have set social media alight as the pair spent a number of hours together. They were pictured together after the 25-year-old came first in the 100 metre freestyle with the Prince, 31, seemingly mesmerised by her leg-length tattoo. They then shared a moving moment when Sergeant Marks gave Harry back the medal - one of four golds she won in the pool - asking him instead to deliver it to doctors and nurses at the British hospital that saved her life. Sergeant Marks clearly found Harry hilarious as they were seen joking and laughing together as he tried on one of her US team tops. \"As soon as they met they just hit it off,\" said a spectator. \"Sergeant Marks is extremely attractive and Harry clearly took a little bit of a shine to her after all what she has achieved. \"But when she asked for her medal to be given to doctors and nurses who saved her life back home he, like all of us, was bowled over.\" The next day they met", "Bernie Sanders just achieved one final victory in the presidential race.

The draft language agreed to Sunday morning includes an endorsement to support \"every tool available to reduce emissions now,\" which most significantly includes an endorsement for pricing carbon. \"Democrats believe that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases should be priced to reflect their negative externalities, and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and help meet our climate goals,\" the draft reads.", "New year's resolutions: How to lose the fat and get fit for free #HappyNewYear. Walking is underrated as a form of exercise, but it's one of the easiest ways to get more activity into your day, lose weight and become healthier. Research shows that people who fit moderate activity, such as walking, into their daily life burn more energy than those who make weekly visits to the gym. Try to fit walking into your routine by ditching the car for short journeys, walking all or part of your journey to work, getting off the bus or train one stop early and planning longer walks at the weekends. To reap the health benefits, aim to walk 10,000 steps a day, which can burn up to 400 calories. To keep track of your walking, use a pedometer.

In actuality this exercise puts unnecessary stress on the shoulders. It is not a natural position for the arms to be in. Instead just do regular dips. They are safer and work out the entire arm and not just the triceps. Another alternative to tricep bench dips is the triangle push-up. It targets not only the triceps, but also engages muscles in your chest, shoulders and core. 2. Crunches Many people think the crunch is the ultimate ab exercise. Its not. The crunch only works out the top of the abs. So if you are looking for six pack abs and want to get rid of those love handles, this exercise is not going to cut it. In addition, it causes back and neck problems and thats the last thing anyone wants. Try the plank as a alternative. The plank decreases the risk of lower back pain as your get older, as an extra bonus to rock hard abs. 3.

Believe it or not, Donald Trump has now made a very important policy statement. Introducing what he billed as an \"energy plan,\" Trump promised to \"cancel the Paris Climate Plan.\" Unlike so much of what comes from Trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous long-term implications. The near-term political consequences of this will \u2014 or should \u2014 be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don\u2019t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it\u2019s likely Sanders will see it this way, too. To get all the details on Trump\u2019s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer\u2019s piece.

As the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can. In some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move. But the question remains: Why on Earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables? To be fair, there aren\u2019t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it\u2019s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that\u2019s frightening, not the cucumber itself: An unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring.

First, you have to mentally prepare. \"I don't normally think of myself as sexy, but when I put the AP lingerie on I felt very sexy -- in control, seductive and powerful,\" Wiedemann told Harper's Bazaar UK. \"It\u2019s kind of like a superhero suit, albeit quite a skimpy one!\" Surely, the famous foodie -- Wiedemann hosts an online cooking series for Vogue called \"Elettra's Goodness\" -- had to change her lifestyle a little as well. She explains: \"To prepare I did extra strength work, so weights, and quite a few planks for my core. My diet stayed pretty much the same, except I cut out sugar for the week of the shoot.\" That doesn't sound too bad, especially when you consider the egg powder diet some of her lingerie modeling peers take on before a gig. Thankfully, gals like Wiedemann and Victoria's Secret model Lindsay Ellingson, who actually adds fat to her diet to be \"sexier and curvier\" for the", "Get ready for ANOTHER royal baby! The news comes just 12 weeks after the couple's glitzy Stockholm wedding. A statement on the Swedish royal court's website confirmed that Madeleine is due in March 2014, which means she's about two months along. Currently third in line to the throne, the princess lives in New York with her financier husband. He decided to eschew an official royal title before they were married, so we're not sure where that will leave the baby. As of now, Crown Princess Victoria's daughter Estelle is currently the second in line to the throne. Unlike many royals, Madeleine's known as a working woman and will continue her nonprofit work for the World Childhood Foundation as well as her royal engagements during her pregnancy. We're sure Kate Middleton would have a few words of wisdom for the expectant mother when it comes to keeping up with royal duties while with child. Not to mention Prince Harry and Madeleine's brother, Prince Carl-Philip, will surely bond over being the \"cool\" uncles in the family. But the best part, aside from the cuteness that will be the new Swedish royal baby? More maternity fashion. Grattis, Madeleine and Christopher!", "You won't believe what this locksmith found after cracking open an abandoned safe. A stash of several boxes of gold coins, as well as jewelry and silver, were found Monday in an old concrete-lined safe in Houston, Texas, KPRC reports. The safe was brought to a locksmith by a customer who had been entrusted with it by relatives of its late owner. Opening it, however, took several weeks. \"Sometimes it gives up easy; sometimes you've got to work at it,\" locksmith Robbie Rivera told KTRK-TV. \"I was going to get some C4.\" Law enforcement arrived shortly to take custody of the treasure before the interested parties, including the late owner's estate, divvied up the spoils.

In May, an abandoned safe in Tennessee yielded pocket watches, soggy money, jewelry and collectible silver coins.", "Is the teen brain more vulnerable to addiction? The Fix: I wanted to start where the book starts, talking about some of the misconceptions and myths about adolescence. How do you think those misconceptions shape people's opinions of drug and alcohol abuse in adolescence? Daniel Siegel: The myths have made it so that our understanding of adolescence is misguided. We think of raging hormones, that adolescence is a period of immaturity. We think that some of the behaviors are just a function of impulsivity, when in fact there are other truths that are really more accurate. The first thing is that these myths disempower the adolescents, and really disempower the adults to have a deeper understanding of how adolescence is really a time not of immaturity but of [brain] remodeling. And part of what goes on with remodeling is getting the individual ready to leave home. And that's actually a really good thing. But there are parts that don't function quite as well, so that's part of the emotionality of this period \u2014 not that it's immaturity, but really that it's a remodeling. Part of what allows the adolescent to get ready to leave home is this remodeling that includes a change in the dopamine system.

The LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause. In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains have been made in recent years. More and more states in America are legalizing same-sex marriage and are opening their doors, hearts, and minds to same-sex couples. Still, it is difficult for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to be taken seriously or treated with respect in some places. There are still people out there who turn these individuals away from their homes and businesses, but with the help of organizations and groups that promote acceptance and tolerance, circumstances can shift. We are going to name 15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn\u2019t Know Came Out in 2016, so that you can see just how many celebs are taking a stand for this community. You may know of some actors, musicians, and authors who have come out as gay (think Wanda Sykes and Zachary Quinto), but there may be other famous people you didn\u2019t know identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay, or somewhere else on the spectrum.

According to the New York Post, Manziel went missing over the weekend when he was supposed to meet friends and family for a \"small party in the Hamptons.\" He didn't show up for a helicopter ride (?) and ultimately got left. When you skip out on a Hamptons party and a helicopter ride and people are worried about your life, well, it's reasonable to wonder if everything is alright.

The size put it in the class of proto-planetary asteroids, objects large enough to be the likely precursors of planets.

That much was clear from the second I signed up for the service last fall. And now, after having personally used Fi for the better part of a year, I'm finding new ways it can make my life easier. Project Fi, if you aren't familiar, is Google's experimental wireless service for its own Nexus devices. It seamlessly switches your phone between a handful of networks -- Sprint, T-Mobile, and as of recently, U.S. Cellular -- to get you the best possible signal at any given time. It also taps into reliable public Wi-Fi networks (with its own layer of encryption in place) and uses those for your calls and data whenever it can. You pay only for the data you use each month -- at the same flat rate, even if you're roaming in a different country. It's an unusual arrangement that won't make sense for everyone, but if you're anything like me and my family, it could end up saving you some serious moolah. But hold the phone: There's more to Fi than just those basic benefits. Late last year, Google added an option for Fi subscribers to get data-only SIM cards that are tied to existing accounts.

The results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint. Conducting the study The University of Chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. The researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. The researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm. After the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. They included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food.

Robert's girlfriend had faced a traumatic death that occurred in her family. Robert tried to support her as much he could, and wanted to cheer her up. As time passed by, the frequency of their sexual intercourse went lower, until their sex life has died completely. Robert, like many others was not ready for this change in relationship, and thought he was to blame as the cause of their lack of sex. Robert thought he wasn't attractive anymore, or doing something wrong.

As one patient explained, \"the more I try not to think about work, the more I think about work.\" Another patient dreads the downtime: \"I miss the high energy of being at the office.\" A third patient rejects the notion of being told what to do: \"I told my wife, I cannot be told to relax on command.\" Downtime is challenging, not because they are workaholics but because they are used to having their minds occupied all the time. They never take any time to pause, to reflect, or to just think. Life is nonstop. Even when they are not busy their minds are occupied. They listen to a podcast on the way to work. They listen to the news while in the shower. They listen to music while jogging through the park. They watch TV before bed. Every free moment is filled. Their mobile device is a go-to time filler.

When you buy an apple, a bag of potatoes or an orange, you probably are under the impression that these fresh fruits and vegetables have only been washed clean before being stacked neatly in the produce section. In addition to the chemicals used to grow produce, there are a host of post harvest chemicals and colorants applied: on the field, in washing water, in transport, in storage and in packaging. Unlike processed foods, there is no label on fresh food that tells us what they are. Commonly used chemicals Sodium orthophenylphenate (SOPP) How it is used: Fungicide which prevents or delays the appearance of rota and molds on produce. Thiabendazole (TBZ) How it is used: Thiabendazole is used as a fungicide to control green mold, blue mold, and stem end rot on citrus fruits. It controls Cercospora leaf spot on sugar beets; crown rot on bananas; bluemold rot, bully eye rot, and gray mold on apples and pears; black rot, scurf and foot rot on sweet potatoes; and to control Fusarium (dry rot) in potato storage. It can be used on soybeans to reduce the severity of pod and stem blight such as anthracnose, brown spot, frogeye leaf spot and purple", "What to do with your hair when it's blistering cold.

The Tousled Side Braid This braided look (recently spotted on Chloe Moretz) is perfect for beginners. Plus, you can put on a hat and not worry about it messing up your look once you take it off. Use dry shampoo to build texture and keep your hair from getting greasy. Then pull strands over to one side and twist or braid them to the very end. Use an elastic ponytail holder to secure. The Fishtail Braid We wouldn't have made it through summer without the fishtail braid, and we can trust that it will take us right through winter. When you want to keep those flyaways in check, try a sleek fishtail braid ponytail like this one worn by Selena Gomez. Hair serum will hold the braid together.

Albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city\u2019s successful \"There\u2019s a Better Way\" program, which hires panhandlers to work in maintenance jobs and also aims to connect them with services. Albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city\u2019s successful \"There\u2019s a Better Way\" program. (Albuquerque Mayor's Office) Republican Mayor Richard Berry was driving around Albuquerque last year when he saw a man on a street corner holding a sign that read: \"Want a Job. Anything Helps.\" Throughout his administration, as part of a push to connect the homeless population to services, Berry had taken to driving through the city to talk to panhandlers about their lives. His city\u2019s poorest residents told him they didn\u2019t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn\u2019t know where else to go. Seeing that sign gave Berry an idea. Instead of asking them, many of whom feel dispirited, to go out looking for work, the city could bring the work to them. Next month will be the first anniversary of Albuquerque\u2019s There\u2019s a Better Way program, which hires panhandlers for day jobs beautifying the city.

For that bit of boilerplate, we can indirectly thank none other than Grigori Rasputin, the famously hard-to-assassinate Russian mystic and intimate of the last, doomed Romanovs. It all started when an exiled Russian prince sued MGM in 1933 over the studio\u2019s Rasputin biopic, claiming that the American production did not accurately depict Rasputin\u2019s murder. And the prince ought to have known, having murdered him. Here\u2019s the story. In 1916, the fabulously wealthy, Oxford-educated Prince Felix Yusupov was one of several Russian aristocrats agonizing over the unseemly influence that Rasputin\u2014the magical healer, charismatic lech, and peasant\u2014had over the czar and, particularly, the czarina. In December, Yusupov invited Rasputin to his palace, where he offered him cyanide-laced cakes and then shot him. Although the czarina was distraught, the czar let Yusupov off lightly, exiling the prince and his wife Irina.

This article originally appeared in Vulture. Are we currently experiencing the best fall TV season in several years? Considering the reception that has greeted many of 2016\u2019s new network, cable, and streaming series, it certainly feels that way, which is a little unusual. Typically, as we inch toward the beginning of October, professional and nonprofessional TV viewers are more likely to be criticizing network executives\u2019 programming decisions and placing bets on how many heavily hyped fall shows will make it past Christmas, not drowning in more great comedies and dramas than they can handle. That\u2019s not to say that bets about which fall show will be canceled first have stopped being placed. (For the record, my money is on Notorious, which got bad reviews and terrible ratings in its first week on the air.) But as a critic sifting through so many just-out-of-the-oven scripted episodes, I have, so far, seen a lot more that I liked, or even loved, than I hated. Is it because TV is, overall, better than it was two, three, or five years ago? Well, yes and no.

When you feel stressed or anxious, adrenaline courses through your veins, your heart beats at a rapid rate, and your breathing becomes quick and shallow. So before I get into the specifics behind how the trick works, I wanted to explain in my own words what it feels like when you try it. To me, the effect of the breathing technique feels almost like a sedative drug, because in order to hold your breath for seven seconds and then to exhale for eight\u2014when your breath is so shallow and short\u2014your body is forced to slow your heart rate. It has no choice. Holding your breath and then slowly, deliberately exhaling for eight seconds causes a chain reaction. It feels like going from a mad-dash sprint to a finish line to a slow, leisurely, calming stroll through the park. When you first start, you'll be desperate to just take in another breath, or you'll want to speed up your counting, but if you stick to the numbers (or at least try to) and don't take any breaks (in other words, consecutively repeat the 4-7-8 without resuming regular breathing), you can literally feel your heart rate slow down, your mind get quieter, and", "Xbox One's Terraria Facing This \"Serious Issue\".

Former UN under-secretary general Dr Shashi Tharoor said the British education system fails to tell the real story of empire. He said: \"There's no real awareness of the atrocities, of the fact that Britain financed its Industrial Revolution and its prosperity from the depredations of empire, the fact that Britain came to one of the richest countries in the world in the 18th century and reduced it, after two centuries of plunder, to one of the poorest.\" A previous YouGov poll found the British public are generally proud of the British Empire and its colonial past. YouGov found 44 per cent were proud of Britain's history of colonialism, while 21 per cent regretted it happened. The same poll also found 43 per cent believed the British Empire was a good thing, while 19 per cent said it was bad and 25 per cent said it was neither good nor bad.  At its height in 1922, the British empire governed a fifth of the world's population and a quarter of the world's total land area.

While some cars require premium gas, many others simply carry a recommendation to use it. We wanted to see whether you can save money by using regular gas in cars that merely carry the recommended premium fuel label. Testing at the Consumer Reports Track To find out whether using regular gas in a vehicle that recommends premium gas had any effect on fuel economy or acceleration, we evaluated two models: the 2015 Acura TLX four-cylinder and the 2016 Nissan Maxima V6.

The French Government earlier this year warned parents to stop posting images of their children on social media networks. Under France's rigorous privacy laws, parents could face penalties of up to a year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros ($65,500) if convicted of publicising intimate details of their children without their consent. This new legality is powerful food for thought for parenting in the Facebook era. As adults, we often express dissatisfaction at the ways young people post their lives online. But if we turn the mirror on ourselves, do we as parents actually have the right to make our family photos public? If so, which ones? Part of the issue is our tendency for over-sharing. A recent study by Nominet, which handles the UK's .uk domain name registry, found parents post nearly 200 photos of their under fives online every year. This means that a child will feature in about 1,000 online photos before their fifth birthday. We have even got to the point where if you don't upload photos of your baby, others question whether you are a committed parent. This new norm means many children will have a powerful digital identity created by someone else. This", "@Lordemusic on her \"holy crap\" moment.

Unfortunately for Ghostbusters, the film won't benefit from that lucrative cash cow, as the country has denied the film's release. This isn't unprecedented. Movies have had issues in the past getting released in China if they contained references to Ghosts as well as heightened levels of violence. Films like Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Deadpool have struggled to get released in the territory for various reasons, but there may be a bit more to it than originally believed. One thing to note is that both of the original Ghostbuster films did not release in China, which according to THR sources, is actually the reason why the film is not being allowed to debut. \"It's been confirmed that Ghostbusters won't be coming to China because they think it's not really that attractive to Chinese audiences,\" says one Chinese executive. \"Most of the Chinese audience didn't see the first and second movies, so they don't think there's much market for it here.\" To a degree it makes sense.

He doesn't want to scrap the Constitution. He doesn't romanticize violence itself as a vital cleansing agent of society.

For one thing, the U.S. is still overwhelmingly religious, despite years of predictions about religion\u2019s demise. A significant number of people who don\u2019t identify with any particular faith group still say they believe in God , and roughly 40 percent pray daily or weekly.

Avoid becoming a busy fool: It is very easy to become very busy doing things that are a huge drain on time but have little or no end value. For example, taking on too many projects that are unlikely to come to anything. Invest wisely: Don\u2019t invest in anything unless you are prepared to put at least 10 per cent of your net worth into it: Some people invest in lots of little things with the belief that it might be a good investment, but when it comes down to it are not that sure. If you are not confident enough to be prepared to invest 10 per cent of your net worth into it, then avoid it. So before investing a little into something, don\u2019t ask yourself can you afford to lose this small amount, ask if this is something you would actually be", "Sole Foods Street Farms opens North America's largest urban orchard. Earlier this year, a Canadian nonprofit called Sole Food Street Farms took an old gas station and turned it into the largest urban orchard in North America. Sole Food transforms vacant spaces into sources of sustenance and livelihood for the Vancouver community. \"We believe healthy food systems foster healthy communities,\" their website states. \"We envision a future where good food is accessible and grown sustainably, where farms thrive in an urban setting and where the community comes together to connect directly with their food and their neighbors.\" Its newest farm was previously a Petro-Canada gas station in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, an area known as Canada's poorest postal code, according to Fast Company. Sole Foods reopened the site as an urban garden in July, and the formerly vacant lot now has 500 fruit trees that will go a long way toward producing the 60 tons of fresh produce that Sole Foods expects to net this year between its four existing sites. In addition to producing artisan quality fruits and vegetables for local markets and restaurants, Sole Foods aims to employ nontraditional farmers -- individuals, for example, who may have struggled with addiction or mental illness and are looking for ways to turn", "The one place this Google executive won't take her phone. I\u2019ve been taking ballet all my life since I was very young, and while I did spend time during high school as part of a company, it has mostly been a lifelong hobby. As an undergraduate [at Howard University], at Harvard Business School, and as I moved to different cities -- Denver, Boston, Detroit, New York -- I'd always find a ballet studio. It just brings me so much joy to dance. To me, a sacred space should really be where you can practice something that brings you pure joy. And something that helps you celebrate what it is to be human. In this case, ballet is all about the human body and what you can do with the human body in a graceful way. Something about having the barre, the wooden floor, the pianist, the instructor, made me feel as though all else was outside. It became this sacred space. And though it was a place that was all my own -- where I could challenge and test myself -- it was also a collaboration with others, because truly you dance together, not by yourself.

The photo app is finally rolling out its new algorithmic timeline, which orders your feed based on \"what you care about\" rather than chronology. The changes should appear \"soon,\" though Instagram says it's already live for many users. The update will make Instagram feeds much more similar to Facebook's, with users seeing posts based on factors like popularity and other social signals, rather than strictly chronologically. The change, which Instagram first announced in March, has proved to be controversial among Instagram's user base, who worry that their followers may not see their posts. But in a blog post Friday, the company said that people who have had access to the new timeline have been more engaged with posts than with the old timeline. \"With this new ordering you won\u2019t miss your favorite band\u2019s video after the concert, even if it took place across the world in a different time zone,\" the company says. \"And no matter how many accounts you follow, you should see your best friend\u2019s latest posts.\" Of course, as with any big Instagram change, the feed change has sparked mixed reactions.

Hirshberg also mentioned the fact that even Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 received negative responses initially but went on to become the best selling Call of Duty game ever. Black Ops 2 was also disregarded by fans before release because of the futuristic setting of the game. \"Our previous most-disliked trailer was the reveal trailer for Black Ops 2,\" Hirshberg said. \"[That was] the first", "You Won\u2019t Believe the Food That Has Quickly Replaced Tobacco as The Most Popular Currency in US Prisons.

At the prison used for the study, a package of ramen runs for 59 cents at the commissary, but at inmate stores, which are illegal, they can go for much more. A sweatshirt that costs $10.81 can be traded for two packs of ramen. Prisoners also clean each others bunks for packs of ramen, or gamble with it. The change is a signifier of a major problem with nutrition in prisons. \"[Money] doesn\u2019t change unless there\u2019s some drastic change to the value in people using it,\" Gibson-Light said.

At the urging of USA Swimming officials, she said, Knutson turned down a college scholarship and entrusted her career to the Olympic national governing body for the sport. And then it all went awry.

While most people assume nail biting has to do with nerves or anxiety, one study is linking this bad habit to a surprising personality trait. According to a study published in the March 2015 issue of Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, nail biters are more likely to be perfectionists. Now, you may expect someone who aims for perfection to have immaculately polished nails, but that's not the case, says Dr. Kieron O'Conner, the study's author. Perfectionists are often so focused on results, that they aren't able to relax, and they overwork themselves. \"They are therefore prone to frustration, impatience, and dissatisfaction when they do not reach their goals,\" she explained. And that can lead to nail biting, apparently. The researchers had a group of 48 people, half of them chronic nail biters, fill out surveys that evaluated their \"experienced emotions.\" They were then exposed to situations designed to provoke specific feelings, such as stress and boredom. In the end, they concluded that perfectionists are more likely to feel restless when there's nothing to do, and biting their nails is an outlet for this impatience. The bottom line?

The Massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban Congress allowed to expire in 2004. It prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the Colt AR-15 and AK-47 and explicitly bans \"copies or duplicates\" of those weapons. But gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" weapon is. They market \"state compliant\" copycat versions of their assault weapons to Massachusetts buyers. They sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. That will end now. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. With this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. The directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" of a prohibited weapon. If a gun\u2019s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a", "Red white and blue took over NYC's Fifth Avenue on Sunday.

And It's Amazing. Dr. Robert Ballard couldn\u2019t sleep. It was the early morning of September 1, 1985, and the 43-year-old oceanographer was lying in his bunk aboard the research vessel Knoor. Ballard had led the ship to the North Atlantic in search of the long-lost wreck of Titanic, but despite combing the seafloor for more than a week, his team\u2019s camera-outfitted robot had yet to find anything other than miles of sand and sediment. With only a few days left before the mission ended, he was beginning to worry the iconic \"Ship of Dreams\" might never be found.  As Ballard tried to distract himself with a book, the Knoor\u2019s cook appeared and said the on-duty watch team had called for him. Ballard pulled a jumpsuit over his pajamas and dashed to the ship\u2019s control van. When he arrived, his colleagues replayed what had just appeared on their robot\u2019s live video feed of the seafloor. The footage was dim and grainy, but the metal object it showed was unmistakable: one of Titanic\u2019s boilers. Ballard and his crew erupted with cheers and applause.

A recent report published in December\u2019s issue of the American Sociological Review finds that students in schools with high rates of suspensions suffer academically -\u2013 even if they are not being suspended themselves. The report, compiled by University of Indiana professor Brea Perry and University of Kentucky professor Edward Morris, concludes that high rates of suspensions can have a negative impact on the test scores of students who have not been suspended, and that schools may be better served by only suspending students in moderation. Evidence shows that high incarceration rates can have a devastating impact on offenders, as well as on surrounding families and communities. The researchers set out to see if a similar tactic would yield the same results in schools -\u2013 if high rates of suspension could negatively impact other students' academic achievement. To glean their results, researchers followed about 16,000 middle school and high school students in a Kentucky district over the course of six semesters. They tracked the students\u2019 scores on a statewide test administered three times a year, and compared it to their schools\u2019 suspension rates during the time of test taking.

Zamata comes to \"SNL\" from the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, the comedy collective co-founded by \"SNL\" alum Amy Poehler that has served as a training ground for many young comedy stars. \"SNL\" currently has no black women in the cast, a fact that received criticism from the press as well as within its own cast. After Kenan Thompson vowed to no longer portray black women in drag, many questioned whether the show would indeed add a black woman in order to portray celebrities such as Beyonce and First Lady Michelle Obama. (Only four black women have been in the \"SNL\" cast after nearly 40 years.) In a break with the tight-lipped secrecy typical for \"SNL\" casting decisions, word broke that the show's producers were indeed auditioning black women for a mid-season addition. They also addressed the situation in the opening of an episode hosted by Kerry Washington this season, in which Washington was expected to portray several black female celebrities since nobody in the cast could do so. Like many of the new cast members, Zamata has been tirelessly writing and acting in live and online comedy that has been written up in a variety of sources.

Critics and social media have predecessor. Critics and social media have savaged NBC \u2019s early coverage of the Rio Olympics \u2014 and the early ratings verdict from Nielsen has not been any kinder. Viewership for the first three nights of the Peacock\u2019s prime-time broadcasts is down sharply compared to both the 2012 London and 2008 Beijing games, with younger audiences bailing in particularly big numbers. It\u2019s not all bad news: Tens of millions of Americans are still watching the Olympics, some viewing has likely shifted to online platforms not immediately measured by Nielsen, and Sunday\u2019s swimming-centric schedule resulted in a big ratings surge. But if the early pattern holds, Rio will be the first summer Olympics since Sydney 2000 to score lower Nielsen numbers than itspredecessor. The first sign of trouble for NBC \u2019s Rio ratings came Saturday morning, when data for Friday\u2019s never-ending opening ceremony came in. Per Nielsen, the minimalist curtain-raiser notched a 13.9 household rating (i.e., the percentage of homes with TV sets tuned to the Olympics). While that\u2019s more than two times the audience for the typical episode of the summer\u2019s No. 1 series, NBC \u2019s America\u2019s Got Talent , it represents an eye-popping 35 percent drop", "Passengers Were Shocked When The Pilot Shouted \"OMG\" On The Intercom. His Reason Is Priceless. While mid air on a plane the one thing flight captains should never do is scare their passengers unnecessarily. Everyone know there are protocols they have to follow to avoid that sort of thing, but imagine if something like this happened to you mid-flight. They were on a flight from JFK to London on British Airways when the flight had reached its cruising altitude, the captain came on and announced: \"Ladies and Gentleman, this is your Captain welcome to flight 295 non-stop from New York JFK to London the weather ahead is good, so we should have a smooth uneventful flight, so sit back, relax and... OH, MY GOD! A scream through out the cabin then silence followed.... A few moments later the captain came back on the intercom. \"Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019m sorry if I scared you, while I was talking to you, a flight attendant accidentally spilled a cup of hot coffee in my lap.

Relationship experts do, however, believe adulterers posses some very subtle personality traits - and once you know how to spot them, you can save yourself time and heartbreak. Speaking to FEMAIL, Olga Levancuka, author of How To Be Selfish, said: 'Even though spotting the person who is more likely to cheat can be tricky, there are certain subtle traits that that set cheaters apart from loyal partners. 'The sooner you can identify these traits, the sooner you can take steps to move on and protect yourself from getting hurt.' Here, she and fellow expert Gary Amers share the signs to look out for. 1. They're self-absorbed: Most cheaters tend to be narcissists or at least share many similar qualities. If your other half is self-absorbed and lacks empathy, then he or she is more likely to cheat as the attention and admiration they will get from a new love interest will be more important than your feelings and needs. 2. They're insecure: Insecurity is also a common trait of cheaters. Unfortunately their need to feel loved and have their other half\u2019s constant attention can be what leads them to cheat.

At this moment, polls show a strong upswing for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. He\u2019s made real ground on Hillary Clinton, closing the gap between them by consolidating the Republican Party behind his candidacy. Clinton, meanwhile, is fighting a contentious primary, which keeps her from doing the same. There\u2019s still a strong case to make that Donald Trump is a long shot for the White House\u2014that he\u2019s too unpopular with too many Americans outside the Republican Party and that if the Obama coalition holds, he loses. Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent. At least, that\u2019s what I think. But humility is a virtue, and life is volatile, even if elections often aren\u2019t. That Trump is a poor bet for November doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t win. He could. Which raises an obvious question: How would it happen? And finding an answer here isn\u2019t too difficult. You just need to reverse-engineer the conditions of a Trump loss. What are those conditions? At the top of the list is demographics. Trump is deeply unpopular with black and Latino voters, as well as with women and young people. But Clinton is also unpopular, albeit by a smaller magnitude. Given two unpopular candidates, it\u2019s possible", "Big news for Shakira.

Finding a Dark Moon Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake\u2019s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake\u2019s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake\u2019s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The \"dark moon hypothesis\" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. \"Imagine that the dark material isn\u2019t on Makemake\u2019s surface... it\u2019s in orbit!\" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. \"If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!\" Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake\u2019s moon, the reality", "Shocking number of mail carriers attacked by dogs.

VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis says he has no intention of quitting the papacy -- a possibility opened up by his predecessor Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI. The pope, responding to a question from a young person at a Vatican event, said on Sunday \"I never thought of quitting being pope, or of leaving because of the many responsibilities.\" The pope has previously said he envisioned a short papacy before going on \"to the Father's house,\" but he has never specifically ruled out following in Benedict's footsteps. Benedict retired in 2013, the first pope to step down in 600 years. The pope spoke at a Vatican gathering for the Scholas Occurentes global educational initiative that he launched. George Clooney, accompanied by his wife Amal, and Richard Gere were honored for their contributions. The question of the number of popes who have retired is a bit of a trick question, in that the answer is based on a murky historical record. The short answer is, scholars are certain that at least four popes stepped down while still alive, but as many as eight may have. Benedict IX sold the papacy to his godfather and retired around 1044. Gregory VI, Benedict IX's godfather, was", "The Surprising Thing You Never Have To Do In Watch Dogs 2. The Surprising Thing You Never Have To Do In Watch Dogs 2 By Dirk Libbey There's a lot to do inside the San Francisco of Watch Dogs 2. However, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you have to. The development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. This has apparently worked out so well that there's one major mechanic in the game you don't ever need to touch. I had a chance to sit down with both Watch Dogs 2 as well as the game's creative director where I learned that it's possible to beat Watch Dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. Something interesting is our LV Director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...He used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. This is kind of our goal. You don't have to kill people and you don't have to shoot. Can we achieve that?

Immediately after getting his food tray, a seemingly angry cafeteria lady rushed towards him, took his tray and threw it in the bin. What was the reason for throwing away perfectly good food? Apparently, Dominic had $5 of unpaid cafeteria debt for previous school lunches. He was left humiliated and all of his school friends saw it. \"It was really embarrassing,\" he told CNN. \"Right in front of the whole lunch room, they took my plate away and said I didn\u2019t have enough to eat today.\" When his mother, Amanda Keown, heard that her son\u2019s lunch had been taken away from him because he owed the school less than $5, she was flabbergasted.

This has many gamers thinking as to why there hasn\u2019t been any DLC content released for the game although it was such a massive commercial and critical success. We finally might have an answer to this question thanks to the recently concluded earnings conference call by Take-Two Interactive for Q3 2015. According to Take-Two their net revenue for Q3 was $486.8 million as compared to $954 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. The dip in earnings is mostly due to no notable releases from its stables during this time period while last year had quite a few of them. However, that\u2019s still a large amount of money and most of it is due to one title: Grand Theft Auto V. You might be wondering how that\u2019s possible but it\u2019s obvious. This is due to Grand Theft Auto Online which is the standalone online component of the game. The online product seems to be raking in serious moolah for Take-Two and it\u2019s no surprise that there\u2019s been no single-player DLC pack release for GTA V.

According to the survey, men and women aren't in sync in the bedroom when it comes to the optimum \"Sex O'Clock,\" the Telegraph reports. Men feel most frisky between 6am and 9am, while women are feeling the love way into the night\u2014they most want to romp between 11pm and 2am.

Comic book fans, even those who panned the theatrical release of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice have been pining for the release of the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition. Now that it\u2019s available to own on Blu-Ray and on Amazon Video, things have changed. As almost any critic will tell you, the version of the film shown in theaters was deeply flawed for a number of reasons. Chief among those reasons, though, was the fact that the entire film felt rushed and like there were necessary plot points that were essentially glazed over or skipped entirely. With the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition having 30 more minutes of footage and even a shiny R-rating, some of those major issues with the theatrical version have been fixed. Suffice it to say that the the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition is the far superior version of Zack Snyder\u2019s film. However, one thing that readers have noticed is that the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition isn\u2019t yet available to rent on Amazon Video. This obviously begs the simple question of when this better version of the movie will in fact be available to rent.

In a Mother Earth News piece, The Pesticide Action Network sums up the concerns that many consumers and activists have about the company: \"More and more farmers have been convinced or coerced into using Monsanto's copyrighted seed technology. And Monsanto continues its relentless marketing campaign, spouting promises of genetically-engineered progress: bigger yields, lowered pesticide use, and an end to world hunger. Nevermind that none of these promises have come true since GE crops were first commercialized over 16 years ago.\" \u2014 that is, non-GMO crops. But as Monsanto CTO Robb Fraley explained to Tech Insider, GE technology is just part (albeit a huge part) of the company's portfolio.

Placed founder and CEO David Shim explained that while you don\u2019t need household supplies every day, \"three times a day or more you need to eat, so there\u2019s a higher propensity to visit these types of businesses.\" The lower price per transaction at fast-food chains compared to other retailers also helps them to attract consumers, Shim noted. Consumers also regularly shop at the country\u2019s biggest drugstore chains and big-box retailers. In addition to selling widely purchased goods, these retailers have the most locations in the country. Walgreens, 7-Eleven and CVS Caremark all had more than 7,000 U.S. locations in 2012, among the most stores nationwide. Food chains were even more numerous.

Adapting to college life is even more challenging when faced with the threat of the so-called \"Freshman 15,\" a term for the weight college freshmen supposedly gain during their first year away from home. Is the Freshman 15 real, or just a cultural myth? Let's begin with a bit of a bombshell: The Freshman 15 isn't a legitimate, scientific phrase. Seventeen Magazine introduced the term on its August 1989 cover with the all-caps subhead \"FIGHTING THE FRESHMAN 15.\" Since then, the expression has gained popularity and credence throughout pop culture... but is it a real phenomenon? Recent studies suggest that while college students (both male and female) do gain weight during their first year at school, it's more to the tune of five pounds rather than fifteen. A recent Ohio State University study that included data from 7,418 young people over the course of their college years found that women and men, on average, gained around three pounds during freshman year. Less than ten percent of the freshmen gained 15 pounds (or more),", "This popular soda could cure your hangovers scientists say:. To alleviate the suffering, chugging coffee, downing Advil or simply choosing to forego the wretched day altogether by returning to bed sometimes does the trick. But what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away -- and better still, what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket? A group of Chinese researchers say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure -- and it goes by the name of \"Sprite.\" After examining 57 beverages in a lab, researcher Hua-Bin Li and his colleagues at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou determined that Sprite was one of the drinks that best relieved hangover symptoms. The team of scientists had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body. Specifically, they theorized that certain drinks could impact the body's metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptoms. Chemistry World explains it this way: Some of the adverse effects of alcohol are thought to be caused, not by the ethanol itself, but by ethanol\u2019s first metabolite, acetaldehyde. Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)", "Curiously omitted from all the coverage boosting this guy's conspiracy theories...

MORE: This Is the No. 1 Driver of Diabetes and Obesity The researchers gave the volunteers cherry-flavored drinks that were sweetened with fructose on one day and drinks sweetened with glucose on another day, and asked them to report their hunger levels. Neuroimaging scans of the participants showed more activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and visual cortex of their brains, which are involved in reward processing, when they looked at images of food after they ingested fructose compared to glucose. The researchers also showed the men and women images of high calorie foods and asked if they would like to have food now, or if they would like a monetary bonus later on. When drinking fructose, the individuals were more likely to say they wanted the food reward right away rather than money later on. \"These findings suggest that ingestion of fructose relative to glucose results in greater activation of brain regions involved in attention and reward processing", "Penelope Cruz talks sharing a bed with beautiful actress best friend.

Saudi Arabia stockpiled $116.8 billion of U.S. Treasuries as of March, the Treasury Department announced on Monday, ending four decades of keeping the figure secret. That makes Saudi Arabia the 13th largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, though well behind the $1 trillion-plus owned by China and Japan each. The Saudi figure was first reported by Bloomberg News based on a Freedom of Information Act request. Unlike with most other major owners of U.S. debt, the Treasury Department kept Saudi Arabia's precise holdings secret since the 1970s. Saudi's holdings were lumped together with that of other oil exporting nations, including Venezuela and Iraq. But that policy ended on Monday as the Treasury Department disclosed precise holdings by specific countries that were previously grouped together. A Treasury official told CNNMoney the move was made following a review aimed at trying to provide more \"comprehensive and transparent\" data.

And most recently he\u2019s found out that Trump\u2019s charitable foundation made an illegal campaign contribution to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (this reporting is based, in turn, in part on work done by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington). Then when they found out they had broken the law, they kinda sorta corrected the error but didn\u2019t actually follow their legal obligation to get the money back. It\u2019s all at least a little suspicious. The story includes the phrase: \"Trump staffers said that a series of unusual \u2014 and unrelated \u2014 errors by people working for Trump had led to both the improper donation and to the omission of that donation from the foundation's tax filings.\" What\u2019s more, the contribution to Bondi came right when she was one of several attorneys general who were looking into possible Trump University fraud investigations. Shortly after receiving the illegal campaign contribution she dropped the investigation. Oh, also, it turns out that the Trump Foundation itself was part of a setup to ensure that Trump\u2019s own money was never used to finance a Trump charitable contribution. In the grand scheme of the 2016 campaign this seems like maybe not that big of a deal.", "Fallout 4\u2019s most powerful weapon has been discovered and it\u2019s not what you expected. Ever wonder what the most powerful Fallout 4 item is? One that can be used as an effective weapon, along with being virtually indestructible? Well, search no longer! Speaking of searching, here\u2019s all the Fallout news of last week, in case you missed any! Now, as it turns out, the.. trash can.. is the most powerful item in Fallout 4. Yep. The one thing everyone overlooked. Who could have expected that? You\u2019d think something like the Fat Man, Gauss Rifle, or Mini-Gun would take the cake, but nope. Trash can. And we have proof! As seen below, the trash can will completely block all damage. Toss a grenade under one and you\u2019ll be totally safe. That\u2019s very important considering the next part of this involves using the trash can as.. well.. a mine cannon! Yeah, yeah, it sounds ridiculous, but not much is cooler than killing ghouls, mutants, deathclaws, or whatever really, only using some mines and a trash can, and a player has actually posted a video showing him carrying out this insane feat. You can watch the video below. It\u2019s rather incredible really, considering he\u2019s charging a Behemoth at one point with a trash can..

Sexual abuse causes serious emotional and physical harm, and can ruin a child\u2019s capacity to have healthy relationships as an adult. However, we mustn\u2019t confuse all sexual abuse of children with paedophilia. Paedophiles are sexually attracted to children but they may, or may not, act on their urges. In fact, my experience indicates that most of the people who abuse children are not paedophiles. Research by Alanko and colleagues, looking at the question of whether paedophilia was inherited, showed that approximately 5% of men in the study with paedophilia had offended against children. In fact, people who offend against children, in my experience, are (mostly) men who are obsessed with sex and are looking for a sexual outlet, regardless of the age of the victim. In our research which looked at whether medication was helpful for sexual offenders who struggled with their obsession with sex, we found that while over 90% of them had committed offences against children, most of them had also abused adults. And, in some cases, victims included both males and females, showing a broad pattern of offending. These", "3 Cities That Are Reportedly Being Considered For GTA 6. With the existence of GTA 6 promoting more mystery and rumours than any other game out there at the moment, there is one thing that remains at the core of gamers and fans minds when thinking about a new installment. Where will it be set? Even though GTA 5 is still doing well online. It\u2019s forward that Rockstar will be looking. There\u2019s been a few inklings so far. To name one, could Tokyo by the next blueprint for Rockstar\u2019s series? Maybe. Here\u2019s a few cities that may be the next location for the epic that GTA 6 will surely be. There\u2019s also been a lot of rumours that Rockstar has abandoned development work on GTA 6 to focus more on Grand Theft Auto online but it\u2019s a given that the game will eventually come out. However, that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any talk about where the next GTA game might take place. We look at three possible locations where the game might be going in its sixth installment.

CNN and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, which is co-hosting the Sept. 16 debates, said invitations have been sent by former first lady Nancy Reagan to 16 candidates who meet their criteria. All but Gilmore \"have qualified thus far and have received invitations,\" they said in a statement. Earlier this year CNN said candidates must meet certain criteria, including an average of 1 percent of support in three recent national polls. CNN's latest poll released showed Gilmore at the bottom of the pack with less than one percent. \"Additional candidates will receive invitations if they meet all of the previously released debate criteria.\" CNN and the library said. Like last week's Republican presidential debates hosted by Fox News, the CNN event will actually be two debates - dividing the crowded Republican field into two groups, with one featuring the top 10 candidates. Although nearly all of the candidates made the cut for the CNN event, it is still unclear how the field will look a month from now when CNN and the library determine how to split the group based on their standing as of Sept. 10.

Using that data, we\u2019ve put together some spring break vacations for every group and every budget. But first, there are a few tips to ensure you get the best airfare. First, it\u2019s a good idea to set a price drop alert on your favorite booking website. This will allow you to take advantage of the lower airfare as soon as it becomes available. It\u2019s also helpful to book trips that start on a Tuesday, which is the cheapest day to depart. In comparison, Friday is the most expensive day to depart and will cost you 16% more. Located on the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana is a Caribbean paradise with miles of beach and tons of sun. According to Hopper, the average round-trip ticket to the island will cost $479, but prices are expected to drop, and you could save up to 42% if you set a fare alert.

Forget bunkers in the forest full of food tins and bottled water - it seems New Zealand, with a population of 4.4 million, has become the best option for a new breed of American survivalist. When the New Zealand Herald revealed this week that Silicon Valley tech billionaire Peter Thiel had become a citizen and purchased a lake-front estate it perhaps shouldn't have been a surprise. Mr Thiel, who previously said New Zealand was a \"utopia\" and has invested heavily there, is just one of several US migrants who have realised what the country has to offer. Punching above its weight New Zealand recently overtook Singapore as the best place to do business, according to the World Bank.

The swaggy lil pop star and his cavalry of minders would have us believe that Justin Bieber has a huge dick. Last week, Calvin Klein released photos of Bieber modeling their underwear for a new ad campaign. One memorable shot showed off the singer's protruding package in arresting profile. Shortly after the photos hit the Internet, a web site called Breathe Heavy posted what it claimed was the same image prior to re-touching. If that claim were accurate, it would mean that Calvin Klein (well, not him personally, although maybe) had stuffed Bieber's stocking nearly to bursting. Here are the two images side-by-side: Bieber's team immediately insisted that Breathe Heavy's photo was fake, and requested the web site take it down. Breathe Heavy complied, originally replacing the photos with an editor's note, but eventually removing the entire post altogether. In that since-deleted note, Breathe Heavy's editor seems to accept Bieber's explanation at gunpoint. Bieber denies the photo is real, and I respect that and will believe him. The question, therefore, is: Are the claims of the Bieber camp correct, and the photo fake? Or did Breathe Heavy have the real photo, and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation?

HOW TRUMP WENT FROM HERO OF THE DISAFFECTED TO NOMINEE - Benjy Sarlin: \"Today, a description of who supports Trump is simple enough: Republicans. In the final seven races before party leaders crowned Trump the presumptive nominee, he took every county save for six, while winning almost every demographic slice of GOP voters....[T]here are a lot of voters... who warmed to Trump gradually. In a March 2015 NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, 74 percent of Republican voters said they could not imagine supporting Trump. The number was only marginally better, at 66 percent, when he launched his campaign that June. By April of 2016, however, the number had plummeted to 38 percent. By the time the primary race ended, Trump also drew close to 50 percent support from GOP primary voters in national polls. It wasn\u2019t always that way: For almost all of 2015, he polled in the mid-20s, leading many Republicans to speculate that there was a ceiling to his support....The story of Trump, then, is about a committed minority of Republican voters, whose existence was routinely ignored, gradually taking over the entire party.

Harley's partnership with Ford for a limited-edition F-150 pickup truck was a smart blending of two American-made brands that complemented each other's strengths, even though it only ever made up 1% to 2% of Ford's F-150 sales. Harley's cake decorating kits, on the other hand, not so much. And it's not clear that a corporate blending of drinking and motorcycle riding leans more toward the pickup truck marketing venture than to being a Martha Stewart wannabe. Certainly, Harley-Davidson needs to do something to boost revenues. Its full year earning released a couple of weeks ago showed the big bike maker's sales were still in decline in the U.S., its biggest market, and profits were getting slashed. Revenues were down 2% in the fourth quarter and more than 4.5% across all of 2015, though part of that was due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. Yet it can't be denied lower sales here at home are hurting. U.S. motorcycle sales were down 4% for the quarter and almost 6% for the year. Finding other sources of revenue to supplement slumping bike sales will at least soften the blow. One smart way Harley is doing it is through clothing sales, specifically", "Lenny Kravitz spotted kissing a first lady. Kravitz joined French \"first girlfriend\" Valerie Trierweiler yesterday at Saint Laurent's Spring 2014 runway presentation at the Grand Palais, where a hawk-eyed Women's Wear Daily reporter caught the pair kissing one another on the cheek.

Of course, Trierweiler, a relative outsider to the fashion world, has become quite chummy with her seasonal seat mate Anna Wintour. The two were seated next to each other for the third consecutive Saint Laurent show, so we're sure they had plenty to catch up on.

You\u2019d think the most sleep-deprived state in the nation would be somewhere in the sleepless northeast, right? But you\u2019d be wrong. A new study has found that the state with the worst sleep habits in the country is Hawaii. So while Hawaii may make a popular vacation destination for those looking for relax, the people who live there are depriving themselves of sleep, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. The study examined how many Americans were getting less than the recommended 7 hours of sleep per night, and found alarmingly that a third of Americans aren\u2019t getting that amount of rest, based on a poll of 400,000 adults in all 50 states. Hawaii scored the worst at 56.1 percent. The best? South Dakota at 71.6 percent. Geographically, the Great Plains states tended to score the best, as well as states along the Appalachian Mountains. However, southern states also performed poorly along with Hawaii, such as Alabama and Georgia. And don\u2019t think that the people who work hard every day are the ones deprived of sleep. It\u2019s actually people who are unable to work or who are unemployed who get the least amount of sleep. Married people not", "Why this county refused to lower flags after Orlando. Flags across the United States no longer are flying at half-staff in honor of the victims of the Orlando gay nightclub massacre \u2014 but residents of one Alabama county won't notice a difference.

Hint: It's Got Nothing To Do With Blood. While some people resort to the common answers to the cry \u2018why do they always bite me?\u2019 your biting potential doesn't boil down to any of the reason you've probably heard. While most people point to your blood type, or your perfume, or a red meat-heavy diet, the real reason you might be a target has nothing to do with any of that. Turns out it\u2019s actually because of the types of bacteria that exist on your skin. According to scientists, some bacteria secrete chemicals that have better smells than others. This means that mosquitoes are more likely to want to chow down on people with more attractive smells. And it\u2019s not just our bacterial friends who send out smelly signals, mosquitoes are attracted to the carbon dioxide in our breath, and they tend to love people who are exercising.

Most of the time, John Angerstein is the one saving lives. As a fire chief, he is rushing into burning buildings and cars regularly and wants to make sure that everybody is okay. This time around, John turned out needing some help and it was his barber who was able to come and save the day. John went and sat down for a haircut one day just as usual, but when his barber was trimming along the side of his right ear, his barber noticed that there was some type of mole on his scalp right above his ear area. He pointed it out, but John said that he also had other moles so he ignored the warning and then proceeded to go home. Later on, another person pointed out the darkened area above his ear, and that was the last straw for him.

The nascent carmaker unveiled its Air prototype in December and had said it would start production of its all-electric luxury sedan in 2018. That timeline has slipped a bit -- Lucid wants to secure Series D financing before breaking ground on a plant in Arizona, then debut the car in 2019, according to chief technology officer Peter Rawlinson. \"We don\u2019t have the money in place. That\u2019s why we need to secure Series D in order to execute this,\" Rawlinson, who led engineering of Tesla\u2019s Model S sedan, said Thursday at the New York International Auto Show. \"It would be irresponsible to start moving earth or start anything until we have a financial runway to execute that professionally and with absolute integrity.\" Once funding is in place, it will take 24 months before Lucid begins production, Rawlinson said. In November, the company said it would break ground and begin hiring in the first half of 2017, with production beginning in 2018. The extended timeline means Lucid will fall another year behind Tesla and other competitors in the race to bring the next generation of low-emissions vehicles to market.

In fact, he was the first individual to take to the air via a hydrogen-filled balloon in 1783, though there's no clear answer as to how high he rose and how long he was in the air. This is certainly a memorable feat, but what the Frenchman is perhaps best known for is his work that later became Charles' law. Jacques Charles was a French scientist and inventor whose most notable work came during the late 18th century. Charles was presumably the first to discover that hydrogen could be used as a lifting agent in balloons, according to the ChemTeam Charles' law, or the law of volumes, simply states that a gas tends to expand when heat is applied to it. This law was published in 1802 by French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who credited Charles for all his work on the subject, the ChemTeam reports. So, because Ivory soap is full of air molecules, it begins to expand when placed in the microwave.

That's the conclusion of a group of researchers studying men and women who lived in the caves of Mount Carmel -- not far from what is now Haifa, Israel -- between 15,000 and 11,600 years ago. Known as the Natufian civilization, this culture has been the subject of an extensive study by an international group of archaeologists, who have discovered dozens of skeletons in the area. One of the most recent studies of the cave dwellers, slated to be published in the December 2013 version of the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, includes evidence that Natufian men engaged in large communal meals next to grave sights, reports Israeli news outlet Haaretz. Led by Haifa University's Professor Dani Nadel, with the help of colleagues Dr. Reuven Yeshurun and Professor Guy Bar-Oz, the archaeologists searched a location known as the Raqefet Cave and uncovered thousands of small animal bones they believe are evidence of feasts not unlike modern wakes. The Natufian people during the time period studied were undergoing an important transition from being hunter-gatherers to living communally. These wakes potentially represent the fascinating, fledgling attempt at unity by a previously nomadic culture, Yeshurun told The Huffington Post in an email. \"From the beginning", "Why You Shouldn\u2019t Drink Water Immediately. There has been a lot of debate on the time and amount of water you should be having before, with and after meals. A lot of people have the habit of downing umpteen glasses of water along with their meals, perhaps with the intention of washing down the food and hoping that this aids the digestive process. However, nutritionists across the world dismiss the idea strongly. Various studies show that the practice severely hampers digestion by diluting the essential gastric juices and causes an upsurge in insulin levels. The issue here is three-fold: consuming water before meals, consuming water alongside meals, and consuming water after meals. Renowned nutritionist Dr. Anju Sood says, \"It roughly takes two hours to digest what you eat. The food goes through your esophagus to the stomach, then to your colon before being flushed out of your system. There is a certain fluid-solid proportion in our gastric system. If you consume water before the meals, you are not only disturbing the fluid component by diluting what you eat, you are also fastening the digestion process as the food now enters the large intestine much sooner than it should. Hence it is not advisable to have water just", "Why You Should Pee As You Shower, According To Mathematics. Let\u2019s think about it for a moment, mathematically. Every single time you pee, you have to flush the toilet. Whereas those foul smelly poops do need considerable amounts of water to send them off to the mysterious aquatic underworld below, urine barely needs any encouragement once the flushing begins. Although many toilet flushes can be stopped part of the way through their noisy waterfalls, most can\u2019t, and that\u2019s wasting a heck of a lot of water. An average flush for a modern, Western-style toilet uses 6 liters (1.6 gallons) of water, and the average adult pees about seven times every 24 hours. That means that each day of weeing takes 42 liters (11.1 gallons) of toilet water to flush away. Assuming that people urinate the same way every single day, this means in just one year, the average person uses 15,330 liters (4,050 gallons) of toilet water. There are 319 million people in the US, so assuming they all pee the same \u2013 which they don\u2019t, but we\u2019re making broadly accurate assumptions here \u2013 that\u2019s about 4.9 trillion liters (1.3 trillion gallons) of water flushed away in the name of urine every 365 days.

NEW YORK, Sept 23 - Exercise trends come and go as step aerobics yield to interval training, weight machines are tossed for medicine balls and Pilates falls in and out of fashion. But when it comes to exercise habits, Americans say they prefer to stick to what's simple, solo and short. Nearly 75 percent of 1,200 adults, aged 24 to 44, questioned in an online survey about exercise habits said they worked out at least once a week and 77 percent prefer to do it alone.

Thompson said the survey probably provides a \"useful snapshot\" into the behaviors of the responding age group. \"Outside that group,\" he said, \"it's a little dangerous.\" Sixty one percent of people questioned in the poll during the last two weeks of August said they don't exercise in a gym, and the average American is no early bird.

The 37-year old boxer unretired for another fight. Manny Pacquiao announced his retirement, which lasted for 3 months, after his unanimous win against Timothy Bradley. Pacquiao did not deny his eagerness to come back to his career of 21 years which made him a household name and a worldwide recognized boxer when he rose in eight divisions. After the game which gave Mahindra a 105-103 win against the defending champion of the Governors\u2019 Cup, the San", "What this 136-year-old book can teach you about life. The author's wisdom is apparent in much of his nonfiction, particularly his short, piercing essay, \"What is Art?\" His fiction is full of life lessons too, both intended by the author or gleaned by modern readers. Here are seven life lessons from one of Tolstoy's classics, \"Anna Karenina\": 1. All that glitters is not gold. When confronted with a choice between two suitors, Levin and Vronsky, 18-year-old Kitty believed that she prefered the latter, who is more objectively handsome and charming. Although he overtly flirted with Kitty, Vronsky quickly falls for Anna, but in the end, he leaves them both heartbroken. Levin, on the other hand, appears eccentric to the general public, but proves to be a reliable partner. 2. Divorce should be a socially acceptable option. Divorce rate statistics are often discussed as if they're a death knell for romantic happiness, and indeed, many young people have adopted the \"why even bother?\" mentality. Of course, divorce can have negative short-term consequences on children, but recent studies have shown that most adjust well in the long run. We believe Tolstoy (or at least a few of his characters) would have been thankful for the option. Imagine if Anna and Karenin could", "Here's what happens to pro-athletes after they retire...

A renowned gynecologist and infertility and in vitro fertilisation specialist, Dr. Sonia Malik, at one of the leading fertility treatment centres in New Delhi, stated that 46% of Indians, between the ages of 31 and 40 years, need medical intervention to conceive. This is because one or both partners in the relationship are suffering from fertility problems. Another city gynaecologist named, Dr. Yashica Gudesar, said one of the main reasons causing infertility is polycystic ovarian disorder in women and reduced sperm count in men. Studies also suggest that it is wrong to blame the women all the time for being infertile. Statistically, in nearly 30% of all infertility cases, men have been found to be infertile, as per Society for the Study of Male Reproduction. Some of the reasons that doctors have stated for this problem is irregular working hours and work stress in the IT, media industry and BPOs. Apparently, constant use of Android or iPhone affects sperm count as they have higher emission rate. Environmental pollution also to some extent contributes to low sperm count. The food you eat and your sleeping patterns have also found to affect the quality of sperms and eggs these days. Moreover, men who", "Do You Own One Of These VHS Tapes?

It's been three years since McMillan's blog went viral, and now she's back to sit down with Oprah for another brutally honest conversation about the spiritual path of relationships, love and, of course, sex. In her upcoming interview on \"Super Soul Sunday,\" McMillan addresses the issue of casual sex, which she writes about in her book, Why You're Not Married... Yet. \"You say, 'Past a certain age, casual sex is like recreational heroin. It doesn't stay recreational for long,'\" Oprah reads from McMillan's book. \"What a powerful, savvy line.\" McMillan acknowledges that casual sex may work for some people, but strongly advises taking a close look at yourself to determine whether you're one of them. \"You can't take your three girlfriends who are successful having casual sex and be one of them if that's not you,\" she says. \"You just need to figure out who you are.\" On a personal level, McMillan says she knows that she is not one of those women. \"I cannot have casual sex and keep it casual.

The craters pepper the surface of Arabia Terra, a geologically ancient region of northern Mars. They appear as several huge circular pits that resemble Earth's calderas, in which magma beneath a volcano drains after a volcanic eruption, causing the ground above the magma chamber to collapse. The best example on Mars is a feature called Eden patera, a depression about 85 kilometers long, 55 kilometers wide and 1.8 kilometers deep, says Joseph Michalski, a researcher jointly at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and at the Natural History Museum in London. Using data from several satellites orbiting Mars, Michalski and his colleague Jacob Bleacher, a volcanologist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, mapped Eden patera in detail. Eden patera is the best example of suspected supervolcanoes on Mars. Its caldera is shown here as a gray bullseye. In a report in Nature today, they describe three separate calderas within the depression, along with possible signs of a lake of solidified lava and a volcanic vent where lava could have oozed out. \"I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s an impact crater,\" Michalski says. Another possible explanation is that underground ice could have melted and formed the depression, but ice", "You Won\u2019t Believe What Emma Roberts Has Done Now.

Levi's CEO Chip Bergh says we should stop washing our jeans because it's good for the environment since it saves water and energy. \"If you talk to real denim aficionados, they tell you don't wash your blue jeans,\" Bergh said in a 2014 interview at Fortune magazine's Brainstorm Green conference. This advice may seem cringeworthy. But apart from smelling, microbiologists say there is nothing to worry about from a health perspective if you never wash your jeans. Is not washing your jeans safe? There is no evidence that not washing jeans is hazardous to your health, according to Bernhard Redl, an associate professor in the molecular biology department at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. This generally holds true when your denim is worn under normal conditions, such as everyday street wear.

The government has long been the subject of public criticism for not solving the issue which is killing the productivity of workers. Recently, the government has issued a ban on provincial buses in EDSA. The proposal received various reactions from the public. Albay Representative Joey Salceda. Photo from alchetron.com Some said that while provincial buses cause traffic, the proposed action will not solve the entirety of the issue. According to some, the ban is anti-poor. This is because the main mode of transportation of those who cannot travel using their own cars is through provincial buses. There are also those who work in the Metro and travel through provincial buses day and night. In an interview recently, Albay Rep.

Cheap, easy to prepare and undeniably delicious, instant noodles have become a favorite food in many countries around the world despite its reputation for being unhealthy. Also called instant ramen, the pre-cooked dried noodles packed with flavoring powder and seasoning oil, has often been criticized as a meal devoid of nutrients. Despite the meal being notoriously known to be high in carbohydrates and fat but very low in protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals, it has somehow retained its global popularity, According to the World Instant Noodles Association (WINA), 52 countries consumed 97.7 billion servings last year alone. Among its highest consumers are China and Hong Kong, which together consumed 40.43 billion servings, followed by Indonesia, with 13.20 billion servings consumed. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. is not too far behind with 4 billion instant noodles consumed in 2015. But its reputation for being a \"junk food,\" actually gets worse. A Baylor University and Harvard study published in the Journal of Nutrition revealed that eating instant noodles may increase risks of heart disease and stroke, according to Washington Post.

I know others might disagree with me, but I will take a good quality olive oil over butter any day! I love using it to make popcorn. I drizzle it on fresh tomatoes and slices of bread. I use it to fry fish and as an ingredient in cakes. Before there were rules for the amount of liquid you could carrying on a plane, my mother and I would bring half-gallon containers of olive oil back from our trips to Greece. The best olive oils come from Greece. I say this with objectivity as a chef, and would like to think that this overrides any bias that my Greek heritage holds. In Greece it is said that the best of Greek olive oils come from the Peloponnese. For years I have wished that Greeks would be more like the Italians. The Italians do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their products to other countries. With the booming introduction of Greek yogurt into the U.S., I'm hoping that Greek olive oil will soon follow suit. George Papageorgiou is trying to make that happen.

So how do you catch Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Go? Here's what we know. Based on the information, the four will not appear in the wild. All of their data is missing a \"Base Capture Rate\", which indicates that they can't be caught in the wild. That's a pretty good indicator that all four Pokemon (plus Mew) are being reserved for special events or prizes of some kind. So if you can't catch Mewtwo and the other Legendary Pokemon in the wild, how do you get them? Well, the popular theory is that they're being saved for \"raids\", a timed event in which players team up to take down a particularly strong Pokemon. We saw a glimpse of that in the first trailer for Pokemon Go, but Niantic has been tight-lipped on the subject since. Some players are also speculating that the Legendaries could be reserved as some sort of reward for holding a gym or being a top ranked player on your team. Of course, Pokemon Go doesn't currently have a ranking system or way to track how long you've held a gym, so those theories seem more like fanciful speculation than hard fact. What we do know is that", "What species would become dominant on earth if humans died out? Assuming that we don\u2019t extinguish all other life as we disappear (an unlikely feat in spite of our unique propensity for driving extinction), history tells us to expect some pretty fundamental changes when humans are no longer the planet\u2019s dominant animal species. So if we were given the chance to peek forward in time at the Earth some 50m years after our disappearance, what would we find? Which animal or group of animals would \"take over\" as the dominant species? Would we have a Planet of the Apes, as imagined in popular fiction? Or would the Earth come to be dominated by dolphins, or rats, or water bears, or cockroaches or pigs, or ants? The question has inspired a lot of popular speculation and many writers have offered lists of candidate species. Before offering any guesses, however, we need to carefully explain what we mean by a dominant species.

This shouldn't come as a surprise, given extensive reports of lax standards and outright fraud in the olive-oil business. In fact, the findings are better than some earlier studies that indicated some olive oils were adulterated with other kinds of oil, such as soybean oil, or were made with olives from countries other than Italy, despite label claims of \"Made in Italy.\" These practices were revealed in a widely shared New York Times interactive feature last year that was based on a couple of different studies. The NCL's testing comes with a load of caveats. It wasn't a \"study\" so much as a more-or-less random bit of testing. Puzzlingly, while the NCL listed the five oils that passed the test, it didn't name the six that didn't. That\u2019s because the companies whose products failed the tests made \"a huge stink\" over the results, said Sally Greenberg, the NCL\u2019s executive director.

With Kanye bringing a Jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour, The Huffington Post decided now is a good time to compare the relative places of Kanye and Jesus in the popular zeitgeist. To do this, we analyzed a year's worth of Twitter data (from Oct. 21, 2012 to Oct. 20, 2013) via the third-party service Topsy. When comparing Jesus and Kanye on Twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison? There are a lot terms Twitter users use to reference Jesus: there's the broad \"Jesus,\" which includes other people named Jesus, the more specific \"Jesus Christ\" and foreign language versions -- Jesucristo in Spanish, gesu\u0300 cristo in Italian. Some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @Jesus.

If you\u2019re reading this article, you are almost certainly a user of the decimal system. That system is also known as base-10 because of its repeating pattern of 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is followed by 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and so forth. But the decimal system is not the only counting system available. The Babylonians used base-60. The Mayas used base-20. Some Australian aboriginal groups may have used base-5. And of course, today most counting and calculation is done by computers not in decimal but binary, the base-2 system of zeros and ones. Each system has subtle advantages depending on what sort of counting and calculations are needed. The decimal system is handy considering that people have 10 fingers. But when it comes to division, other systems are better. Because 10 has only two prime factors (2 and 5), dividing by thirds results in an annoyingly infinite approximation (0.3333 ... ) whereas the base-12 counting system produces a nice finite solution.

Univision's addition of The Onion follows on other investments in digital media including its acquisition of The Root, a news site geared toward African Americans, as well as its considerable stake in Fusion, the television/digital hybrid that it founded with Disney.

However, people were doubtful of her claims when she failed to produce a photo of the two of them for proof. Some even thought that Andrea was simply seeking attention. \"Ang galing ko,\" Andrea joked when she remembered about not having a photo together with Diesel. Eventually, speculations regarding the truth behind her statements were silenced when Ricky Lo managed to confirm the situation with Vin Diesel. Diesel confessed of having met Andrea in LA during an interview with Ricky Lo.

Image: www.techradar.com The new Play Anywhere feature of Xbox One will be live starting September 13. The release date of the feature, which was announced during last month\u2019s E3 conference, was confirmed by Microsoft to Polygon. The Play Anywhere feature will allow players to get a PC version of a game for free if they buy its digital copy on Xbox One, and vice versa. The feature also lets the players save their game and achievements across both devices. However, the upcoming feature will need the Windows 10 Anniversary update which will roll out on August 2. It\u2019s another summer update, which will come out soon, and will also be required for Xbox One users. ReCore will be the first game to support the Play Anywhere feature, which will release on September 13 alongside the feature itself. Some of the other upcoming games which will support these features are Gears of War 4, Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 3, Scalebound, State of Decay 2, and Halo Wars 2.

Famously known as \"The Lion Whisperer,\" Richardson grasps the attention of viewers worldwide for informative Question & Answer sessions. \"The question we get asked a lot on YouTube is: Are lions inherently mean?\" he said. Most surprisingly, Richardson answered the question with a confident \"No.\" Africa\u2019s apex predator, the lion, undoubtedly exhibits a majestic persona but is not to be mistaken for a household pet. Lions are at the top of the food chain and very rarely turn down a fight. While the female\u2019s hunting skills surpass species nationwide, it is the male that holds the vigorous strength and most-feared stealth. \"They are social animals and they actually have the ability to be extremely affectionate,\" said Richardson. \"Having said that, they don\u2019t actually understand their own strength and sometimes, unwittingly, just in play, they could injure you quite badly.\" Richardson inherited the name \"The Lion Whisperer\" years ago after dedicating his entire life to the conservation of big cats. On his YouTube channel, he is seen playing with the lions, riding on the male\u2019s back and snuggling up with the females. Despite his impeccable relationships with the intimidating species, he never overlooks their capabilities. \"You have to really know what you\u2019re", "EA just confirmed two of the most hated features will be part of Battlefield 1. Battlefield 1\u2019s official trailer has been getting rave reviews both from the gaming community and industry experts in general. Not only have the reveal trailer become the most viewed trailer on Youtube, but it also crushed its competitor Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare\u2019s trailer, both in terms of reception and amount of views. However, one should not forget that the Battlefield franchise is being published by EA, who isn\u2019t really a fan-favorite either. And now, the company has sneakily confirmed that both micro-transactions and map packs would be part of Battlefield 1.

Last Thursday, a site called Balanced Rebellion launched a video featuring Abraham Lincoln encouraging Americans to reject both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and to vote for Gary Johnson. The site presents a brilliant idea: it pairs up a Republican who hates both Trump and Clinton with a Democrat who hates both Clinton and Trump, so rather than voting to stop the candidate they fear more, each person will be free to vote third party. \"Look, if America is Gotham City, then Hillary is the mob and Trump is the Joker,\" the video's Lincoln declares. \"The mob is always there, it's corrupt, but at least you know what you're getting. The Joker just got here, he's creating total chaos, and you don't know what he'll do next but you know it's going to be hell.\" \"America, picking between the Joker and the mob is not a real choice.

The proposed law, which was introduced last week by state Sen. Constance Johnson (D-Oklahoma City), would make it legal for adults over age 21 in Oklahoma to buy, possess and consume up to an ounce of cannabis. State residents would also be allowed to grow up to five marijuana plants in a secure area at home, out of public view. The tax-and-regulate bill, which is known as Senate Bill 2116, tasks the state Department of Health with licensing growers, testing facilities and retail marijuana stores where the buds would be sold along with other marijuana products. The bill would also significantly reduce penalties for Oklahoma residents younger than 21 who are caught with under an ounce of weed. The current law allows persons under age 21 to be imprisoned for a year for possessing even a crumb of cannabis. Johnson's law would instead require them to attend a drug awareness class of up to four hours in length. First offenders' criminal records would be kept clean.

For more than 15 years, Savage\u2019s doctors doled out the same advice: You need to stop gaining weight. When Savage replied that she had tried watching her diet and exercising, only to pack on more pounds, it was clear they simply didn\u2019t believe her.

(Photo: GABRIELLE LURIE, AFP/Getty Images) Diehard Apple (AAPL) fans are fretting over what will go missing in the newest iPhone. But investors are more worried about something other than an absent headphone jack: The missing enthusiasm for Apple's stock. Shares of Apple are down 0.7% in the 30 days leading up to the 11th iPhone product launch expected Wednesday, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 index 0.1% increase during the same time. The lackluster stock reaction coming into the smartphone announcement is a departure from previous Apple smartphone launches going back to the original iPhone almost a decade ago. On average, Apple shares have gained 3.8% in the month prior to an announcement. The last iPhone, the shrunken-down and discounted SE, certainly sparked more interest, gaining 10.3% in the 30 days prior to the March 2016 announcement as the S&P 500 rose 6.9%. The lack of excitement is notable given the importance of the product to Apple; iPhone revenue accounted for two-thirds of Apple's revenue last year, according", "You Won't Believe How Fast This Koenigsegg Went At Vmax.

Jonze's film, a near-future tale about a man (Phoenix) who falls in love with his computer operating system (voiced by Johansson), received high praise from many critics following its debut, with most singling out Johansson's voice work as exceptional. \"It's Johansson who pulls off the trickiest feat: She creates a complex, full-bodied character without any body at all. Detached from her lethally curvaceous figure, the actress' breathy contralto is no less seductive, but it also alights with tenderness and wonder as Samantha, both here on Earth and up there in the Cloud, voraciously devours literature, philosophy and human experience,\" wrote Variety critic Scott Foundas. \"Johansson's work in the film is lovely, and the best thing about the way she plays the part is that there's nothing calculated or 'sexy' about the way she approaches it. Removed from the undeniable sweater-girl appeal she packs when she's onscreen, forced to rely only on her voice, Johansson comes across as a warm, curious, vibrant personality. It's incredibly appealing,\" echoed HitFix critic Drew McWeeny. (HuffPost Entertainment was in the tank for Johansson as well.)

Worrying is something we all do now and again, but if your worrying is repetitive, it focuses on hypothetical problems, or it starts to disrupt your life, it could be a sign of something more serious. Another sign of anxiety is specific, irrational fear. This could be a fear of an object, activity or situation, for example. But this symptom might be harder to spot, because people with phobias tend to form avoidance behaviour. This means you, possibly subconsciously, avoid the phobia, therefore reducing the fear and not realising the severity of the problem. Sufferers of anxiety are more likely to experience high-arousal states, when the sympathetic nervous system is activated. This puts the body in fight or flight mode, and subconsciously tenses muscles so they're prepared to see off the perceived threat. The mind and the digestive system are closely linked, and research has found that stress and anxiety can cause digestive problems, such as symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome. There is a close relationship between sleep and anxiety. If you notice your sleeping patterns change, you find it more difficult to sleep or become more tired, this could be a sign of anxiety.

A recent outbreak of polio in the war-torn country only serves to underscore these worsening health woes. The WHO recently confirmed 10 cases of the infectious disease in toddlers in northern Syria.

In the communities where we opened our integrated primary and reproductive health care clinics and our pair of mobile units, we were -- and still are -- essentially the only health providers. There is no health system. Government-supported clinics closed down months earlier, meaning the most at-risk population of mothers, babies and the elderly have nowhere to turn after two years of civil war.

Nearly one in four 18-to-25-year-olds lack health care coverage, according to the poll, released Thursday. That\u2019s the highest rate since late 2011. But it's still lower than the share that lacked health insurance before an Obamacare provision kicked in in March 2010, allowing Americans to stay on their parents' health insurance until they are 26. These uninsured young adults now face a choice between signing up for Obamacare and paying a monthly fee for health care coverage, or risk going without health insurance and pay a fine that in some cases could be less costly than the coverage. The deadline to sign up is March 31, 2014. White House officials believe that this group needs to sign up for Obamacare in order for the program to be successful, according to the Washington Post. Without them, the health care exchanges will instead fill up with the other kinds of people that typically lack coverage -- older or more sickly patients who are often denied insurance because their needs are so expensive. If that happens, premiums for those using the exchanges, a core part of Obamacare, will soar to sky high levels. And if that happens, the law could fail, some experts say.", "Trump Has 80 Million Reasons His Campaign Just Got Stronger. In a presidential election, monthly campaign finance reports that document how much money a candidate takes in are a generally accepted sign of the health of the horses in the race. From that perspective, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is looking much healthier. Figures released Wednesday show that in July, Trump secured $80 million in donations to support his candidacy and the Republican Party. Although that does not quite keep up with the $90 million that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton reported raising in July, it is a major step up from May, a month in which Trump raised $3 million. Trump now lists $37 million in cash on hand, up for $17 million at the start of the month. His two joint fundraising committees have another $37 million in the bank. \"We are extremely proud of our 69% growth in small dollar donations which shows the broad based support of over one million donors across America,\" Trump Finance Committee Chairman Steve Mnuchin said in a statement. \"Our volunteers and contributors are clearly committed to electing Donald J.

Ms. Paltrow was on \"Chelsea Lately\" earlier this week speaking with her good friend Chelsea Handler to promote her new sex addiction romantic comedy, \"Thanks For Sharing,\" but it seems like she shared a little too much when she revealed her plans for her upcoming 41st birthday. What does she plan to do? Binge on food from anti-gay fast food chain, Chick-Fil-A!

Here are five reasons why baseball wouldn't be the same without this random, joyful moment. THE MUSIC Aside from the national anthem at the beginning of most sporting events, no piece of music is so deeply associated with a specific moment in sports. It was written by Jack Norworth, who had a successful career in show business starring on Broadway in the early 1900s before also appearing in several sound films. THE MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS The origins of the seventh inning stretch are lost to the shadows of history. One popular story dates back to the days of President William Howard Taft, who was attending a game in 1910 and stood up during the middle of the seventh inning to stretch his legs. Naturally (the story goes) when all of the other fans in attendance saw Taft stand, they followed suit. Another theory about the tradition's origins cites an 1869 issue of the New York Herald, which documented a game in which the entire crowd simply stood up after a brutally long second inning of play, thus inventing \"the stretch\" (albeit a bit earlier in the game). Other competing accounts are out there, but no conclusive proof. President William Howard Taft throws", "What this driver was caught doing at a car wash will really make you shake your head.

Attorney Michel Togue, who has defended many Cameroon residents who have been accused of homosexuality, tells ThinkProgress that very few of his clients were ever caught engaging in an actual same-sex act, as local police have made arrests based solely on how the individual is presented if an accusation has been made. If a man is employed as a hairdresser, he said, or found to be cross-dressing, those attributes could be used as evidence that the suspect is gay in a court of law. \"To catch people having sex, to catch them in the act, you have to break the law. You have to violate their privacy, which is an offense,\" he told the publication. \"But the police will not focus on the offense of breaking the privacy of someone, but they will focus on the fact that they saw two people of the same gender having sex.\" Meanwhile, Togue explained that the nation's anti-gay laws were impacting HIV/AIDS outreach, as many patients \"can\u2019t go to the hospital for the treatment or even for a test because they\u2019re afraid.\" Last year, Human Rights Watch said that at least 28 people had been charged under Cameroon's anti-gay laws in the past three", "There\u2019s Only One Person Alive Born in the 1800s \u2014 And Her Diet Is Incredible.

It's largely about how it feels in the mouth. Once a piece of cheddar has been heated to around 150\u00b0F, the matrix of milk proteins that provide its structure begins to break down, and the cheese takes on a creamy texture that many people find appealing. What defines creaminess, and why do people find it so appetizing? That's a mystery. But a group of scientists based in the Netherlands, using experimental vanilla custard, found that the dessert's creaminess depends on factors including its viscosity, homogeneity, and texture and surface appearance. One of the scientists, Rene\u0301 de Wijk of Wageningen UR's Food & Biobased Research division, says test subjects were especially inclined toward custards that produce lower friction in the mouth. The same factors may apply to cheese, de Wijk says. Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen, adds that the warmth of melted cheese provides its own source of pleasure.

The Roman officers stayed with them and asked about their long lives together. The couple spoke of their isolation, especially in the summer months, when their neighbors go away. The officers asked if they might look inside the kitchen pantry and then, upon finding some simple ingredients, offered to cook the couple a meal of pasta, butter and cheese. \"Nothing special,\" the police department wrote in Italian on its Facebook page last week. \"But with a precious ingredient: Their humanity.\" Loneliness and anguish is not a crime, and the cops could have seen there was no incident and left. But they instead chose to kept the couple company. The department shared the couple's story along with two photos of the husband and wife, married 70 years, eating their pasta with an officer cleaning up at the sink in the background. The post was written with notably poetic flair. It describes Jole and Michele alone at home with only the TV as company.

Until a visitor to the museum decided to start playing with one of the clocks.

The video is captioned: \"This is why we beg and plead with our visitors to please refrain from touching objects in museums.\" Indeed. In the video, an abstract, wooden sculpture clock appeared not to be working, so a male tourist decided to take matters into his own hands, pulling on weights and levers for more than 30 seconds before the clock came flying off the wall and into pieces on the floor.

If you live in Texas or parts of Plains, you may be familiar with the dryline. It is a boundary that represents a difference between relatively dry and moist air. Moist air (less dense) can be lifted along the dryline to initiate storms. Wait, shouldn't air with moisture in it be more dense? Moist air is actually less dense because for a given volume, water vapor has a molecular weight of about 18 grams per mole (atomic units) whereas dry air (mostly nitrogen and oxygen) has a molecular weight of 28.97 grams per mole. So when you add moisture to a volume, you are lowering the density. Feel free to review Avogadro's Law if you have a headache by now (smile). 2.

The AHA group focused on decreasing their daily calorie intake in order to lose weight, and they were provided with goals to limit saturated fat.

Studying microbes in such extreme and closed-off environments could help scientists understand how life may thrive in the harshest places on Earth and potentially other planets.

Today the lake has a thin covering of just 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 m) of ice, but thousands of years ago, it was entombed under more than 1,600 feet (500 m) of ice.

The Patriots' defense is not as good as the scoring numbers indicate. New England led the NFL in fewest points allowed during the regular season, but that ranking doesn't tell the full story. According to Football Outsiders, the Patriots faced the easiest slate of opposing offenses. They ranked 16th in defensive efficiency -- 23rd against the pass and fourth against the run. Granted, New England has shown steady improvement, but the Patriots now face a Falcons unit that played the second-toughest slate of defenses and still led the league in scoring and efficiency. What makes Atlanta so good? It's not just about stopping one or two guys. The Falcons take advantage of different matchups on a weekly basis. According to Elias, Matt Ryan threw touchdowns to 13 different receivers in the regular season -- the most of any quarterback in NFL history. To label the Falcons' offense vs. the", "Why Charlie Hunnam dropped \"50 Shades of Grey\". Hunnam, a writer himself, reportedly submitted extensive notes about the script. Executives associated with the film received those notes positively, according to THR, and Hunnam eventually requested further script approval but was denied. That led to intensified conflict between the studio and Hunnam, who shortly thereafter threatened to drop the role of Christian Grey. The actor's team reportedly advised him to keep the gig so as not to damage relations with the studio, but his mind was apparently made up. In an effort to appease the star, Universal hired Patrick Marber (\"Closer,\" \"Notes on a Scandal\") to do some rewrites on the script -- but the next day Hunnam announced his departure. (The official reason cited was Hunnam's production schedule on \"Sons of Anarchy,\" but \"50 Shades\" is slated to begin work after production on \"Anarchy\" ends.) THR notes that general media attention also contributed to Hunnam's decision to distance himself from \"50 Shades,\" which would have netted him a $125,000 paycheck. As previously reported, reactions to the casting decision were quite divisive. Universal hired a bodyguard for Hunnam at the recent \"Sons of Anarchy\" premiere. Jamie Dornan, Christian Cooke, Alexander Skarsgard and Theo James had already been shortlisted for the", "One of the biggest ways college students are ripped off is getting out of control. But most conversations center on ballooning tuition costs, rather than a less well-known expense that strains the wallets of college students: textbooks. Since 1977, the price of college textbooks has more than tripled the rate of inflation, meaning a 1,041% rise, according to NBC News, which cites Bureau of Labor Statistics Data. \"They've been able to keep raising prices because students are 'captive consumers.' They have to buy whatever books they're assigned,\" Nicole Allen, a spokeswoman for the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, told NBC. Some publishers contest the idea that textbook prices have risen exorbitantly, claiming that what may look like stark increases in percentages actually represent more modest increases in whole dollars. Still, students and experts following the trend say that the prices are becoming prohibitively expensive. And the high prices are beginning to discourage some students from purchasing textbooks for their classes, despite the fact that they realize it may hurt their grades. The US Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) conducted a survey of 156 different college campuses across 33 states and found that 65% of students decided against buying a book required for class due to its high cost. And 94% of those students acknowledged", "Forest Whitaker's is playing a fan favorite character in 'Star Wars: Rogue One'.

Researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School found an association between regularly eating peanut butter and having a lower risk of developing benign breast disease in early adulthood. Benign breast disease is noncancerous, and occurs when there are changes to the breast or an injury or infection leads to lumps in the breast tissue. The research team did not investigate a link between peanut butter and malignant breast lumps or cancer. Other sources of vegetable fats and proteins -- such as soybeans, beans and lentils -- could also have the same effect, but researchers noted that the data on these particular foods in the study was not as abundant as data on peanut butter. It's important to note that the study only showed an association between peanut butter consumption and breast disease, and doesn't show that peanut butter can definitively prevent breast disease. The study, published in the journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, included health data on 9,039 U.S. girls ages 9 to 15 who were recruited to the Growing Up Today Study in 1996.

Grimm, a co-chair of the House Russian Caucus, issued a statement Monday condemning the two deadly bombings that took place in the past two days in Russia. Both attacks occurred in the southern city of Volgograd, and together they left at least 31 people dead. Grimm used the opportunity to drudge up memories of the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, as well as the Boston Marathon bombing in April. It was revealed after the bombing that Russia had warned the FBI about one of the two suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. \"We cannot sweep these threats under the rug, like we did with Benghazi or the warnings from Russia on the Tsarnaev brother behind the Boston Marathon bombing,\" Grimm said. \"Each time we fail to recognize these threats, we not only risk the lives of innocent Americans, but appear weaker and vulnerable in the eyes of the enemy.\" He added that each threat should be taken seriously \"so that the Winter Olympics remain a dream for athletes around the globe, instead of becoming a nightmare like Benghazi.\" While the recent bombings have indeed ignited security concerns ahead of the Sochi Olympics, the parallel to Benghazi is not", "Hot ticket: 2 Game 7 floor seats sell for $29K each.

That's how politics professor Caroline Heldman opened her Jan. 2013 TEDxYouth San Diego talk on the topic of sexual objectification. \"I'd like to talk specifically about the lie, or the idea, that being a sex object is empowering.\" Heldman explained that sexual objectification is so common that many young people struggle to even recognize it as such: \"It's like being raised in a red room, being pulled out of that room, and asked to describe the color red.\" She added that girls may grow up believing that being objectified is actually empowering because American culture teaches that to be a sex object is to be valuable. However, the consequences of objectification to society are far from positive, and side effects among women include body shame, depression, eating disorders, low self-esteem and even decreased sexual pleasure, according to Heldman: Instead of being involved and engaged in what is happening, you tend to view yourself from a third-party perspective. A spectator's perspective, where you're worried about rolls of fat hanging out, what that leg looks like... it gets in the way of sexual pleasure.

Guilt over an affair was the one regret that plagued one user who says she was otherwise a good person.

Stafford, Va. \u2014 A Florida teenager accused of pretending to be a doctor and stealing money from an 86-year-old patient faces new charges in Virginia after authorities say he fraudulently tried to buy a luxury car. Malachi Love-Robinson was arrested Friday and charged with identity theft and other fraud offenses after he attempted to purchase a Jaguar at a car dealership, Stafford County Sheriff\u2019s officials say. They said employees at Kargar Motors Car Dealership became suspicious when Love-Robinson applied for a car loan with an elderly woman as the co-signer on the loan. The employees called the sheriff\u2019s office after looking up Love-Robinson\u2019s name in an internet search. Deputies came to the car dealership and spoke with Love-Robinson, who said he came to Virginia to buy a car for himself and another for his godmother. The woman, who was not identified, later told deputies that she had not given Love-Robinson permission to be listed as a co-signer on the loan. She also told police she was unaware of recent purchases made on her credit card for two iPads. The sheriff\u2019s office says deputies seized the iPads when they arrested Love-Robinson.

On Thursday in Kentucky, the House Health and Welfare Committee passed the Cannabis Compassion Act by a 9 to 5 margin. The proposed law, HB 350, which was introduced earlier this month, would allow people with debilitating medical conditions to possess and use up to 3 ounces of weed and to grow up to 12 mature plants as long as they have a doctor's recommendation. If passed, the law would set up a regulated system of growing facilities and dispensaries to sell the drug. In Georgia, the House Health Committee voted unanimously Wednesday to pass HB 885, which would legalize marijuana extracts like cannabidiol for use in treating seizure disorders. The measure was written by a Republican lawmaker, Rep. Allen Peake, who said he changed his mind on medical marijuana after meeting a 4-year-old girl who suffered from up to 100 seizures a day. The bill has the backing of the medical community and the Georgia Sheriff's Association. It would not legalize the smoking of marijuana.

In fact, plenty of well-endowed men are ashamed of their penises, while lots of men with smaller penises strut their stuff with confidence, according to a study published online Sept. 30 in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. The findings are no surprise, said study leader David Veale, a psychiatrist at King's College London. \"It's an emotional feeling,\" Veale said of penis shame. Like other forms of body dissatisfaction, penis-size anxiety is rarely linked to reality, he told LiveScience. Measuring up Men worry far more than women about penis size, according to Veale and his colleagues. One study, published in April in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that women preferred larger penises only up to a point (anything bigger than a flaccid length of 2.99 inches (7.59 centimeters) did not additionally impress women), and preferences also varied based on a guy's height. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found similarly ambivalent female preferences. In that study, women who experienced frequent vaginal orgasms were much more likely than other women to express an interest in better-endowed guys. For women who didn't prefer vaginal orgasms, penis size was a far less pressing matter. Nevertheless, men", "Magician makes dozens of people smile with a simple trick.

The study found older people who don't get enough restful sleep have brain imaging patterns similar to people suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health looked at data from 70 adults with an average age of 76 and reported higher deposits of beta-amyloid in those who didn't sleep much or very well. Beta-amyloid is a protein found in the brain, which tends to form into clusters and eventually into plaque that is the telltale sign of Alzheimer's. Normal sleep-wake patterns actually help regulate levels of beta-amyloid. The participants reported sleeping upwards of 7 hours at the higher end, and no more than 5 hours at the lower end. Since the data was taken from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, the country's longest running study on aging, researchers say they will need to conduct further trials to know if sleep disturbance necessarily precedes beta-amyloid buildup. The study does open doors to future research studying whether or not bettering a person's sleep can prevent or delay beta-amyloid buildup and Alzheimer's progression. Other studies have also shown a link between lack of sleep and memory. Earlier this year, a study showed older adults can experience memory", "The category that 'Brooklyn' is in on Netflix will seriously annoy you.

Halfway through Thursday's slugfest it appeared Rubio would be mostly shunned by his opponents, but he used an almost two-minute segment to air a litany of Cruz's flip-flops on immigration, which Cruz parried.

Imgur \u2022 Reddit In the viral image, the woman's legs appear to be the wrong way around At first look, the image of a woman sun bathing in her bikini appears innocent - reading her book, and lying on her front, she looks relaxed and happy. However once you spot the difference, you can see that this is no ordinary image, because the woman\u2019s legs are on the wrong way. Don\u2019t worry though, this is not a freak accident, the image has simply merged an image of her lying down on her back before meshing with her as she switched over to her front.

When the Republican presidential primary was still in full swing in March, officials from Donald Trump's campaign promoted a conspiracy theory -- one of many -- insisting there was a nefarious link between his political opponents and an anti-Trump super PAC.  It began this spring when a group called Make America Awesome, an anti-Trump group, posted a photo of Trump's wife, Melania, that criticized her for posing semi-nude in a magazine photo shoot. Trump responded by crudely lambasting the physical appearance of Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, and he justified it by claiming that Cruz was behind the attack on his own wife.  As evidence, Trump's team pointed to a large donation that Carly Fiorina's super PAC received from a pro-Cruz super PAC. And Fiorina's super PAC, they noted, had the same mailing address as Make America Awesome, the group that had attacked Trump's wife. Because those groups listed the same address, they claimed it was proof that the anti-Trump forces were operating from the same source.  Trump's supporters, including his campaign's social media director, Daniel Scavino, lit up the Internet with screenshots showing the identical address: PO BOX 26141 in Alexandria, Virginia.

This is the background, though. A lot of people in Croatia have become alienated from the national team in recent years and there are large movements that have given up on it completely.

It's generally accepted that with each decade of our lives comes a new visible marker of age. To combat these tell-tale signs, dozens of \"anti-aging\" products and routines are marketed at people (mostly women) in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s. Use anti-wrinkle cream! Sleep with tea bags under your eyes! Avoid stress!, they command. As it turns out, most of these strategies don't actually do anything to keep your skin or hair healthy, according to experts. More importantly, while most of us assume there's an intrinsic link between the visible signs of aging (like wrinkles and grey hair), this idea is generally misguided. Here's what you should know about your health and the external markers of the passage of time. 1. Anti-wrinkle creams will erase the fine lines that emerge in your 20s. The myth: Anti-aging creams and lotions will \"roll back the clock\" and make fine lines disappear. Why it's bogus: According to the staff at the Mayo Clinic, anti-aging creams and lotions don't do too much for the skin's appearance. \"The benefits of these products are usually only modest at best,\" they write.

So the next time you're left wondering whether someone you know is secretly a terrible person, ask them what they think about someone else. According to a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, this will actually reveal something about their own personality because people tend to see their own traits in other people. So a kind person will probably see others as kind too, and a selfish person will see others as selfish. Dr Dustin Wood, one of the study\u2019s authors, said: A huge suite of negative personality traits are associated with viewing others negatively. The simple tendency to see people negatively indicates a greater likelihood of depression and various personality disorders. As part of the study, participants were asked to judge the characteristics of three others, both positively and negatively. The more positively they judged others, the happier and more emotionally stable the participants turned out to be. On the other hand, the participants who judged others negatively tended to be narcissistic, with higher levels of anti-social behaviour. The study explained:  ...

Pay attention to the story The score for \"Thor: The Dark World\" sounds nothing like what composer Patrick Doyle did on \"Thor,\" and there's a reason for that. \"In this film, he is fully realized,\" Tyler said, noting that the God of Thunder had gone through an entire \"Thor\" movie as well as \"Marvel's The Avengers\" before landing on \"The Dark World.\" \"We needed a mature character theme, where he's regal, he's epic, and the romance with Jane [played by Natalie Portman] is kind of melancholy, because she's this mortal that he's fallen for, which could not be further from his side of the train tracks.\" 2.

With Activision releasing a remastered Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare later this year and the rising popularity of backwards compatibility, it looks like EA might draft up some remastered Battlefield games in the future. Even though the overall production of remastered games has slowed down for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it is still something that players desire, especially when it comes to beloved games that many gamers spent hours upon hours playing on last gen consoles. Talk of remastered Battlefield games can be exciting, especially since the original title, Battlefield 1942, was only released on PC and might be a great addition to the ever-growing collection of first-person shooters available on consoles. Patrick Soderlund, EA Studios Executive Vice-President, had a recent interview with International Business Times and the topic of remastered Battlefield games was brought up. It looks like there isn\u2019t currently a remaster in the works as of yet, but if there is enough demand from fans the tables can absolutely be turned. \"I wouldn\u2019t say never. We\u2019re not doing it right now, we\u2019re focused on Battlefield 1 \u2013 but if we think the fans want that I see no reason we couldn\u2019t.\" \u2013 Patrick Soderlund Soderlund", "Guess how much Google paid the guy who briefly owned google.com. That\u2019s right, in a couple of clicks, and for the princely sum of $12, Sanmay had become the proud owner of the most famous website address in the world. However, it didn\u2019t take Google long (one minute, to be precise) to realize something had gone terribly wrong with its system, prompting it to fire off an email to Sanmay telling him it\u2019d canceled his order and refunded his purchase. After reviewing the error, Google decided to give Sanmay a financial reward for bringing the bug to its attention. Despite people\u2019s curiosity about how much Google paid the guy who momentarily owned its domain name, neither the Web giant nor Sanmay disclosed the sum. Until now, that is. Sanmay, who\u2019s currently an MBA student at Babson College in Boston, said last year the company had offered him \"a $x reward in a very Googley way,\" and now we see what he means. Sort of.

It\u2019s no secret that Mystique from the X-Men movies is totally badass. In fact, even the director of the film franchise wants the cobalt blue, shape-shifting character to have her own movie. However, getting all that body paint done isn\u2019t exactly a party, and medical experts are actually concerned with the body paint\u2019s health effects. Why? Because it\u2019s jam-packed with chemicals. \"The fact is any body paint can cause an allergic reaction if an actor\u2019s immune system has become \u2018sensitive\u2019 to a particular ingredient,\" Dr. Elizabeth Tanzi, assistant clinical professor of department of dermatology at the George Washington University Medical Center and founder of Capital Laser and Skin Care, told Hollywood Reporter. \"The longer the exposure, the higher the risk of sensitization to the ingredients in the body paint.

Golubovskis is running as a write-in candidate in the Tuesday mayoral election for the northern Michigan town, he explains in a YouTube video uploaded by a user going by \"Tyler Durdin\" that's received over 3,000 views since it was released Oct. 25. He claims to be homeless and not receiving any public assistance, but doesn't reveal much more about his circumstances. Golubovskis also purports to have two degrees from the University of Michigan, including a masters in public policy, and says he's worked in Europe, New York and D.C. in politics and the private sector. Write-in campaigns are difficult to win, but a major mistake made by current Mayor Michael Estes may have tipped the scales toward a newcomer. Estes was arrested for drunken driving on Oct. 23 after police saw his vehicle drifting out of his lane, according to MLive. Estes, 63, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.12. Estes is running against Rick Buckhalter on the official ballot, and Golubovskis is also joined by commission candidate John Reid, who filed as a write-in candidate shortly after Estes' arrest, according to the Traverse City Record-Eagle.

As a divinity school student, I had just started working as a student chaplain at a cancer hospital when my professor asked me about my work. I was 26 years old and still learning what a chaplain did. \"I talk to the patients,\" I told him. \"You talk to patients? And tell me, what do people who are sick and dying talk to the student chaplain about?\" he asked. I had never considered the question before. \"Well,\" I responded slowly, \"Mostly we talk about their families.\" \"Do you talk about God? \"Umm, not usually.\" \"Or their religion?\" \"Not so much.\" \"The meaning of their lives?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"And prayer? Do you lead them in prayer? Or ritual?\" \"Well,\" I hesitated. \"Sometimes.

That\u2019s according to a new video produced by New York Magazine\u2019s The Science of Us, based on research last year that suggested you only need one question to find out which of your friends is really, really into themselves. Just ask them upfront: \"To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement: I am a narcissist.\" Apparently this question relies on the fact that a true narcissist will be unlikely to think of their narcissism as a bad thing. In the study of over 2,000 people of all ages, participants were asked to rate themselves on a scale of 1 (not very true of me) to 7 (very true of me). \"People who are willing to admit they are more narcissistic than others probably actually are more narcissistic,\" said Brad Bushman, co-author of the study and a professor of communication and psychology at The Ohio State University. This method takes up a lot less time than the 40 question Narcissistic Personality Inventory, which was developed by Robert Raskin and Howard Terry in 1979.

The official version, found in the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees' annual report, is this:  Social Security's total income is projected to exceed its total cost through 2019, as it has since 1982. After 2019, interest income and money taken out of reserves will provide the resources needed to offset Social Security's annual deficits until 2034. By then, if Congress does nothing, the federal government will collect enough in payroll taxes to pay about 75 percent of scheduled retirement benefits until 2090.

That's up $700 billion from the $10.7 trillion the administration projected for its 2089 shortfall. Infinite horizon Despite the huge numbers, there's even a less generous way of looking at the fiscal shortfall. A projection, known as the \"infinite horizon,\" takes into account all the program's future liabilities, even those beyond the 75-year period that Social Security actuaries typically use in their calculations. Under the infinite horizon, Social Security will have $32.1 trillion in unfunded liabilities by 2090, $6.3 trillion more than last year's projection. (See the chart below.)

Overwatch has had a great launch and the servers are performing relatively well. However, there\u2019s a little bit of discomfort within members of the game\u2019s community regarding the tick rate. In case you are wondering what tick rate is, it is the rate at which the server of the game updates every second. The tick rate of a game plays an important role in the responsiveness of the game. The higher the tick rate is, the more responsive the game becomes. The players of Overwatch are currently facing several issues regarding responsiveness. There have been instances where the players have taken damage, although they were behind cover such as walls or obstacles. Also, some important commands don\u2019t work in a timely manner. Overwatch\u2018s current tick rate is 20.8hz which is very low compared to other games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive or Battefield 4 which have tick rates around 60hz. However, the game has an option which allows the tick rate to be raised up to 62.5hz in custom games with high bandwidth options in the settings, but this will not lessen the lag if you are playing with a player with low bandwidth settings.

By Ryan Mac and Matt Drange An internet troll, who was once called the most hated man on the internet and is banned from Twitter, is recommending candidates to serve in the Trump administration. Charles Chuck Johnson, a controversial blogger and conservative online personality, has been pushing for various political appointees to serve under Donald Trump, according to multiple sources close to the President-elect's transition team. While Johnson does not have a formal position, FORBES has learned that he is working behind the scenes with members of the transition team's executive committee, including billionaire Trump donor Peter Thiel, to recommend, vet and give something of a seal of approval to potential nominees from the so-called alt-right. The proximity to power is something new for Johnson, a self-described journalist, author and debunker of frauds, who has made a name for himself by peddling false information and right-wing conspiracy theories online. In the months leading up to the election, Johnson, 28, used social media and his website GotNews.com to stump for the President-elect while also publishing misinformation on Trump's detractors.

If you're trying to lose weight, you probably read nutritional labels more frequently than your Twitter feed, but if you aren't exactly sure where to begin in decoding them (or even if you think you know your way around a nutrition label at this point), this list will help you break down exactly what you should be looking at. Spoiler: Calories aren't the only thing that matters. Serving Size You might think calories are the most important thing (or maybe even the only thing) to look at on a nutrition label, but that's not entirely true: 300 calories isn't just 300 calories if there are three servings in the pack. What you think is a low-calorie meal could actually be costing you 600, or even 900 calories, if you're eating double or triple the serving size. Take a hot minute to do the math and make sure a serving size (and how many additional servings you eat) fit into your daily caloric allotment.

In Warner Bros.' 2018 take on Tomb Raider, Oscar winner Alicia Vikander embodies the title role, and she looks fierce as hell. Here's Vikander in Croft's iconic gray tank top and cargo pants, ready to fight any haters in the woods: The synopsis, according to a press release, finds Lara struggling to find herself and dealing with her father's death: Lara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen. Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class.

Secure your own mask before helping others.\" But actually gaining sight of these mysterious devices is exceedingly rare. So rare, in fact, that when United Airlines crew deployed them on a flight to Denver in 2015 after several passengers said they felt unwell, the biggest concern for those on board appeared to be documenting the event with a selfie.  So how do the masks actually work, under what circumstances are they unleashed, and how much oxygen do they contain? Is it about safety, or is it just an elaborate way to intoxicate passengers, keeping them pliant while their stricken plane plummets to Earth?

DC Comics has taken the groundbreaking step to confirm what many already suspected. Wonder Woman is queer, and she always has been. In an interview with Comicosity , writer Greg Rucka confirmed the long-overdue announcement about the superhero, otherwise known as Diana of Themyscira. But it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise to comic fans, given that Wonder Woman\u2019s island home, Themyscira, is inhabited only by women. Warner Bros.

Bloomberg probably has the most accurate reporting thus far (thanks to its hiring of Apple reporter Mark Gurman) in a report that basically confirms what has leaked out about the iPhone over the next few months.

They analyzed factors including the rate of sexually transmitted diseases, obesity and smoking (the behavioral component); the number of publicly-funded women\u2019s health services and rate of health insurance (policy); food insecurity, intimate partner violence and poverty (socio-structural) and cervical cancer screenings, dental care and vaccinations (health care). Infant health was compared on metrics like infant mortality, being breastfed, and receiving a home health visit as a baby.

Not surprisingly, millennials are also more anxious than older Americans. The APA reports that 12% of millennials have a diagnosed anxiety disorder almost twice the percentage of Boomers.

Anxiety not only harms our wellbeing but also sabotages our productivity. The ACHA assessment found that the top two tolls on students' academic performance were stress and anxiety. Two-thirds of millennials interviewed by BDA attribute declining work performance to anxiety.

There are all different kinds of tribes, of course. When it came, for instance, to the question of how you'd feel if your family member married someone with a different party affiliation, the vast majority of Americans responded that they'd feel either \"happy\" or that it \"doesn't matter.\" Even for strict partisans, this was mostly true. Strong conservatives approved of a family member marrying a Democrat 70 percent of the time and strong liberals approved of marrying a Republican 78 percent of the time. Similar numbers turned up for identity markers like \"gun ownership\" or \"went to college,\" with most people being indifferent to these factors when it comes to bringing new people to family holiday dinners.

Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy has been studying first impressions alongside fellow psychologists Susan Fiske and Peter Glick for more than 15 years, and has discovered patterns in these interactions. In her new book \"Presence,\" Cuddy says people quickly answer two questions when they first meet you: Can I trust this person? Can I respect this person? Psychologists refer to these dimensions as warmth and competence respectively, and ideally you want to be perceived as having both. Interestingly, Cuddy says that most people, especially in a professional context, believe that competence is the more important factor. After all, they want to prove that they are smart and talented enough to handle your business. But in fact warmth, or trustworthiness, is the most important factor in how people evaluate you. \"From an evolutionary perspective,\" Cuddy says, \"it is more crucial to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.\" It makes sense when you consider that in cavemen days it was more important to figure out if your fellow man was going to murder you and steal all your possessions than if he was competent enough to build a good fire.

The original Instagram icon Image: Instagram But that's not the whole story. Mashable caught up with Rise in the wake of Instagram's big change. Far from being bitter over seeing his work cast aside, Rise thinks the new icon is great, which probably isn't surprising since he's a friend and former colleague of both of Instagram's founders. SEE ALSO: Instagram just changed its logo in a big way \"I'm super psyched on the new one,\" Rise says. \"I love the minimalism. Regardless of the colors behind it, the white shape \u2014 the actual bones of the new symbol itself \u2014 is beautiful, and I think that can persist over time.\" Rise says he's also a friend of Robert Padbury, one of the", "How To Check If You've Been Hacked Within Seconds.

For the class of 2013, seven out of 10 college students nationwide carried some form of education debt when they graduated, according to the ninth annual Project on Student Debt report from the Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), a nonprofit organization. The average graduate was $28,400 in the red, the report says. In six states, students graduated with an average of more than $30,000 in education debt, and only New Mexico grads came in below the $20K mark, with an average of $18,656 in school debt. New Hampshire, Delaware and Pennsylvania had the highest average student debt loads at $32,795, $32,571 and $32,528, respectively. Pennsylvania and New Hampshire also have the most expensive public colleges in the country, according to Department of Education figures.

Eight hours a day, five days a week, every week for the past 16 months, Safo has helped operate a huge conveyor belt designed to digitize the museum's vast botany collection. Deftly, she and her two fellow digitizers place papers bearing pressed plants on the belt, pass them under a camera, snap a photo, check the image on the computer, then replace the sheets in their folder. Click, beep, whir. \"It's definitely not what I had imagined,\" admitted the 24-year-old Safo. She'd gone to Georgetown to get a master's degree in museum studies with the hope of becoming a curator.

The seemingly monotonous task turned out to be essential. \"There's a lot more that goes on behind the scenes than you think,\" Safo said. \"The fact that we all manage to stay sane is really what makes the museum run.\" The NMNH botany collection, or herbarium, is among the largest in the world, filling more than two floors", "Should get high with your pets? Blunt (yes, that's his real name) became a viral sensation when the video of him blowing marijuana smoke into his pet chameleon's mouth racked up over 500,000 views in a matter of days. Blunt claims the smoke helps calm his chameleon, whose name is Binna and who can sometimes be aggressive. After catching wind of the video, PETA filed a complaint with Chicago authorities, who arrested Blunt several days later. However, Judge Robert Kuzas ruled that Blunt's behavior, while \"really, really uncalled for and immature,\" was not criminal, as the animal showed no signs of harm. Blunt was acquitted. In Colorado and Washington, it's now completely legal for (human) adults to use marijuana. But veterinarians in these states are specifically prohibited by law from prescribing cannabis to animals, as one woman learned after driving to Colorado from Utah because she mistakenly believed she could obtain a medical marijuana prescription for her dog. There is no state in which it's legal for veterinarians to prescribe medical pot for dogs, although the Nevada legislature is debating a bill that would allow it.

This week, Robert Plomin, professor of behavioral genetics at King\u2019s College London, published a paper showing that a child\u2019s educational success can be predicted by their genes. Genetic data from 20,000 DNA variants across several genes collectively account for 10% of the differences in children\u2019s educational achievement age 16. At the most extreme ends of this genetic variation is an entire exam grade difference\u2014from A to B grade for those with the highest polygenic score, to B to C grade for those with the lowest. The notion that success at school could be so influenced by genes is uncomfortable for those who uphold the view that anyone can do or achieve anything they put their mind to. But Plomin\u2019s paper is far from the only publication showing such results. Meta-analysis of 61 twin studies shows that genetic variation accounts for 66% of educational achievement at primary school level. One set of identical twins raised apart shared many similarities\u2014including flushing the toilet before using it, wearing rubber bands on their wrists, reading magazines from back to front, and dipping their toast in coffee. And, disquieting though that may be, twin studies have time and again highlighted other aspects of ourselves that seem", "Guess how much money Bill Gross made last year? Exclusive by @ritholtz:. In 2012, news reports suggested that the firm's top 30 partners \"pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years.\" A subsequent column by Felix Salmon guessed that the average investment professional at Pimco was making \"roughly $7 million each\" annually. A Pimco spokesman denied Salmon's claim, responding that \"The numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate.\" Salmon's speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside. Actual bonuses at Pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed. Based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by Bloomberg View, it appears that Pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $1.5 billion. So how much have Pimco's top executives earned? According to documents provided to Bloomberg View by someone with knowledge of Pimco's bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013. Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to Gross, received $230 million (El-Erian is a fellow Bloomberg View contributor).

Bryant is officially done with the NBA until he comes back to play for the Wizards, so we need a clear answer. Bryant's thoughts? Doesn't matter. \"[Whichever number is chosen] it'll be pretty hard for someone else to wear the other one,\" Bryant told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. This is 100 percent accurate.

The best way to become successful at something, just like all businesses that follow an existing business do, is to take someone\u2019s recipe, copy it exactly, then improve on it. However, unlike businesses, if you copy someone\u2019s best traits and apply them to your work, you will not harm them as a consequence. It\u2019s good to take someone\u2019s principles, someone\u2019s mental dexterity and someone\u2019s personal boundaries, when they are more developed than yours, and use them yourself. After modeling those traits, you can build your own personal style over them and make them unique. I would actually argue it\u2019s impossible to truly copy someone because, regardless of how badly you want to copy a person, you will never be truly able to become identically like him or her. You will copy said person with your unique approach and your unique flair over it. In a way, trying to copy someone else exactly will lead you to discover \"your version\" of his or her traits. So, it\u2019s already an improved, or at least customized, copy from the beginning.

Though you may have come across that \"As Seen on TV\" infomercial for Spray Perfect, the company that's actually credited with revolutionizing the product is London-based company Nails Inc. Their Paint Can sprays are now available stateside in three highly pigmented shades, including Hoxton Market (a hot pink), Mayfair Lane (a pastel pink) and Shoreditch Lane (a gleaming silver). Milk Makeup and China Glaze have recently added spray-on nail polishes to their beauty lines, proving that this trend isn't going anywhere any time soon. Here's exactly how it works, demonstrated in GIFs by Nails Inc. You start by applying a base coat -- because you've got to protect your natural nails and provide a smooth surface for the pigment to adhere to. You can either use your own traditional brush-on base coat, or one that may be sold with your spray-on polish. Next, shake up the can and spray on your nail polish. Pro tip: Place a paper towel or old newspaper to prevent getting product all over the place. And be sure to hold the bottle at least 3 to 5 inches above your hand to evenly disperse the pigment.

Spicer went on the record to confront CNN in front of their colleagues in the White House during the briefing that occurred in his office.

To an obsessive observer of Pinterest trends (which I am), one thing that seems to differ between the popular pins of women and men \u2014 or at least what the company said are the popular male pins \u2014 is the overall quality of the photos and the buy-ability. That is, the photos Pinterest said men pin were more likely to be products linked to a merchandiser\u2019s site than just a photo of a person wearing that item. And while some of the most repinned photos on Pinterest at large might be a gritty shot of a beige casserole or someone\u2019s random gray hallway, the top male pins the company sent BuzzFeed Life all looked professionally produced. This could be related to Pinterest\u2019s new partnership with brands, which can promote pins targeted to certain interests or demographics, or because of Pinterest\u2019s own work to increase their number of male users by saturating the men\u2019s fashion and other traditionally masculine categories.

Despite the hype the range received, Topshop CEO Sir Philip Green announced that the partnership would be put on pause in 2010 after Moss had churned out 14 collections.

The answer to that is a definitive ... maybe. Scientists have been chipping away at the peculiarities of left-handedness, which occurs in about 10 percent of the population, for a long time. They\u2019ve looked into the purported links between left-handedness and things like mental illness, faulty immune systems, and criminal behavior. They\u2019ve studied whether lefties are better at problem-solving, and if they\u2019re more likely to die young. From all these studies on left-handedness, we can conclude one thing, and one thing alone: science is complicated. A handful of studies have found a link between left-handedness and creativity, conferred, some think, by the fact that left-handed folks constantly have to adjust to a right-handed world. Other studies found no link at all. Some researchers conclude that lefties are no smarter than righties, while others say that left-handedness comes with a clear intellectual advantage. Is there really a left-handed personality? Are lefties more prone to schizophrenia and learning disabilities? That depends on who you ask.

By the early hours of Friday 24 June, it will be clear if the UK has defied the experts and pollsters by voting to leave the European Union. If that happens, a shattered David Cameron, his leadership already a matter of speculation, will have no option but to make a statement outside 10 Downing Street saying he will respect the mandate of the British people. The Treasury, Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) will move quickly to roll out well-hidden battle plans to prevent market chaos. A shocked European political class will find itself grappling with an unprecedented, messy and sprawling divorce that could rumble on for years. The EU will respond as it does to any crisis, and convene an emergency summit, probably as early as the weekend. As the morning unfolds it will quickly become clear that although the basic Brexit procedures are set down in law with some clarity, the politics, timeframe and potentially explosive brinkmanship will bring deep uncertainty and new disputes between the Brexiters and Europe.

BAE Systems, a UK-based defense company, has unveiled plans to \"grow\" drones for warfare in a chemical process. Details are few and far between, but in a statement, the company said this relies on a machine called the \"Chemputer\". This would involve making parts from the molecular level, rather than physically making parts like a regular 3D-printer, with shape-shifting chemicals. The statement goes on to add that this will be done via \"speeding up evolutionary processes\", whatever that means. But the company says this would enable aircraft to be built in weeks, rather than the years of construction it takes at the moment. In a somewhat futuristic video, BAE seems to envisage using large vats in which autonomous drones could be grown via this process. Other parts for large manned aircraft could apparently be produced in this manner. \"The world of military and civil aircraft is constantly evolving and it's been exciting to work with scientists and engineers outside BAE Systems and to consider how some unique British technologies could tackle the military threats of the future,\" said Professor Nick Colosimo, a BAE Systems Global Engineering Fellow, in the statement. It certainly sounds rather, uh, fantastic. But as Mashable points out,", "Cheap, widely available drug could stop thousands of mothers bleeding to death. A cheap and widely available drug could save the lives of thousands of women who die in childbirth from excessive bleeding, one of the main killers of women worldwide. The drug, tranexamic acid, is available over the counter in the UK to women suffering from heavy periods. In Japan and the far east, it is used as a skin whitener. But now a very large study of 20,000 women in 21 countries has shown it can stop a third of cases of bleeding to death after giving birth. Haemorrhage after childbirth kills 100,000 women a year, mostly in low and middle-income countries. \"It is not only the women dying \u2013 it is the impact on the child that has to grow up without a mother, children who might already be in the family and the husband,\" said associate professor Haleema Shakur from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led the trial. \"This is of absolutely huge importance. While a single mother is dying, we need to keep fighting for them.\" The drug has already been proven to cut the death toll from bleeding after accidents in a trial of similar size.

A scenario often presented to introductory physics classes is that of a \"gravity tunnel\" \u2014 a tube drilled from one side of the Earth to the other through the planet's center. The answer taught for nearly a half-century for how long a fall through such a hole would take was about 42 minutes and 12 seconds. The solution to this problem depends on the strength of Earth's gravitational pull, which in turn is based on its mass. As one falls through the planet, there is less mass beneath whoever is making the descent over time, so the force of the gravity experienced would lessen as one approached Earth's center. [What If? 22 Crazy Hypothetical Questions (and their Answers)] Still, assuming no air resistance, the momentum from the fall could sling one all the way to the surface on the other side. Anyone making the fall would have to make sure to get away from the exit hole as soon as they flew out of it, or else they could drop in again, hurtling back and forth inside the gravity tunnel, like a weight swinging at the end of a pendulum. \"I guess you can imagine it like a waterslide that takes", "Is This The Reason Why India\u2019s Marathon Sensation Budhia Singh Is \u2018Refusing\u2019 To Return To SAI...

Amazon is now the biggest seller of clothes online in the US, with its apparel sales totaling $16.3 billion last year, Bloomberg reports. That's more than the combined online sales of Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, Gap, and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands in the same period, according to Bloomberg. Amazon is now second only to Walmart in terms of overall apparel market share, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. The company's rise as a leader in apparel sales has been swift and relatively quiet. Amazon made one of its first major pushes into the category 10 years ago with the purchase of the clothing website ShopBop. Three years later, Amazon bought the online shoe retailer Zappos for $850 million. Over the past couple of years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first New York Men's Fashion Week. The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Julie Gilhart, the Barneys New York fashion director whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and vogue editor Caroline Palmer.

Taking a common kind of painkiller is linked to an increased risk of heart failure, a study suggests. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen and diclofenac, are commonly used to treat pain and inflammation. The British Medical Journal study looked at 10 million people, aged 77 on average, who took the drugs. UK experts said the findings had little relevance for most under-65s but were a possible concern for elderly patients. The study analysed data for the 10 million users - who were from the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany - and compared them with people who did not take the drugs. The researchers, from University of Milano-Bicocca in Italy, found taking NSAIDs increased the risk of being taken to hospital with heart failure by 19%. Since most people in the study were older - and those on NSAIDs were, in general, in poorer health - UK experts said the findings had very little relevance for most under-65s but may be a concern for elderly patients.

Part of the speculation about increased activity comes from two earthquakes about 32 miles west of the park's boundary last week: one was magnitude 4.3 on June 13 followed by a 4.0 on June 14. In February, Jackson was hit with a 4.0 as well. In the last five years, according to USGS data, there was only one other earthquake within roughly the same distance with a magnitude of 4.0 or higher. (Note: Yellowstone National Park reports that the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem actually saw five alone in 2010.) So, we spoke with the Wyoming Geological Survey to find out if activity has gotten crazier. The answer is: no, no it hasn't. If anything, Yellowstone's significant seismic activity decreased significantly over the last 60 years. Wyoming Geological Survey's Division Manager of Groundwater and Geologic Hazards and Mapping, Seth Wittke, says that those quakes were likely caused by geologic features unrelated to the Yellowstone caldera. Wittke said anything outside of a 10-mile radius from the park boundary is likely unconnected. In 1959, a 7.3-7.5 magnitude earthquake hit Hebgen Lake in Yellowstone, which spurred significant aftershocks for the next few decades. In the 1960s, Wittke said there were 32 earthquakes that measured over 4.0", "Do grilled-cheese lovers have better sex? This wonk will tell you the answer. John H.

In laying on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's first goal against Swansea, this afternoon, Rooney registered his fourth assist of the season, which is double the amount Mesut Ozil currently has to his name for the current campaign. Ozil has made a name for himself with his ability to assist his Arsenal teammates, claiming his second of the season during the North London derby, today.

Over half has shown signs of depression Research into children\u2019s wellbeing suggests that today\u2019s kids are more anxious than those of generations past. What\u2019s more is that this has ramifications not only on their academic success and overall happiness, but also on their health. Dr. Stuart Slavin, a professor based at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine, believes that excessive emphasis on academic success has resulted in an unprecedented epidemic of anxiety and depression in adolescents. Dr. Slavin undertook a survey in which he asked 1400 students from Irvington High School, Silicon Valley, about their mental wellbeing. He administered two commonly-used tools for assessing mental health, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. He was shocked to discover that over half of the participants showed signs of moderate or severe depression, and over three-quarters struggled with anxiety. Furthermore, these figures may not even tell the full story because some of these students missed the opportunity to take the survey, in order to sit and write school exams. Teenagers feel as stressed as adults Traditionally, high-pressure academic environments and resulting mental health issues were thought to be the preserve of elite institutions attended by middle and upper-class", "Zlatan Ibrahimovic Shirt Number Revealed.

Imagine if we could be like plants, lying outside all day soaking up sweet, sweet energy from the sun. Doesn\u2019t sound like a bad life, does it? So why aren\u2019t the world\u2019s best minds figuring out how to hack photosynthesis into humans? It turns out there are a lot of reasons, which are spelled out in a new video by the American Chemical Society. First, there are aesthetics to consider: your cells would have to be packed with light-harvesting pigments called chlorophyll, meaning you\u2019d be bright green, or maybe a custom-tailored shade of red or blue. (Although I\u2019m pretty sure you wouldn\u2019t have ivy sprouting out of your forehead.) But far more problematic than your skin\u2019s unusual hue is the energetics of photosynthesis. Eating sunlight isn\u2019t all that efficient\u2014plants are only able to put a few percent of the energy packed away in the sun\u2019s rays to work. For your average tree, that translates to about 200 calories a day.

Then You See What's On The Floor Next To Them... You may even ask yourself the question \u2014 what would I do for them in return? For 24-year-old Graham McMillan, the answer is simple: there is simply no limit to what he would do for his friends. So, when his buddy Danny Kolzow, a 23-year-old nurse at Baylor All Saints in Fort Worth, TX, found himself in need of a kidney, McMillan didn\u2019t hesitate to find out if he could donate one of his. As it turned out, he was a match! He decided to surprise his friend with the good news, and did so in the most incredible way. In this emotional clip, McMillan walks into the hospital where Kolzow works. He has balloons and a sign in hand that reads, \"Heard urine need of a kidney, want mine?\" It seems like the young man is quite the jokester! The moment Kolzow sees him, he understandably breaks down into tears. He can barely believe his good luck: not only does he get a kidney, but he knows that he also has a great friend who will be by his side through thick and thin.

By Lynn Andriani Start With Your Wardrobe David Weinrot, chief marketing officer at the coupon code site Tada!, says apparel is the top category for sitewide coupon codes (flowers and home goods are big, too), since there's so much inventory and retailers constantly need to make room for new items. Clothing is also where you'll find the biggest discounts, says Daniel Washburn, general manager of another coupon-code site, Coupon Mountain. While some sites broadcast a \"25% off today only!\" coupon code at the top of their home page, more use coupon sites (which get a commission of about 5 percent when you click on a code) to get the word out. There are a couple of tricks to finding these money-saving treasures, aside from searching for a store name with a term like \"coupon\" or \"coupon code,\" says Sarah Jones, coupon editor at DealNews.com. For clothing, she searches the brand name and style name (e.g., \"Michael Kors Chain Lace-Up Shirtdress\") plus the word \"coupon.\" Then she searches for coupons for stores that sell the item, to see what they are currently offering. The idea is to do a mix of general and specific searches to see what comes up.

It\u2019s not a step down and it\u2019s not an add-on, either. It\u2019s a lifelong relationship you have with your body and with your own sexuality.\" Sometimes you want an orgasm, know exactly how to get it, and knock it out of the way. Which, great. But if you have trouble orgasming, you might actually be trying too hard to get yourself off, says Britton. In that case, move away from goal-centered masturbation to take the pressure off and just focus on pleasuring yourself without worrying about whether or not you get off. Orgasms from vibrators = great. But if you're someone who doesn't have any medical issues making your clitoris less sensitive (we'll get to that in a bit), getting to know your body without a toy can be informative and lead to orgasms you didn't know you could have. \"Learn your baseline, and then you can go wild,\" says Britton.

The regulations call for farmers to register and pay a $200 annual fee in addition to $1 for every acre of hemp planted and plants will be regularly inspected to make sure that the hemp contains no more than .3 percent THC, according to a report from The Denver Post. Next week, the hemp advisory committee that created the rules will turn them in for approval by Colorado's Department of Agriculture. Marijuana's sober sister contains little to no THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana associated with the \"high\" sensation and has dozens of uses including paper, oils, cosmetics and textiles. For hundreds of years in the U.S., hemp was grown and used to make rope, sails, lamp oil and clothing. American industrial hemp production peaked in 1943, with more than 150 million pounds on 146,200 harvested acres. But then production dropped to zero in the late 1950s over \"anti-drug sentiment and competition from synthetic fibers,\" according to the Associated Press. The passage of Amendment 64 in Colorado last November, which famously legalized marijuana for recreational use by adults, also allows for the commercial growing of hemp.

A six-minute video on the website of the Tribun Timur publication shows villagers slicing open the python's carcass to reveal the legs and torso of the dead victim, named Akbar. Junaedi, the secretary of Salubiro village in West Sulawesi province, told The Associated Press that villagers began searching for Akbar on Monday night after realising he hadn't returned from working on his palm oil crops the previous day. Junaedi said Wednesday that the search party found scattered palm oil fruit, a picking tool and a boot, and then spotted the engorged 7-metre (23-foot) -long reticulated python. When its stomach was cut, we first saw his boot and legs near the neck, He said. It seems he was attacked from behind because we found a wound on his back. Reticulated pythons grab onto their prey with dozens of sharp curved teeth and then squeeze it to death before swallowing it whole. They are widespread in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. Reports of humans being killed by pythons are extremely rare. In the wild they are known to eat monkeys, pigs and other mammals.

So, tonight I'll just be like, 'Can you verbally explain to me what's happening?' But we'll shoot it next year. Studios and filmmakers are constantly looking for ways to prevent details about their upcoming projects leaking to the public, and one could see this being a very effective way. Sure, one can imagine that there's a risk of some material getting scrambled if stuff isn't being written down, but not putting anything in texts, emails or memos means that nobody is going to see material they aren't going to see (and at the most extreme level, it's safe from hackers).

A just-published investigation of @RealDonaldTrump\u2019s more than 27 million Twitter followers by Bloomberg Businessweek found that about 28 percent are \"eggs.\" Literally, that means, for one reason or another, about 7.5 million followers have opted to stick with the default profile illustration, rather than adding their own photo. (Until earlier this month, Twitter\u2019s default illustration was an egg, hence the name.) But in practice, the most suspect account on Twitter is the egg. All too many of these accounts are launched by people who don\u2019t want to be identified or even associated with what they\u2019re saying. \"Eggs\" are the internet equivalent of someone who doesn\u2019t stand by their work. Twitter dropped the icon because it had become synonymous with trolls and bullying. Bloomberg also found that Trump\u2019s most vociferous supporter \u2015 in terms of tweeting at the president \u2015 is probably a bot (although not technically an egg): Trump\u2019s most prolific respondent, @Trump2016_Fan, has posted more than 18,000 times in the past year, mostly all-caps messages of support for the 45th president.

Mick Hussin was on holiday in Byron Bay, New South Wales enjoying a beer when he saw a pack of dogs chase a wallaby joey into a nearby creek, according to NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service (WIRES). Hussin jumped into the creek and was able to grab the animal by the tail and pull it to shore. Hussin cupped his hands into a funnel and began performing CPR on the joey. \"I thought I might've been wasting my time, but I thought I would keep trying anyway,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"After ten minutes of performing CPR, the wallaby's hands started to move. It was the greatest feeling when I saw its paws move,\" Hussin said according to a WIRES press release. Hussin dried the wallaby and wrapped it in towels before contacting WIRES. \"It is sad that a few seconds and the ability to deliver CPR is the difference between life and death.

The term modern sporting rifle, evoking outdoorsy competition and good, clean fun, sounds incongruous when applied to weapons like these, unless you are prepared to argue that man is the most dangerous game. So what in the world is a modern sporting rifle? And why is the term used to refer to weapons such as the Sig MCX and the AR-15?

Researchers from the Duke University School of Medicine examined the HPV subtypes present in 572 people who were part of the Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Cohort Study, all of whom had abnormal Pap tests. Of those women, 280 were African American and 292 were white. They looked particularly at HPV subtypes present in the women's cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN), which are abnormalities in the cervix that are considered precursors to cervical cancer. They wanted to see what differences there may be in early CIN (called CIN1) and more advanced CIN (called CIN2 and CIN3). Among the women with early CIN, HPV subtypes 16, 18, 31, 56 39 and 66 were the most frequently detected among white women. For African American women, though, the HPV subtypes 33, 35, 58 and 68 were most frequently detected. And among the women with advanced CIN, subtypes 16, 18, 33, 39 and 59 were the most common among white women. For African American women, subtypes 31, 35, 45, 56, 58, 66 and 8 were most frequently detected.

Dr. Catherine Spong, a practicing obstetrician-gynecologist and acting director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, says a woman\u2019s immune system is considered more vulnerable when she is pregnant. But as long as the pool water is well maintained, evidence favors taking a dip. A 2010 study conducted in Denmark and published in the journal Epidemiology aimed to answer the question \"Is Swimming During Pregnancy a Safe Exercise? by comparing swimming, bicycling and no exercise. Swimming is considered an ideal activity for pregnant women, the study found. There was no indication that swimming in pool water \"is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes.\" A more recent study, published in 2013 in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, cited concerns that either water-borne pathogens or methods of disinfecting pool water might increase the risk of birth defects. But the data found no positive association between pool use and birth defects, which the authors called \"reassuring.\" Most recently, a report issued in December from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists presented swimming as a safe physical activity for pregnant women.

The next 2.5 years went into the development of a product that would be effective and economical as compared to the bulky devices available in the market. With seed funding from the university and other investors, NeoLight has developed a black sleep slab (similar to a chopping board) which can run on battery or solar. \"It is 43% quicker than existing", "The True Meaning Of \"Macarena\" Will Horrify Every '90s Kid. In the summer of 1996, no one could avoid \"Macarena\" by the pop and dance duo Los del Rio. The song was catchy. The dance was downright infectious. But did you ever actually listen to the lyrics? It begins in the first verse, right after the lyrics \"When I dance they call me Macarena, and the boys they say \u2018que estoy buena\u2019...\" Macarena is a siren, enticing young men to come and dance with her. If they can manage to curry her favor, she may even take them home with her. So far, nothing too unusual, right? Just a woman out on the town. But then things get a little more explicit in the second verse: ...then the singer laughs a sinister, horrifying laugh. What comes next is anyone\u2019s guess? (SEX???!!! INFIDELITY???!!!) In any event, we now know that Macarena has a boyfriend and makes no secret of playing around on the side. Then at the end of the second verse, it becomes totally clear what\u2019s happening: Wait...TWO GUYS?! At ONCE?! So to summarize, \"Macarena\" is about a woman who waits until her boyfriend leaves town and then bangs his two best friends at the same time. Finally, after 20 years,", "How long does sex normally last? A scientist, though, would phrase the same question in an almost comically obscure way: What is the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time? I know there\u2019s a lot more to sex than putting the penis into the vagina and ejaculating, but the rest is not always easy to define (kissing? Rubbing? Grinding?). To keep things simple and specific, we\u2019ll just focus on the time to ejaculation. Measuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter. What about just asking people how long they take, you say? Well, there are two main problems with this. One is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it\u2019s socially desirable to say you go long into the night. The other problem is that people don\u2019t necessarily know how long they go for. Sex isn\u2019t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making. What does the research say? The best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period \u2013 using a stopwatch.

As head of one of America\u2019s largest independent financial research firms, Mr. Stansberry\u2019s work back in 2008 led him to a bold, but worrisome, conclusion: He predicted that the world\u2019s largest mortgage bankers\u2013Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which at the time were responsible for nearly 50% of all the mortgages in America\u2013would soon go bankrupt. In fact, in June of 2008, while their stock prices were still trading at well over $20 per share, Stansberry published a report to his customers titled: \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Are Going to Zero.\" Inside this report, Stansberry explained: \"For those of you who don\u2019t work in the financial industry, it might be hard for you to immediately grasp what\u2019s so dangerous about the extreme amount of leverage employed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

A recent report from the financial literacy center at Champlain College compiled state and national data to assess the big picture when it comes to Americans\u2019 financial behaviors. The results were pretty dismal. Americans across the country are struggling to stick with basic and healthy financial habits, such as saving, reducing debt or paying their bills on time. John Pelletier, director of the financial literacy center at Champlain College, said that even the highest rated states likely have some room for improvement. Here are some of the key areas in which Americans may be making some costly mistakes when it comes to money: Not paying their bills on time. About one in five people have been more than 60 days late in paying their mortgage, credit card or other bills tracked on credit reports, according to the study, suggesting that a substantial share of consumers are struggling to keep up with their bills, Pelletier said.

The conservative pundit blasted House Republicans as \"sell outs\" in a column on Wednesday for crafting guidelines on immigration that would create a mechanism to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants, saying that the growing Latino population will \"wreck the country.\" \"Leave aside the harm cheap labor being dumped on the country does to the millions of unemployed Americans,\" Coulter writes. \"What does it mean for the Republican Party?\" Casting aside conventional wisdom, Coulter says that embracing immigration reform would make the Republican Party lose voters. She argues that Latinos and other immigrant groups, particularly Asians, are so liberal on issues including Obamacare, gun control and the role of government that they\u2019ll never vote in large numbers for Republicans. Coulter refuses to acknowledge public opinion on the immigration issue, writing: \"The only ones opposed to our current immigration policies are the people.\" In fact, polls routinely show that a majority of Americans support immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented -- a more liberal stance than the one released this week by House Republicans, which would only create a pathway to legal residence.

Hamas security forces violently dispersed the protesters, with shots fired in the air to clear the crowds and a number of protesters and local journalists assaulted. The unusual protest near Gaza's most densely populated place - the Jebaliya refugee camp - was one of the largest unauthorised and unplanned protests since Hamas reinforced its power in the strip in 2007, when it removed officials from the Fatah movement.

At the same time, Snyder vetoed another bill that would have prohibited insurance companies from providing abortion coverage as a standard option and instead would have forced consumers to purchase an additional rider for abortion coverage. \"It just went too far,\" Snyder said about the bill.

If the Board of Canvassers approves the signatures, with a required minimum of 258,088, the legislators have 40 days to act. And if they pass the legislation, they do not need Snyder's signature for it to become law. It would also not be subject to a voter referendum.

The Reddit user that proposed the theory, Senor_Schnarf, argued that Szyslak is simply a family friend of the Simpsons and goes along with Bart\u2019s pranks given he\u2019s a lonely man who enjoys making the kid happy. The most compelling evidence is that Bart\u2019s phone calls to the bar are typically in the same exact voice \u2015 every time \u2015 and follow a beyond obvious joke structure. Szyslak also always goes out of his way to make the joke land. As an example, in the Season 1 episode \"Some Enchanted Evening,\" Bart calls Moe\u2019s bar and asks, \"Hello, is Al there? ... Al. Last name: Coholic.\" In that call, Moe could simply ask if there\u2019s a Mr. Coholic or an Al, but instead yells, \"Phone call for Al. Al Coholic. Is there an Al Coholic here?\" The running joke of Bart pranking Moe is one of the show\u2019s most iconic bits. If this theory is true, you would definitely need to go back and re-watch all", "This is how much an average wedding now costs in America. Surveying around 16,000 American couples, the Knot 2014 Real Weddings Study also found that 45% of weddings exceed a couple's budgets and, more worryingly, 23% lack a budget altogether. Most brides spent an average of $1,357 alone on their wedding dress. At the same time, guest lists are shrinking even as costs rise. \"The average wedding now has 136 guests, down from 149 in 2009,\" says the Knot's Rebecca Dolgin. The cheapest place to tie the knot was Utah, where couples spent only $15,000 on the big day in 2014.

The \"NERD\" fund, an acronym for \"New Energy to Reinvent and Diversify Fund,\" is a nonprofit, but all the donors' names have been kept anonymous from the public. Gov. Snyder testified in bankruptcy court last week that he did not know any of their identities. \"There\u2019s an independent board that does that work,\" Snyder said under oath, according to the Detroit News. In 2011, the secretive fund raised more than $1.3 million. But there's been a sharp drop-off in donations for 2012, with only $368,000 being raised, according to a copy of the 2012 IRS return obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, told The Huffington Post that the fund had \"had simply become an unnecessary distraction.\" But she was confident that it had obeyed applicable state and federal laws, none of which require donor names to be disclosed, and \"all state and federal tax and election laws and regulations were met and followed closely.\" She confirmed that a new fund to solicit donations \"will go far above and beyond what the law requires\" -- including full disclosure of donors, gift amounts and expenditure details.

Two weeks later and I'm not only caught up in preparation for Season 5's return on Sunday (September 29 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS), but I've become well-versed on the political-legal style evolution of Julianna Margulies' character Alicia Florrick. We've watched Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin's image evolve in the public eye -- everything from their pant suits to their hairstyles and lipstick colors have been profiled. And Margulies' fictional portrayal of a woman who stands by her man during trying times reinforces our attraction to what's on the surface. So how does one bring this element of reality to television? I dialed up \"The Good Wife\" costume designer Daniel Lawson to probe deeper into this theory. Read on to find out what it takes to style one of the most powerful women on the small screen, as well as Lawson's top tips on what we can learn from the ladies and men of Lockhart/Gardner.

Moments like Usain Bolt celebrating after winning his 100-meter sprint, Simone Biles springing to new heights and the refugee team chasing their Olympic dream made fans around the world stop their daily activities and watch. Although 7.5 million tickets were sold to the Games, many people in the Brazilian capital watched on small screens in public spaces.

A number of Olympians - including the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, Michael Phelps - have been photographed with large red circles on their skin. What are they, and why is everyone suddenly going dotty over them? The mark of an Olympic athlete, at least at Rio 2016, seems to be a scattering of perfectly round bruises. Swimmers and gymnasts, particularly from Team USA, are among those seen sporting the mysterious dots. No, not paintballing misadventures or love bites - they are the result of a practice known as \"cupping\"; an ancient therapy where heated cups are placed on the skin. So how is 'cupping' done? The technique, which is a form of acupuncture, is done by lighting flammable liquid in a glass cup. Once the flame goes out, the drop in temperature creates suction which sticks the cups to the body. The suction pulls the skin away from the body and promotes blood flow - and leaves those red spots, which typically last for three or four days. Why are some Olympians using it? Athletes say they are using it to ease aches and pains, and to help with recovery from the physical toil of constant training and", "After Reading This, You Will NEVER Put Toilet Paper On The Toilet Seat \u2013 EVER AGAIN (Do this... The truth is you should never put toilet paper on a toilet seat. Although many people believe that public toilets are teeming with bacteria and intestinal diseases, modern toilets are designed to prevent just that. Gastrointestinal or sexually transmitted infections were once thought to spread through toilet seat-skin contact, but science has refuted this. In fact, the skin on our butts is an effective protection against bacteria, according to scientists. \"Toilet seats are not a vehicle for the transmission of any infectious agents\u2014you won\u2019t catch anything,\" William Schaffner, professor and infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told the Huffington Post. It\u2019s also a good idea to rethink placing toilet paper on the toilet seat. Unlike toilet seats, paper is an ideal carrier for all kinds of bacteria. So you when you lay down some paper, pick it up again when you\u2019re done, and then probably touch your face, you\u2019re likely exposing yourself to more bacteria. The same applies to flushing the toilet. The handle is used by people who have just completed their \"business,\" making it a breeding ground for bacteria. Additionally, people forget to close the lid when they flush the toilet, which can spread bacteria around the", "\"Game of Thrones\" star comes out as gay.

If that isn\u2019t reason enough to get to the doctor if you think even remotely you may have a clot forming, nothing else will persuade you.

Variety reports that the 31-year-old actor, who currently stars on ABC's \"Once Upon a Time,\" will take over for Charlie Hunnam in the buzzy role. Dornan was among the actors shortlisted for the part after Hunnam bowed out almost two weeks ago, with some reports labeling him the frontrunner. Others speculated that \"True Blood\" star Alexander Skarsgard was the top choice, while Theo James (\"Golden Boy,\" \"Divergent\"), Christian Cooke (U.K.'s \"Where the Heart Is,\" \"Magic City\") and Scott Eastwood (\"Chicago Fire\") almost emerged as contenders. Negotiations are now underway, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Dornan reportedly read for the part late last week, as did Tony nominee and \"As the World Turns\" star Billy Magnussen. Both read opposite Dakota Johnson, who is set to play female lead Anastasia Steele. Hunnam, who originally cited scheduling conflicts on \"Sons of Anarchy\" as the reason for his departure, was set to make a $125,000 for the gig.

We should be doing more of it throughout the day, but it's our bathroom handwashing habits that have been carefully studied -- and they are disgusting. The simple step is something many consider unnecessary in communal spaces, from your office restroom to bar bathrooms. Some people go so far as to turn on the sink and let the water run, so it only sounds like they're washing their hands. When researchers hid in a public restroom in a Michigan college town, they reported that 10 percent of people didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom, and nearly one in four just rinsed with water. The average handwashing time? Six seconds, far short of the CDC's recommendation for a 20-second scrub.

The 49ers had four quarterbacks on their roster going into Saturday, and it was pretty clear that at least one of them was going to cut. In the end, coach Chip Kelly decided to dump rookie Jeff Driskel and keep Kaepernick. The move by Kelly wasn't a complete surprise. The 49ers coach has said all along that if he kept Kaepernick, it would be a football decision that would be unrelated to his protest of the national anthem. In the week leading up to cut day, Kelly made it clear that he thought Kaepernick was one of the two best quarterbacks on his roster. The decision to keep Kaepernick raises some interesting questions going forward. For one, Kaepernick's contract now becomes an issue. If the quarterback plays at all in 2016 and gets injured, then his 2017 base salary of $14.5 million would automatically become guaranteed.

Today hard cider accounts for roughly 1% of the US beer market, according to Dan Rowell, CEO of the Vermont Hard Cider Company, whose Woodchuck Hard Cider is one of the top-selling American brands. But Rowell and other cider makers are witnessing a veritable boom in business, perhaps owing to a deepening interest in craft brews and the wave of adults seeking gluten-free alternatives. Like beverages brewed from grains, fermented apple juice comes in many tastes, and it\u2019s just as ripe for small-scale, local appeal. Rowell recently told the Los Angeles Times that he predicts cider will capture 5% of the beer market before 2020. A new Woodchuck Hard Cider processing facility opened in Vermont in August; it\u2019s 100,000 square feet and reportedly can fill and cap 600 bottles of cider a minute. Since 2009, hard cider has been the fastest-growing segment in the alcoholic beverage industry. Accordingly, big companies like MillerCoors and Heineken are getting in on cider pressing.

But they are designed and created by Amazon, with all the profits going straight to the company. Amazon has sold private-label products before, including toilet paper and batteries, but this is its first foray into food. And it makes total sense. For a start, the market is huge. The global food retail market last year was $2.14 trillion, according to data compiled by Statista. When we narrow this down to just private-label foodstuffs sold in the US, it is still a whopping $80-billion-a-year opportunity (via data from the Private Label Manufacturers Association). In Europe, one in every three dollars spent in the consumer-packaged-goods market is on private-label content, Nielsen says.

Indeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was \"half-dead\" when they first met. And so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in St. Petersburg. Consequently, Longo christened the critter Biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. Clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major TLC. However, without an inkling of even which species Biscuits belonged to, Longo didn\u2019t have the first idea about how best to raise her. So, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online. First, Longo went to Reddit to ask the website\u2019s online community for help.

The action-thriller starring Matt Damon as former CIA assassin Jason Bourne brought an unprecedented closure to the famed Las Vegas Strip for the spectacular car chase. Things went boom, cars got clobbered. This is especially clear in the Jason Bourne trailer when a SWAT truck driven by Vincent Cassel (known only as The Asset) rolls through Vegas and cars going after Damon's Bourne.

And how did he know that number so quickly? \"I counted, I had to pay the bills,\" said Marshall, adding that these were just the destroyed cars from the scene. \"They are all in a trash heap somewhere.\" Producer Frank Marshall attends the Las Vegas premiere of 'Jason Bourne.'

Some Hollywood careers are composed of phases so disparate, real mental effort is required to link them together. Such is the case with Raven-Symone\u0301, who has recently enjoyed a high-profile second act as the resident firebomb-thrower on ABC\u2019s The View. Given her tendency to rankle the Twitterverse with rambling pronouncements about ethnic-sounding names, among other hot topics, it\u2019s hard to remember she entered the public eye at 3 years old as the beloved Olivia Kendall on season six of The Cosby Show.

Instinctually, Ellison thought something was wrong with her; after all, she was 25, newly married and used to have a perfectly fine libido. But doctors visits and libido boosting herbs did nothing. Medically she was fine. Ellison found herself in a position that so many couples do -- she was in a sexless marriage, and she didn't know what to do about it. Then she had an epiphany: \"I actually thought I did not have a sex drive at all ... then I just realized that it was my willingness to have sex,\" Ellison explained to Huffington Post Live's Caitlyn Becker. \"I was really in denial, I thought it was more conformable to blame myself than to analyze the health of our relationship.\" Indeed, the now-divorced Ellison discovered that it was the relationship with her husband that was the problem -- not her libido.

Her mother is just now publicizing the story to help others avoid the same situation. According to CJAD, Ducre-Lemay and her boyfriend had been out at a party earlier that night, which is why she didn't have her medication or her Medic Alert bracelet on her.

He attempted to give her CPR before the ambulance arrived. Emergency crews attempted to resuscitate her with epinephrine, but failed.

Parents are better off being emotionally warm towards children - the study says - which leads to higher self-esteem but not narcissim.  The study is the first of its kind to follow children from the ages of 7-11, the critical time when narcissistic tendencies emerge.  It followed 565 children in the Netherlands and tested typical personality traits of narcissist, such as 'thinking you are better than people' Professor Brad Bushman, one of the study\u2019s authors, said: Children believe it when their parents tell them that they are more special than others.

I\u2019m careful not to do that now. It is important to express warmth to your children because that may promote self-esteem, but overvaluing them may promote higher narcissism The same researchers had previously caught out parents who overvalued their children.

It was announced a while back that the actor planned to retire from his role as the Adamantium Antihero following one last run in the third and final solo Wolverine movie, which is currently slated to hit theaters next year. Over the course of his career with the X-Men, Jackman became practically synonymous with his character, meaning that it will be nearly impossible for the studio to just hand his role over to a new actor. However, considering how lucrative the hero has proven himself to be in the past, and that Fox hit the big red reset button on the whole universe not that long ago, the studio may already be planning to do just that.

The leader of the armed group that took over a federal wildlife reserve in Oregon last January is complaining about what he says is a big injustice: the lack of Internet access inside his jail cell. Ammon Bundy and his brother Ryan Bundy have requested Internet access in jail to help them prepare for a Sept. 7 federal trial, the Oregonian reported. The two brothers are among 26 defendants indicted on federal conspiracy and weapons charges related to the 41-day armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon. The occupation began Jan. 2, with Bundy and others demanding the federal government turn public lands over to local control. The Bundy brothers are arguing that they cannot sufficiently prepare for their Sept. 7 trial, alleging a violation of their civil rights, according to the newspaper.

DNews neatly wraps up all the latest science on the benefits of sleeping au naturale in this recent short video. The logic behind it is fairly simple \u2013 we sleep better at slightly lower body temperatures, and the less clothing, the less heat. A very slight increase in temperature can increase activity in areas of the brain that regulate sleep cycles, resulting in a more disturbed sleep. Studies have shown that a decrease even as tiny as 0.4\u00b0C (1.1\u00b0F) can make all the difference. For guys, that temperature drop can help increase your sperm count, since sperm is best produced at temperatures just below our core body temperature. For women, being free from restrictive clothing can allow your private bits to air and cool, which is important since harmful bacteria can easily thrive in warm and moist areas. Sleeping naked with a partner also has its biochemical benefits. Skin-to-skin contact is proven to increase the release of oxytocin, the so-called \"love hormone\", which can boost your mood, help maintain your immune system, and even spark feelings of emotional intimacy.

Scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes diabetes. They think that type 1 diabetes is a disease in which your immune system attacks your own cells as if they were foreign invaders. This is called an autoimmune disease. In type 1 diabetes, your immune system attacks your pancreas cells and destroys their ability to make insulin. Most scientists believe that an environmental factor, such as a virus, triggers this process in your body. Your genes play a role as well. Certain people are more prone to develop diabetes. Likewise, health experts don\u2019t fully understand what causes type 2 diabetes. They do know that it is closely linked to obesity and it tends to run in families.

The quibble was revealed in The Good Pub Guide 2017, which says that their readers have constantly railed against noisy drinking holes throughout the publication\u2019s 35-year history. They\u2019re now warning publicans to \u2018turn off the music, it\u2019s driving your customers mad\u2019. Fiona Stanley, The Good Pub Guide editor, said: \u2018Piped music, canned music, muzak, lift music, airport music - call it what you will, it\u2019s there and our readers loathe it in any shape or form. \u2018It enlists bitter complaints from our readers and has done so ever since we started the guide 35 years ago. \u2018It\u2019s such an issue that we have always asked every Main Entry pub since 1983 whether or not they have it, and then clearly state this in each review.\u2019 One pub-goer who contributed to the guide, advised: \u2018At best it\u2019s bad manners foisting a random choice of music on you that you have not chosen and do not want to hear, at worst, it interferes with people\u2019s hearing.\u2019 View photos Another said: \u2018People go to pubs to meet their friends, be sociable, have a drink or a meal and discuss the problems of the world.\u2019 But not all publicans are willing to listen to their", "Dad Puts Boiled Crayons Through A Pasta Strainer. Wait Until You See What He Does With Them!! He knew there had to be a better use for these discarded crayons, and that gave him the idea to start The Crayon Initiative. Along with volunteers, Bryan collects unwanted crayons from restaurants and schools near his home in San Francisco. These crayons are sorted, then melted, and finally, are strained into molds Bryan developed himself. The molds make crayons that are larger than the originals, for good reason \u2013 these newly recycled crayons are headed for hospitals to be used by young and special needs children. Bryan and his volunteers are proud of the result. Children are known for their imaginations and creativity, which are hallmarks of growing up and learning. Using their imaginations is also a great way to get these kids to shift their focus away from their suffering. As you\u2019ll see, the children in the hospitals who receive The Crayon Initiative\u2019s gift need that shift in focus. Some are recovering from surgery, while others are battling cancer, the coloring brings welcome relief from those struggles. Bryan is happy to know that whatever hopes and dreams these kids put down on that paper, he and his team got to be a small part of it.", "Apple under investigation for alleged tax fraud. \"The Apple investigation is under way,\" the judicial source said on Wednesday, without giving details. The Italian subsidiary of Apple was not immediately available for comment. The maker of the IPhone is the latest prominent corporation to become the target of a tax probe in Italy amid a global crackdown on tax cheating by multinationals. In Italy, where tax authorities have become more aggressive in their dealings with global companies, fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were handed in June a 20-month suspended prison sentence and a heavy fine for hiding hundreds of millions of euros in unpaid taxes. Both deny any wrongdoing.", "The science world is freaking out over this 25-year-old's answer to antibiotic resistance. The new approach has so far only been tested in the lab and on mice, but it could offer a potential solution to antibiotic resistance, which is now getting so bad that the United Nations recently declared it a \"fundamental threat\" to global health. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria already kill around 700,000 people each year, but a recent study suggests that number could rise to around 10 million by 2050. In addition to common hospital superbug, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), scientists are now also concerned that gonorrhoea is about to become resistant to all remaining drugs. But Shu Lam, a 25-year-old PhD student at the University of Melbourne in Australia, has developed a star-shaped polymer that can kill six different superbug strains without antibiotics, simply by ripping apart their cell walls. \"We\u2019ve discovered that [the polymers] actually target the bacteria and kill it in multiple ways,\" Lam told Nicola Smith from The Telegraph. \"One method is by physically disrupting or breaking apart the cell wall of the bacteria. This creates a lot of stress on the bacteria and causes it to start killing itself.\" The research has been published in Nature Microbiology, and according to Smith, it's already being hailed by scientists in", "WATCH: Moment A Panther Leaps At A Man With No Glass To Protect Him.

It looks like it's all going to end in complete disaster but just as the big cat goes to pounce, the man spins around and starts laughing and playing with him like they're bezzie mates.

In comics past, the Eradicator was a former Kryptonian superweapon whose desire to preserve Kryptonian culture was so great, it genetically destabilised Kryptonian colonists who attempted to leave the planet in order to keep the race pure. The new Eradicator, however, is a little different. First introduced in the prior issue, this Eradicator has some similar trappings\u2014he wants to preserve Krypton\u2019s legacy, he has a quasi-antagonistic/protective relationship with Superman due to the fact that he\u2019s the last son of Krypton\u2014but he\u2019s much more interested in Superman\u2019s son.

Rowling's response in an interview back in 2000 gave the answer: about 1,000.  But when you look closer, that number doesn't make a lot of sense. Why are there so few students in Harry's class? This screencap shows Percy Weasley taking the first-year Gryffindors to their common room. In this scene, there are only about 18 students. Even in the books, Gryffindors in Harry's year besides Dean, Seamus, and the other usual suspects are rarely mentioned. That's almost half as many students as there should be, if Hogwarts has 1,000 students as Rowling said. There are seven years, and four houses. So theoretically, there should be about 35 Gryffindor students in Harry's year, almost double the 18 we see. So, why the lack of students? This Tumblr user has a very sad answer: TLDR: There are fewer kids in Harry's year and thereabouts because of the war with Voldemort. Which is a pretty sad thought. If that was the case, we should expect a bit of a baby boom in the years under Harry, as that tends to happen following major wars. Voldemort's reign occurred from about 1970 to 1981, so", "A video, a wheelchair and a suitcase: The mystery surrounding a Hong Kong tycoon's disappearance. But Xiao Jianhua, one of China\u2019s wealthiest and most politically connected financiers, whose disappearance last month sent a chill through Hong Kong and the political class in Beijing, does not appear to be fine. In the early hours of Jan. 27, he was taken out of the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong in a wheelchair, his head covered by a sheet or a blanket, according to people who have seen or been briefed on video footage captured by security cameras in the hotel. Mr. Xiao, 45, who was not known to use a wheelchair, was accompanied by about half a dozen unidentified men who were also pushing a large suitcase on rollers. He is believed to have been transported by boat from Hong Kong, eluding border controls, and is now in police custody in mainland China, according to two people familiar with the investigation into his whereabouts. While the reasons for his apparent abduction remain a mystery, it comes ahead of an important Communist Party leadership meeting this year that will fill top posts, leading to speculation that someone powerful may have wanted Mr. Xiao out of the way, or perhaps wanted to use him to silence rivals with whom", "@MileyCyrus is headed back to MTV. It was announced Thursday that the 20-year-old singer will perform at MTV's upcoming European Music Awards, airing on Nov. 10. Cyrus' inclusion in the show was publicized in a TV spot with LMFAO's Redfoo, which showed the party rocker smuggling the pop star in his suitcase to Amsterdam. Take a look at the teaser above. Cyrus made her last live appearance on the network during August's Video Music Awards, when she put on her headline-making performance of \"We Can't Stop\" and \"Blurred Lines\" with Robin Thicke. While Cyrus' performance earned MTV major publicity, not all of the coverage was positive. The network came under fire from the Parents Television Council, which issued the following statement about the VMAs, \"This much is absolutely clear: MTV marketed adults-only material to children while falsely manipulating the content rating to make parents think the content was safe for their children.\" Cyrus, who released her latest album, \"Bangerz,\" on Oct. 8, will be joined by Katy Perry and The Killers, who are also booked to perform at the awards show.

The best thing about summer movie season is also the worst thing about summer movie season: there's just so much to look forward to, that odds are we probably won't have time to see everything we want. Which is why even on our lengthy to-do list, we've reserved a section for films we'll drop everything to see, no matter what.  Today's picks aren't linked by genre or tone.

Back-to-School Supplies \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates back to school supplies expensive Not surprisingly, August is a big month for back-to-school shopping. Sales on school supplies are easy to find, but the prices might not be as low compared to other months. Since retailers know consumers are looking for sales on school supplies during August, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to stock up on lots of shiny new things that are more expensive than your traditional supplies. Shelves will be stocked with inexpensive \"loss leaders,\" like pencils and paper to get you in the door. But retailers count on you to also purchase full-priced items with high profit margins \u2014 like binders, graph paper and computer memory sticks, according to Time.com. It\u2019s an exciting time for kids, and it\u2019s easy to get tempted into buying all the new things. Consider keeping a stock of basic and inexpensive school supplies, like paper, pens, pencils and binders to get you through the first few weeks of school. Wait to buy the rest of your school supplies in September, which is typically the best month to score rock-bottom prices on this stuff. 3.

The data (or lack thereof) makes it all the more noteworthy when a case of voter fraud is discovered. A story emerged late this week about a Texas woman who was sentenced to eight years in prison, thanks to some confusion on her part on whether she was allowed to vote or not. Rosa Maria Ortega, 37, is a permanent resident of the United States who the New York Times reports was brought to America as an infant. The Times relayed a piece of her family history, and shared how she first gained the ability to vote:  Ms. Ortega, a native of Monterrey, Mexico, came to Texas with her mother when she was an infant. More than a decade later, the family was scattered after the mother was arrested and deported. Two brothers born in Dallas automatically gained citizenship; Ms. Ortega became a permanent resident and gained a green card, her brother Tony Ortega, 35, said in an interview. As a Dallas County resident, she registered to vote and later cast ballots in elections in 2012 and 2014, her lawyer, [Clark] Birdsall, said. While that was illegal, there was no attempt to break the law, he maintained: Some government forms", "How your doctor is turning into an airline. I'll leave it to the experts to figure out if this is born of physician greed or physician frustration, but there is no doubt that an increasing number of doctors are jumping on board the concierge medicine train. Michael Tetreault, editor in chief of Concierge Medicine Today, a trade journal covering the industry, said that there are about 12,000 physicians in the U.S. who now run concierge medical practices -- offices that charge annual fees, generally in the $1,200 to $2,500 range, for providing \"enhanced\" care. The total is up from just 4,000 physicians doing it in 2007, according to Tetreault. Some of them still work in-network for insurance companies, and others won't take insurance at all -- leaving it to their patients to file claims and wait for reimbursement. And then there are those docs who don't have concierge-designated offices per se, and who nobody is counting, who have begun to charge extra fees for services that were previously part of the care they provided. Here are a few examples of what is going on: Fees for talking to you outside the office.

The game, which is expected to feature VR elements haven\u2019t been confirmed by Rockstar yet. In the last couple of months, several sources suggested that GTA VI has been facing numerous delays. This rumor that GTA VI will be a Project Scorpio exclusive is highly unlikely as Microsoft will have to pay millions for this highly popular game to be exclusive to its console only. On the other hand, the pool of players with a PlayStation console is larger than that of Xbox, which could easily make Rockstar think against the idea.

One famous \"Law & Order\" exit that left fans both surprised and confused was the firing of Assistant District Attorney Serena Southerlyn. However, her dismissal by D.A.

Let\u2019s find out... 1. Margarine Regular margarine is commonly based on hydrogenated oils high in omega-6 fatty acids, which when unbalanced by omega-3 fats, lead to inflammation in the body and thus accumulation of fat, particularly in the belly. Hydrogenated oil generates unhealthy trans fats, which persist in these products even if labeled \"transfat-free,\" due to allowances made for manufacturers.

Requesting a burger without one ingredient means staff will have to make it freshly, rather than handing you one that's been sitting under the heat lamp, while the same trick works if you ask for unsalted fries. Requesting a receipt will make employees think you're a secret shopper, so they'll serve you the freshest food - and quickly too. And you can save money by ordering a cheap coffee and asking for a free refill of a more expensive hot drink, ordering the Happy Meal even if you're an adult and ordering a McDouble with Mac Sauce and lettuce to turn it into a Big Mac.  Former staff also advised ordering a 'round egg' in your McDonald's breakfast if the item you're asking for usually contains a scrambled egg patty.

My eyesight has never been good. I've worn glasses most of my life and as I get older that's a situation that I've only expected to get worse. When the Trust Me, I'm A Doctor team suggested that I try taking supplements to improve my eyesight, though, I was sceptical, particularly as I am not a fan of supplements. Nonetheless I headed off to meet Prof John Barbur of City University in London to have my eyesight thoroughly tested. He was particularly interested in my retina, the light sensitive part of the eye, and made me stare at a computer screen in the dark for hours, having tests flashed up at me which thoroughly and precisely measured the limitations of my perception of different colours, my night vision and my detection of faint and small objects. He also measured the level of protection that the most delicate area of my retina - the macula - had against damage from high energy blue and UV light. This protection is, in effect, a kind of natural sunscreen that we have covering the light-detecting cells, and is made up of yellowish \"macular pigments\".

For the United States, the bill comes to $634 billion owed to developing nations. The U.S. also would need to cut carbon emissions 55 percent to 65 percent, according to the Stockholm Environment Institute, Friends of the Earth, and Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement for Debt and Development. Worldwide, developed nations would have to pay more than $1.1 trillion annually to developing nations on top of massive emission reductions to keep climate change in check. The environmental groups created an online tool showing how much each country should cut emissions and how much money should be given to developing countries not fully responsible for global warming but that would be devastated by climate change nonetheless. That even includes nations such as China, now the world\u2019s largest carbon emitter. How did the environmental groups come up with such exact figures? The first scientific attempt to calculate each country\u2019s \"fair share\" factored in historical emissions, its wealth, and its current population. That means poor, populous, undeveloped countries would be the beneficiaries of funds from rich, developed nations to cut their emissions and help produce access to energy for the 2 billion people living largely off the grid. \"We call this a part of", "World's 'most colourful 5k run'.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies stayed the top movie in North America over the Christmas holiday weekend, its second weekend in release. Director Peter Jackson's finale to his second Tolkien trilogy ended the weekend in first place with an estimated $41.4 million. It's so far grossed $168.5 million domestically and $573.6 million worldwide. The Angelina Jolie-directed World War II biopic Unbroken opened in second place with an estimated $31.7 million and $47.3 million since its Christmas Day debut. Disney's adaptation of the Broadway musical Into The Woods bowed in third place with $31 million and $46.1 million since opening Christmas Day. Both Into the Woods and Unbroken performed beyond industry expectations. It was less stellar news for the weekend's other two major releases. The Mark Wahlberg drama The Gambler made an estimated $9.3 million for a seventh place debut and a total of $14.3 million since opening Christmas. Director Tim Burton's artist biopic Big Eyes opened meekly in 15th place with roughly $3 million and a $4.4 million haul to date, making it Burton's lowest-grossing opening weekend in years. In limited release, American Sniper debuted on four screens for a weekend haul of $610,000, while Selma opened on", "How to beat online procrastination:. This post originally appeared on Inside Higher Ed. The key to making online students focus on their coursework may be making procrastination as unenjoyable as possible, according to a study out of Cornell University. It\u2019s a familiar problem to anyone with a deadline and a computer: The assignment is open on the screen, half-finished, but is quickly lost in a stack of Web browser tabs. Upon rediscovery (with an accompanying pang of guilt), the procrastinator resolves to buckle down and type out the last few paragraphs\u2014right after clearing the notification that just popped up and checking just one more website. Richard W. Patterson, a Ph.D. student in policy analysis and management at Cornell, wanted to see if software could reduce procrastination and, as a result, improve students\u2019 grades. \"People frequently fail to follow through on the plans they make: They fail to meet deadlines at work, finish assignments for school, go to the gym, and deposit money in their savings accounts,\" Patterson writes in the report, titled \"Can Behavioral Tools Improve Online Student Outcomes? Experimental Evidence From a Massive Open Online Course,\" published by the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute. In higher education, Patterson writes, that failure to follow through can", "You Won\u2019t Believe What Hillary Ordered the DNC to do to Bernie\u2019s Brother! You Won\u2019t Believe What Hillary Ordered the DNC to do to Bernie\u2019s Brother! It all went down after the DNC, when Larry Sanders stopped the whole show to cast his vote for his brother, and reports are Hillary was FURIOUS. Or, no... that\u2019s some bullshit. What did you think the payoff for this clickbait headline would be? That Hillary ordered him kicked out of the party? You\u2019ve likely seen a lot of headlines like this in the past year. You may well have clicked on many of them. Today I\u2019d like to talk to you about how bullshit managed to infect this primary, and continues to consume our politics. The art of a headline like this is simple: I took someone beloved (Larry Sanders, who spoke so movingly at the DNC on behalf of his brother) and I combined it with a large dose of schadenfreude \u2014 the pleasure we take in other peoples\u2019 suffering. Or in this case, maybe the better word is cynicism: the pleasure we take in believing the worst about people.

Microsoft Edge sounds like some type of datacenter or corporate IT package from a decade ago. It\u2019s not cool, exciting, or even remotely interesting. It\u2019s boring and sounds like the dreadful EDGE pre-3G internet connection that nobody wants on their phones these days. My friends joke that their iPhones are on the \"edge of death\" when they see the little E icon, and Microsoft Edge just reminds me of a bad internet connection or a WWE wrestler. Neither of those are cool. A safe and bad bet Since Microsoft has picked Edge, you would expect a cool new logo and splashy brand, but that hasn\u2019t happened. Microsoft\u2019s Edge logo simply clings to the past by acting as a safe bet and mimicking the Internet Explorer logo. They\u2019re both a lowercase \"e,\" and all that\u2019s really removed from the Edge logo is the halo from the IE logo. It's designed this way for those who are familiar with the IE logo as it exists today, the generation that are still using the browser. Microsoft should be more concerned with the masses that have moved to download Chrome or Firefox, which both have completely different names and logos. What this all really highlights", "Do You Know What The Apple Logo Actually Looks Like? Adam Blake and his colleagues asked the students to first draw the logo from memory (you can see some of their attempts above). Then they had to choose from a selection of altered logos like the ones in the quiz you just took.

When it comes to dating, how often do we wish we could jump inside someone else\u2019s head? When it comes to figuring out what our potential lover is attracted to, it can feel like we\u2019re jumping through proverbial hoops. A recent study suggests that there is one thing men are not attracted to, and frankly, it\u2019s pretty damn frustrating. A recent study from the Warsaw School of Economics, located in Poland, suggests that men are intimidated by clever women. Yeah, that\u2019s right: Study findings suggest that after a woman reaches a certain level of \"clever\" or \"smart\" behavior, there is no longer a positive correlation on how attractive her potential partner finds her. To gather this data, researchers had 500 people participate in speed-dating activities where they rated the physical attractiveness and intelligence of the people they were meeting. Every few minutes, they\u2019d be matched with a new \"date\" and then asked if they would want to meet that person again. Sadly, there is a clear spot in the data where men stop valuing women\u2019s intelligence. Basically, this science suggests that men want smart and clever women, but only up until a point.

Throughout the campaign, amid news stories of Islamic terror attacks overseas and at home, Trump took a skeptical line towards Islam, noting how often the ideology has been tied to murderous attacks.

Working as a secret shoplifter for large retail chain. I would basically test loss prevention and see what I could get out of a store. The total would be tallied up and taken off the store managers bonus. So they had to be on their game. One thing I used to do was steal copper electrical cable sold by the foot. I would drag it to the fence and spool it up in my car parked on the other side. This was fun to me and an obvious catch for the store. I go outside to the wire rack and there is the store manager getting a blow job from a cashier. They spotted me and quickly went back inside to leave me alone. I then went ahead and spooled out the wire as planned. Not one but the entire inventory to the point my car started to get lower under the weight.

A new feature on Delta Air Lines\u2019 app allows passengers to track the whereabouts of their checked luggage on a map in real time. Delta says it\u2019s the first airline to offer a bag-tracking map. The map captures data from new radio-frequency identification bag tags Delta rolled out earlier this year, which are secured to bags passengers check on domestic flights. The tags include a tiny chip, similar to the ones that are embedded into pets, that emit a signal that is then picked up by a scanner. Delta, which handles about 120 million bags a year, said the project cost $50 million. The chances an airline will lose your bag are quite slim. US airlines reported an average of three mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers in August, according to the Department of Transportation. Where the new bag tags come into play is by helping airlines quickly locate lost bags and get them to their correct destination. The US government wants airlines to refund checked bag fees if passengers\u2019 luggage arrives late\u2014fees they don\u2019t want to return.

For the most part, the Control Center \u2014 that little settings menu you swipe up from the bottom of your display \u2014 is a good thing. Introduced with iOS 7, it\u2019s made it very easy to access commonly used functions. Three or four button presses become a swipe and a tap. This is something any OS that sells itself on \"simplicity\" should strive to do. The problem is one that\u2019s not unfamiliar to iPhone owners: a lack of user control. As it stands now, the functions you can access are limited to the handful Apple chooses itself. For me, it\u2019s not a stretch to call some of these expendable.

The film was shot on location in Alaska, Hawaii and Tonga over 3 1/2 years. \"We've been working on trying to get this film done for 10 years,\" director Greg MacGillivray told The Huffington Post. His son Shaun, who produced the film, explained that a partnership with Pacific Life finally helped make the film happen. Shaun said that they had to be in the right spot at the right time, like any other wildlife film, but shooting such large creatures underwater was even more challenging. \"It was tough, but we ended up getting fantastic shots,\" he said. The film is about celebrating these remarkable animals, said Fred Sharpe, a scientist who's featured in the film, and \"their unusual cooperative behaviors and social prowess.\" The filmmakers were able to capture footage of humpbacks' bubble-netting behavior, during which they work together to create a net of bubbles and trap schools fish.

When, during a TV interview, the children of Donald Trump were asked who his favourite was, they all agreed it was Ivanka. Why? Because she is beautiful!

I quote Trump literally: \"I made her myself and she has a beautiful body\". There is more, where this comes from! Trump about Ivanka: \"If I were not her father, and if I were not happily married, I would probably date her\". Now, here is your answer! Women are worthy and they are useful, if they have a body, Trump regards as being beautiful. If they are sexy. If they look like fashion models. But if she has average looks from Trump\u2019s point of view, Trump is not interested in her! Not even if she is a Prime Minister or a Professor! Not even, if she is his own daughter! Who cares?

And if you haven\u2019t experienced the magic of this show, here are a few reasons why you should. And yes, I know that the show will change drastically next season, but this is just another reason to appreciate the good old original Bake Off. 1. Because, in many ways, it\u2019s the most wholesome reality tv show you\u2019ll ever see. 2. For real, everyone is lovely.

(Perhaps Gabriela can phone up Candice Swanepoel, wearer of the $10 million Victoria's Secret Fantasy Bra, for some tips?) Before she gets into that swimsuit, Gabriela did a few turns in a long-sleeve evening gown, a silver creation with dotted and striped details that reminded us quite a bit of Jennifer Lopez's stripey Zuhair Murad dress from the 2012 Oscars.

Oh, how times have changed. Now a handful of companies own vast swaths of web activity \u2013 Facebook for social networking, Google for searching, eBay for auctions \u2013 and quite literally own the data their users have provided and generated. This gives these companies unprecedented power over us, and gives them such a competitive advantage that it\u2019s pretty silly to think you\u2019re going to start up a business that\u2019s going to beat them at their own game. The fact that Facebook already has the data in 1.7 billion users\u2019 profiles and, more important, the history of its users\u2019 interactions means that you\u2019re probably not going to attract a lot of savvy investors.

As you level-up, however, you can gain access to additional Incubators that can be used to hatch multiple eggs at one time. At various level intervals you'll gain access to 3x Incubators. These Incubators can only be used three times to hatch eggs, but according to Eurogamer you'll be able to get a total of 13 free Incubators by simply leveling up.

It is no secret that certain psychological illnesses, like depression for example, have physical symptoms. According to the NHS, sufferers of clinical depression may exhibit changes in appetite and weight, unexplained aches and pains, disturbed sleep or, if you are a woman, changes to your menstrual cycle. Multiple studies have investigated the extent to which your nervous system, which influences emotions, can predispose you to physical illnesses. Dr Esther Sternberg, whose seminal work The Balance Within seeks to reconcile the central nervous system and the immune system, identifies a link \u2013 though not a causal one \u2013 between emotional state and inflammatory diseases: The same parts of the brain that control the stress response ... plays an important role in susceptibility and resistance to inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. And since it is these parts of the brain that also play a role in depression, we can begin to understand why it is that many patients with inflammatory diseases may also experience depression at different times in their lives. Sternberg argues that, while feelings do not cause or cure disease, the biological makeup of both are similar enough as to affect the other.

Never drink undiluted household bleach. Mark Gallagher, Wikipedia Commons There are all kinds of rumors about ways you can beat a drug test. Obviously the easiest way to pass the test is to avoid taking drugs in the first place, but that\u2019s not going to be much help if you\u2019ve already taken something and are facing a test. According to Snopes, some people drink bleach believing it will somehow clear their system of drugs. While it is unclear where this idea originated, the rumor is out there. Will it work? Will drinking bleach hurt you or kill you? Here\u2019s the lowdown: Drinking Bleach to Pass a Drug Test Household bleach consists of about 5.25% sodium hypochlorite in water. Specifically, Clorox says their bleach contains water, sodium hypochlorite, sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and sodium polyacrylate. They also make scented products that include fragrances. Bleach also contains small amounts of impurities, which aren\u2019t a big deal when you\u2019re using the product for disinfection or cleaning, but could prove toxic if ingested. None of these ingredients binds to drugs or their metabolites or inactivates them such that you would test negative on a drug test. What Happens If You Drink Bleach?

In an incident in 1986, dubbed the Ealing Vicarage Rape, three men broke into Saward\u2019s family home, drunk and high on drugs, while Saward, who was 21 at the time, was watching television with her boyfriend, David Kerr. Her father, vicar Michael Saward answered the door and was threatened with a kitchen knife. Two of the men repeatedly raped Jill at knifepoint and brutally attacked her boyfriend and father. But just under a year later, the judge caused outrage when he said Jill\u2019s trauma \"had not been so great\", and gave one of the men more years for the burglary than the rape. Jill suffered flashbacks and nightmares for three-and-a-half years following the attack, and came close to suicide three times. Her identity was kept anonymous throughout the criminal trial, but she made the decision to write a memoir and speak publicly about what happened to her. Jill went on to valiantly work as a case worker for a council\u2019s domestic violence forum, and as a lobbyist for the rights of and support for rape victims. She campaigned to dispel the stigma surrounding rape to help victims not feel shame. She also bravely spoke out about forgiving her attackers.

He will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the American League. But it's not just about how many balls he has hit over the fence -- it's how far he has hit them. Judge is challenging the current champ, Giancarlo Stanton, as the king of the XXXL home run. Judge\u2019s 460-foot homer on Saturday in Pittsburgh was the third longest for a Yankee since ESPN started tracking distances in 2009. Only Alex Rodriguez's 477-foot homer in August 2015 and Juan Miranda's 469-foot shot in October 2009 traveled farther. In the past two seasons, Judge has three of the four longest Yankee homers. Only Chase Headley, with a 453-footer in July 2016, cracks the top four.

In addition to his life-threatening greyscale, actor Iain Glen is now playing a media mogul, a\u0300 la Richard Branson, on a new show called \"Cleverman.\" So now we're really worried. Does Glen's participation in \"Cleverman\" hint at Jorah's fate? \"I don't think you can draw that conclusion,\" Glen reassured The Huffington Post when addressing our concerns. (Thank the old gods and the new!) The actor explained that, although it appears \"Game of Thrones\" has a long production process, it's really only shot for half of the year with two units working in tandem. Contrary to popular belief, Glen says new projects are not a good indicator of whether or not a character doesn't make it on the HBO series. \"They've always been amenable to actors doing other work around it.

Economic participation and opportunity, which includes female labor force participation, wage equality and the percentage of women in high-ranking, highly-skilled jobs. 2. Educational attainment, which looks at female literacy, and women's access to and enrollment in both basic and higher education. 3. Political empowerment, which examines the number of women holding political office as well as the number of female heads of state over the last 50 years. 4. Health and survival, which is measured by comparing female and male life expectancy and mortality rates.

Last week, the San Francisco suburb made active a smoking ban that officials say is the strictest in the country, prohibiting smoking cigarettes in your own home. The ordinance specifically bans smoking in dwellings that share a wall with another unit, including apartments, duplexes and condominiums. The hope is to eliminate second-hand smoke from creeping through doors and windows, ventilation systems, floorboards and other susceptible openings. According to a U.S. Surgeon General report, secondhand smoke kills about 50,000 Americans per year, including 430 infants. The San Rafael City Council unanimously approved the ban last year. \"I'm not aware of any ordinance that's stronger,\" said Rebecca Woodbury, an analyst at the City Manager\u2019s office, to ABC. \"It doesn't matter if it's owner-occupied or renter-occupied. We didn't want to discriminate. The distinguishing feature is the shared wall.\" While California outlawed smoking in bars, clubs and restaurants in 1995, the San Rafael ban is the first to move the restrictions inside the home -- a move that the American Lung Association called \"groundbreaking.\" \"This legislation will improve the health of all Californians by reducing exposure to smoke that drifts into housing units from balconies, patios, and other units,\" said the association's president and CEO,", "This Father Dressed His Daughter For Day Care, And Missed A Few Important Things.

While this research provides important clues, it\u2019s not conclusive. In general, there\u2019s a lack of direct evidence about specific foods that are good for sleep. In addition, the range of varieties of cultivars of most foods means that their nutrient profile can be inconsistent.

It is now extremely common to drive by tanning salons, since it is such a service that is used by so many people. For Jude Thrasher, she was one of these regular customers until it changed her life completely as she lost an entire part of her face. Jude had been using tanning beds since she was 13 years old, and continued using them three times a week for eleven years. She would do twenty-minute sessions when she went to the salons instead of using the one her parents has at home. This in itself was definitely excessive for her, but by the time of her wedding, she had upped it to going to six to seven times a week, still doing her twenty-minute sessions. At this point, Jude, aged 26, knew that her skin was taking damage as it was slowly wrinkling. Even more striking was the strange sore on her nose that she was developing. \"The sore had burst open overnight,\" said Judy Thrasher, \"I just thought I must have scratched myself in my sleep.\" Then just one month later it came close to healing but burst again.

Key Facts At least 39 people have been killed in attacks with machetes, guns and bombs since February 2013. The killings, mostly with machete blows to the back of the victim\u2019s neck, have been accelerating lately, with five people murdered in April, four in May and at least three so far in June. On Sunday, a Christian grocer and the wife of a police superintendent who had been cracking down on militant attacks were killed in separate strikes. On Tuesday, a Hindu priest was killed in southwestern Bangladesh. In a lengthy interview, the chief of the police counterterrorism unit, Monirul Islam, who assumed his post in February, laid out the findings of his investigation in minute detail. The killings were organized by two militant Islamic groups that have gathered volunteers and recruits, trained them and eventually seeded them into cells run by a commander, Mr. Islam said. They have tried to pick their targets with care, with the aim of gaining support from the public, he said, and trained teams of killers. Their goal was to convert Bangladesh\u2019s mixed secular and religious culture to an Islamist one, the chief investigator said. The Bangladeshi authorities say that they now believe they have", "You Won\u2019t BELIEVE What Strange Thing Was On Stand-By At Hillary\u2019s Rally! What gave me pause here was InfoWars. But Paul Watson is a good writer and a fairly reliable source there unlike some of the others. He says they had a reporter in Cleveland who saw the ambulance and a gurney being wheeled out. The EMS workers were in bullet proof vests. You can see it for yourself in the video below. The only rational explanation here is that it was a precaution for Hillary Clinton. We know she has something wrong with her and she won\u2019t release her medical records. Anyone with eyes in their head can see she is not well. From InfoWars: EMS workers wearing bullet proof vests who had been traveling in an ambulance that was part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s motorcade in Cleveland, Ohio earlier this week were caught on camera wheeling out a hospital bed, prompting more questions as to the state of Hillary\u2019s health. Hillary suffered a four minute coughing fit during the event which prompted national headlines and an attempt by the Clinton campaign to pressure the media into not reporting on future episodes of Hillary\u2019s ill health.

And before you ask, no\u2014we aren\u2019t pitching you the beginning of a delightfully morose Icelandic folk tale. Instead, we are here to recount the unfortunate story of one Japanese soba restaurant owner, whose heartbreaking tale is 113 years in the making. Maruka, a soba restaurant in Uchi-Kanda, located in Tokyo\u2019s Chiyoda Ward, has been in business since 1903. But last week, @Ki_46ozzie tweeted a photo of a poster that now hangs outside the shuttered restaurant. The poster explains why the restaurant can no longer remain open: The owner has a debilitating allergy to buckwheat, the main ingredient in soba. The tweet has since been retweeted more than 14,000 times. The poster says that the owner\u2019s allergy has been worsening of late. Although the closing is described as \"temporary,\" the poster seems to suggest something more definitive: \"To all our customers who have provided us with their patronage over the years since 1903 in the Kanda area, a long period of time which spans 113 years, we would like to express our deep gratitude from", "Google Pixel/Nexus 2016 Release Date. Reports have been pumping the internet that Google will introduce a couple of new smartphones under a new title, the upcoming smartphones of Google will be called Pixel (was named as Nexus Sailfish) and Pixel XL (formerly called Nexus Marlin), which means that the Nexus branding is going down the drain.

TMZ caught up with the 32-year-old at LAX following news that the hotel heiress is pursuing legal action against a Slovenian porn site that's illegally profiting off her name and sex tape, \"One Night In Paris.\" With her X-rated tape back in the news, TMZ wanted to confirm Hilton's claims that she never profited from it. \"[I] never made a dollar,\" Paris told the cameraman, adding that she never tried to get a cut of the profits either. \"I make enough money in nice ways. My fragrance makes enough, I don't need to worry about that.\" It's a claim Hilton has been making for years, telling British GQ in 2006, \"I never received a dime from it. It's just dirty money and he should give it all to some charity for the sexually abused or something. To be honest, I don't even think about it anymore.\" While Hilton may not have profited directly from the sales of \"One Night In Paris,\" the tape boosted her profile enormously, turning her into a household name.

But, alas, last summer's annoyingly long transfer saga started up again this week with rumours that the recent Champions League winners were set to renew their interest in the Spanish stopper. De Gea to the Bernabeu is a transfer rumour that seems destined to live in the gossip pages for eternity but the 25-year-old has given the most definitive statement yet on his intention to remain a Manchester United player as De Gea slammed the media for discussing the move without any genuine knowledge of what's going on. \"People talk a lot and they know little,\" De Gea said in quotes appearing in Marca. \"I know how all this works, but what I think is disrespectful is when people start making out that it's something I have said. \"I've got three more years on my contract with United and the desire to win more titles here.\" De Gea carried on to express his excitement with the arrival of Mourinho and believes that the former Chelsea boss brings with him a winner's mentality, something that is badly required around Old Trafford if United are to start challenging for Premier League titles again. \"Talk about Jose Mourinho and you're talking about a winner,\"", "Michael Jackson Fans Think He's Alive and They've Got Proof. 9 days ago 7.7K Shares Has everybody got their tinfoil hats on?

He was having a particularly rough day at work, and he admits that he was busy feeling sorry for himself, but that\u2019s when he looked out of the window of his truck. Right in that moment of self-pity, he saw a 60-year-old woman sitting alone in her car reading a book.

Booze-guzzling pig shows-up stunned drinkers by chugging THREE bottles of beer in seconds. The footage starts with the pig, seemingly outside a bar, skilfully picking up an empty bottle before dropping it to the floor when it realises there is no beer left inside. One of the onlookers then hands the hog a full of bottle of beer which it gratefully downs in seconds. When the pig finishes the beverage it again drops the bottle to the ground and looks for another. The animal then finds another full bottle that was being rested on the ground by a drinker and promptly chugs its contents down as the onlookers erupt with laughter. After seeing no bottles available in the immediate area the pig waits until one of the men watching the hilarious scene unfold hand it the dregs of his beer, which its downs in a matter of seconds once again. Not content with its alcohol fix the pig then picks up one of the bottles it had finished moments earlier, ensuring it had consumed all the beer it could have.

That said, getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society. Often times, it's a requirement by the criminal justice system, or else freshly-released inmates will risk being sent back to the feds. But even when ex-cons do manage to get hired, the work is underpaid, demoralizing, and their employers don't do much to encourage the re-entry process. There are organizers that help former prisoners assimilate into the workforce, but the support is generally few and far between. After serving 23 years in the feds, the first job I got on the outside was as a saute\u0301 cook at an Italian restaurant, despite my earning two college degrees while in prison. The work sucked, and I was forced to do the grunt work no one else would do, like clean out the fryers every night. I wasn't in any position to argue and risk being canned, and my employers took advantage of this. I dreaded that job, but as I've talked with other ex-cons over the years about their first gigs on the outside, I now consider myself lucky.

The other day, New York Times polling analyst Nate Cohn laid down a useful marker for gauging whether the conditions are taking shape for Hillary Clinton to crush Donald Trump in a landslide. Cohn noted that the GOP nominee is viewed as fundamentally unfit for the job by an unusually large percentage of Republican voters, perhaps creating unique complications in the quest to unify them. \"Many Republican voters have an unfavorable impression of him \u2014 worse still, many don\u2019t even think he has the knowledge, temperament or qualifications to be president,\" Cohn wrote. \"If Mr. Trump can\u2019t reunify Republican-leaning voters, Mrs. Clinton really could win in a landslide.\" Speaking in Warren, Mich., on Aug. 11, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton outlined her vision for the U.S. economy. (The Washington Post) Today brings new polling that suggests these conditions may indeed may taking shape. The new NBC News/Survey Monkey Tracking Poll finds Clinton leading Trump among registered voters nationally by 50-41.

More than a quarter of a million patients were forced to change their doctor\u2019s surgery last year as the closure of GP practices hit record levels, data suggests. Some 265,000 patients had to change their practice, a 150 per cent increase on 2014 figures and a 15 per cent increase on 2015, according to data collected by Pulse magazine under the Freedom of Information Act. The figures, most of which were provided by NHS England, showed that 57 practices closed completely last year. A further 34 closed due to the merger of practices. Some areas were particularly hit, with Brighton seeing seven practices close in the past two years, Pulse said. Four of these closures meant 9,000 patients had to find a new surgery. Last year, NHS England announced a \u00a3500m \"turnaround package\" to help struggling surgeries, including those at risk of closure.

By most accounts, dead touchscreens have become an iPhone 6 Plus epidemic, and yet the company has not commented on it, leaving consumers uninformed and harming independent repair businesses. In many cases, Apple has charged hundreds of dollars to replace a broken phone with a refurbished one that is subject to the same engineering defect that caused the phone to break in the first place. \"Touch Disease\" On the logic board of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, there are two tiny chips called \"Touch IC\" chips that translate your finger presses into machine-readable information. The thing is, these chips are located in a part of the iPhone 6 Plus that is particularly susceptible to bending and flexing, which is a known issue of the phone. The phone flexes ever-so-slightly thousands of times over the course of normal usage: as you pull it into and out of your pocket, or sit on it, or drop it. Eventually, all those-micro flexes add up, and the solder that holds the chips to the logic board comes loose, leading to a condition that the repair industry is calling \"touch disease.\" There are many different severities of touch disease, but its most common tell", "#Shocking School van driver raped children in his car.

During the \"Right To Rise: Education as America\u2019s 21st Century Ticket to Social Mobility\" event, Brooks recalled recent visits to \"off the map\" areas neglected by politicians because they're home to voters who are either certain they'll vote for them or certain they won't. After speaking with people in the areas -- \"prostitutes, drug addicts, ex-felons, homeless people\" -- Brooks said they called for three things. \"Transformation, relief and opportunity, in that order,\" he said. The top conservative considered the partisan discourse surrounding support for those who need it, saying the far left calls for endless amounts of relief, while the far right calls for enterprise. \"One of the things, in my view, that we get wrong in the free enterprise movement is this war against the social safety net, which is just insane,\" Brooks said. Brooks' comments came weeks before an automatic decrease to food stamp benefits set for Nov. 1, in which the average family will see a $36 cut in their benefits. \"The government social safety net for the truly indigent is one of the greatest achievements of our society,\" said Brooks. \"And we somehow want to zero out food stamps or something, it\u2019s nuts to want to", "What if Apple Made iPhones in the US?

But neither candidate has discussed how such a change would affect the price of the expensive smartphones. crunched the numbers to find out. The author, Konstantin Kakaes, evaluated two scenarios to come up with an answer. A new analysis published last week in the MIT Technology Review crunched the numbers to find out. The author, Konstantin Kakaes, evaluated two scenarios to come up with an answer. Under the first scenario, Apple would continue to source the parts for its iPhones globally but would assemble them in U.S. factories. That would add about $30 to $40 to the price of an iPhone 6s Plus, which sells for $749, bringing the total cost to $779 to $789. Under the alternative scenario, Apple would both make the components and assemble them in the U.S., which would add an additional $30 to $40 to the price of a phone, bringing the total to $809 to $849. The author points out that it would be virtually impossible to manufacture an iPhone without sourcing some raw materials globally. Many of the materials used to make a phone aren\u2019t mined in the", "The three biggest mistakes Hillary Clinton is making right now. Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton has been on a bit of a losing streak lately. She did pull out a technical victory in the Kentucky primary on Tuesday, but she lost the Oregon contest and simply cannot shake Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders . To make matters worse, her national poll numbers against Donald Trump are also starting to sag. Two of those polls now show Mrs. Clinton behind Trump, and one poll shows her unfavorable ratings soaring to an all-time high. So, what's Hillary doing wrong? The answer is: a lot of things. But let's narrow it down to the three biggest dumb things she and her campaign continue to do. Is there a coffee table book called \"Platitudes for Every Occasion?\" If so, Hillary definitely owns it. Worse, she seems to have been consulting it as her primary political guidebook since 1999. It's sad that a woman who based her earlier career thinking boldly about policies and taking ideological risks has been positively boring, cautious, and predictable ever since she first became a candidate for the Senate. Even on a new media platform like Twitter, Clinton's statements are still as rigid as an old-style direct mail pamphlet. Really? I guess", "Read What Donald Did To His Wedding Caterer, It Will Make You Sick. An actor friend of mine worked for a caterer in 1993.

Everything went beautifully \u2014 the food was a hit, the waiters/waitresses all were totally professional. Everything was first rate. Donald Trump refused to pay the bill. He told the caterer, \"I know you are new at this, and when you tell people you catered MY wedding, you will get more business than you could ever dream of. So I am doing you a favor. And when I do favors, I don\u2019t pay. End of discussion.\" She couldn\u2019t believe it \u2014 she sent numerous bills \u2014 ignored. She threatened to sue \u2014 he said \"Go ahead.

On Saturday, the \"Firework\" singer took some time from her busy schedule to answer questions from fans on Twitter. When someone asked if she would ever work with Swift, Perry responded with a short and simple answer. \"If she says sorry, sure,\" she said. Twitter The feud between Perry and Swift goes all the way back to 2014, when the latter told Rolling Stone about an unnamed fellow female pop star who \"tried to sabotage an entire arena tour.\" It\u2019s this female pop star that \"Bad Blood\" was written about. \"She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me,\" Swift said. \"And I\u2019m surprisingly non-confrontational \u2013 you would not believe how much I hate conflict.

More than 90 percent of new parents at one Oregon Hospital made at least one key error in installing their newborn's car seat or in positioning the newborn in the seat, according to new research to be presented Monday at the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference. \"As someone who has been doing this for a number of years, I've always been struck by how difficult it can be for parents to adequately protect their children,\" study researcher Dr. Benjamin Hoffman, a professor of pediatrics at Doernbecher Children\u2019s Hospital at Oregon Health & Science University and a certified car passenger safety technician, told The Huffington Post. To conduct the study, Hoffman and his team observed 267 sets of babies and caregivers who were discharged from Doernbecher's mother-baby unit between fall 2013 and spring 2014. (For the purposes of the study, the caregiver was either the newborn's parent or an adult designated by the parent.) As the families prepared to leave, safety technicians watched them install the car seat in their vehicle and place the baby in the seat, in order to screen for what the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has deemed \"critical misuses.\" On average, researchers found 4.2 misuses per", "This is one of the biggest skills new graduates lack.

For the second time in less than a week, Jane McQueeny, a KU administrator in charge of sexual assault investigations at the university, spoke to students Tuesday afternoon about how the school handles reports of rape on campus. Just a few days earlier, McQueeny joined KU Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little and other officials at a Sept. 18 panel to answer questions from students on the same topic. Student activism on campus and online over how the university handles sexual violence has put continued pressure on the administration, and helped to prompt Gray-Little to announce on Sept. 11 that the university would create a task force of students, faculty and staff to review policies around sexual misconduct on campus. \"Every member of the KU community has an obligation to help shape the climate in which we work and study,\" Gray-Little said in an email outlining the task force and panel. \"I look forward to us all working together as we make sure that KU is a safe place for every member of our community.

The Belgian's poor form was one of Chelsea's biggest problems last season as they stumbled to a lacklustre 10th-placed finish. Fast forward a few months and the 25-year-old is helping them challenge for the title again. Something clearly went badly wrong under Jose Mourinho. Hazard picked up a little after Christmas once the Special One had been fired, but he still never looked close to the player that won PFA Player of the Year two years ago. Under Conte, though he's now scored three goals in as many games, compared to the four he managed in the whole of last season. It goes without saying that the new manager's arrival has done him the world of good, but the humble Italian believes there's a bit more to it than that. When asked about the reasons for Hazard's revival, Conte told reporters, via Goal.com: \"I think that Eden is playing now more close to the goal. \"He's participating more in offensive situations. I think it's better for him, this type of situation, which sees him staying in a position where he can finish easier compared to in the past.

Exactly 100 years later, at the 2012 Olympics in London, Oregon-native Ashton Eaton became the latest in a long line of American Olympians to win the gold medal in the decathlon. He had previously set the world record in the event at the US Olympic trials, but as with every decathlete since Thorpe\u2019s win in 1912, it was winning the Olympic gold that earned Eaton the formidable title of the world\u2019s greatest athlete.

The ITV drama \u2014 which was insanely popular in Britain when the first season was broadcast back in 2013 \u2014 has just gotten stuck into its third season. At the time of writing, we're three episodes in. Every time a new season of Broadchurch starts, I become achingly obsessed with it. The characters are great, the acting is flawless, and there's always a messy central mystery that keeps you guessing until the very last minute. If you're already watching it, great. If you've yet to give it a try or you've never even heard of it, let me try and convince you why it's worth a go. As you've probably gathered from that Season 1 trailer, it's not exactly a laugh a minute. But it is addictive viewing. The first season revolved around the murder of an 11-year-old boy in a small, seaside town in Britain, and the resulting investigation. The second season was half courtroom drama, half new mystery. The third is about a rape. I don't want to say too much more in terms of plot, because I don't want to give anything away \u2014 but it's safe to say that there isn't any one central character (pretty much", "These Bizarre Objects Are Washing Up On Beaches Everywhere, And You Won\u2019t Believe What They Are.

A noodle is nothing without a sauce to cling to (when\u2019s the last time you sat down to a plate of plain pasta?), which is why it\u2019s important to leverage the pasta\u2019s natural starchiness, so the pasta and the sauce can work together. You don\u2019t need to agonize over the sauce itself, but rather how it's going to adhere to the pasta. Let\u2019s start at the beginning. After dropping the dry noodles into a pot of boiling water, you may be tempted to add a tablespoon of olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking. But adding oil will only make the noodles slippery, and prevent them from mixing nicely with the sauce later on. Instead, when you drop the pasta in the water, use a set of tongs (or a spoon) to separate the noodles inside the pot\u2014then stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it from clumping as it cooks. When you\u2019re ready to drain the pasta, reserve some of the cooking liquid to thicken a tomato sauce, loosen a pesto, or help ricotta adhere to the noodles.

Brower boasted of cleaning up the city by taking a sledgehammer to homeless people's shopping carts. (He apparently wears gloves and an Armani Exchange baseball cap while doing such dirty work.) If shopping carts bore a store name, he would return the carts to the store. His self-proclaimed \"tough-guy\" approach went further. He yelled and roused sleeping homeless people at city bus stops. \"If someone is sleeping at night on the bus stop, I don't do anything,\" he told the Star-Advertiser. \"But if they are sleeping during the day, I'll walk up and say, 'Get your ass moving.'\" Despite the extreme tactics, many Hawaii residents identified with Brower's frustration.

This modified crunch targets the sides of your abdominals better, the same place that those handles sit. 2. Side plank dips This is a variant of the plank that will make your core burn like crazy. Put your arm at a 90-degree angle (alternate between left and right side). Dip your hip 10-12 times on one side and then switch. 3. Standard Plank Again, keep your arms at a 90-degree angle, with your legs and back completely straight. Hold this position for 30 seconds at a time, with rest periods in between. 4. Stability Ball Plank Again, very similar to the standard plank, the stability ball plank involves raising your legs up behind you. By combining the plank moves above, you will target all of the necessary abdominal muscles needed to burn love handles. 5. Cut 100 Calories At A Time, Here And There.

They're often leaving seven days or more on the table, especially in regions like the South and the Midwest. Is America's culture of \"workaholism\" to blame? Partly, the survey shows. The good news is that the top reason workers claimed they did not use all of their vacation days in 2016 was because they were saving them to use in 2017. About a third of respondents said that they plan on taking advantage of the fact that their company lets them roll over unused days. (Though, who knows? They may have said that last year too.) The other reasons given confirm that many U.S. workers feel bound to their jobs. About a quarter of workers say they simply work too much and can't afford to take time off, while just over 15 percent say they actively enjoy working and prefer it to vacation. It's good to remember that more time on the job doesn't necessarily translate to better performance at the job. \"Without taking time to recharge, employees can find themselves stressed, overworked and sick \u2014 all of which have a direct impact on", "33 Things That Have Happened In The Harry Potter Universe Since The Series Ended. 1/33.

Adele and her boyfriend, Simon Konecki, recently celebrated their fifth anniversary together while the singer was performing at tour stops in Nashville, Tennessee, over the weekend. Instead of letting that little hiccup interfere with their love, Konecki did the cutest thing to surprise Adele, with whom he shares a son, Angelo. At the end of the singer\u2019s shows, white confetti with Adele\u2019s handwritten lyrics usually falls from the sky down onto welcoming, weeping fans. \ud83c\udf41\ud83c\udfa4\ud83d\udc99Photo by Rachel #Adele @Adele in that Blue Jays jersey!

The body-camera war has also included skirmishes in New York City, where Vievu's win of a $6.4 million body camera contract sparked similar accusations about the quality of its products and a fierce lobbying campaign by Taser. Last month, amid questions over the contract, the tussle led Mayor Bill de Blasio to complain of a \"smear\" campaign against Vievu. In a statement to Fast Company in response to Taser's new lawsuits, John Collins, a Vievu spokesman, said the company \"believes in its cameras and technology, and looks forward to a full discovery process in which the public can see Taser's underhanded tactics in full view.\" Taser, the market leader, has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that its cameras are simply superior to its rivals. And as it develops its software and cloud storage ecosystem for video, the company is also determined to be known as an innovator. As CEO and cofounder Rick Smith explained to me, the technology vision is much bigger than hardware: The coming generation of cameras will be bolstered by live-streaming, object and face recognition, and artificial intelligence.

HBO Finally, after teasing the confrontation all season, last night\u2019s episode of Game of Thrones saw Jon Snow face off against the vile Ramsay Bolton. The two Northerners battled in the courtyard of Winterfell, after the largest and most brutal battle in Thrones history, and Jon ended up beating the bastard into a bloody pulp. It was a wonderfully cathartic moment to see the usually cocky and sneering Ramsay get his just desserts but it was anything but wonderful for poor Iwan Rheon. HBO Kit Harington admitted during filming he may have got a bit too in character accidentally hitting Iwan not once but twice while miming his punches, according to the Evening Standard He said: I actually did punch Iwan in the face, twice, by accident, which he took really well. He was really nice about it. I had to buy him a pint after that one. Thankfully Iwan doesn\u2019t share his characters love of skinning men alive and laughed off the accident joking: \"Jaw hurt a bit the next day, but, you know, it\u2019s understandable.\" Harington also revealed that he thinks Jon goes a bit too far while beating Ramsay\u2019s face into a fine paste.

The average American family pays over $11,000 just in the first year of a child's life, and nearly $250,000 by the time they're 18. And while most of the incurred expenses prove worthwhile, not every toy, class, or experience warrants its price tag. So how can you decipher when it's worth it to splurge? Business Insider asked parents with children of all ages to weigh in on the financial side of having kids.  Not every parent went into their reasoning, but every family is different, and it makes sense that every expense would be valued differently, too. Below, we've anonymously included 16 things they say are totally worth the cash: \"A good babysitter [or] a regular part-time nanny for both working and stay-at-home parents is so worth the investment in your time and sanity.

It\u2019s heartbreaking to see animals in situations that they can\u2019t get out of. Such was the case with this Orca whale who became stranded on rocks. The tide turned off the coast of British Columbia and a pod of orcas who were likely seal hunting, lost one of their own as it became stranded, ending up on rocks. Whale watchers caught wind as to what had happened and thankfully came to the rescue. You can hear the poor guy practically crying for help. The crew acted fast as they knew they had to. Wet blankets and sea water to keep the whale cool was used and the video really is incredible as to what they did next to help this animal in distress.", "Groupon couldn't handle how insanely popular this deal was. The weeklong bargain began Sept. 5, and offers 1 kilogram of onions at 9 rupees (about $0.14) for 3,000 buyers each day. The signature whimsical Groupon ad reads thus: People haven\u2019t experienced onions in a long, long time. That sweet, pungent aroma of onions being saute\u0301ed to a nice golden brown before being added to your mum\u2019s signature curry is no longer familiar. This much-coveted, much-written-about, much-craved-for vegetable is now almost as expensive as caviar, diamonds and Donald Trump\u2019s wig! Men are scrambling to the market to pick the perfect onion ring to please their ladies. Groupon had no idea how right that ad was. It took only 44 minutes to sell the first 3,000 kilograms of onions, and the sudden traffic spike subsequently crashed Groupon's Indian site, according to Al Jazeera America. Groupon India didn't anticipate that the discounted kitchen staple would turn into its most popular sales offer. The site's Chief Executive Ankur Warikoo said the deal was meant as a fun promotion. \"It was meant to generate excitement by selling onions at a knock-down price.

SciShow has revealed that the mysterious eye gunk is actually a build up of mucus, bacteria, dust, dirt, and dead skin cells - that collect in the corner of your eyes when you sleep. Niiiice. Basically, when we're awake (and blinking lots) each blink wipes away the build up of mucus, bacteria and dust - keeping eyes fresh. But when we sleep, our blinking stops, meaning the build up of gunk in our eyes often collects in the corners and ta-daaa: an eye booger is born. People who suffer from allergies or sensitive eyes often have more gloopy and wet eye gunk, as they rub their eyes more and produce more mucus, where as dry eyes produce more of a crumbly, crusty clump - but everyone gets a bit, and it's totally normal.

In 2006, three years after it launched, MySpace became the most visited site in the US by some metrics, and it became known as a launching pad for musicians after artists like Calvin Harris, the Arctic Monkeys, and Lilly Allen got IRL famous after attracting attention on the social network. In 2005, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought MySpace for a then-eye-watering $580 million. Everyone knows what happened next: Users migrated to Facebook en masse, MySpace's aesthetic became regarded as ugly and cluttered. In 2011, Murdoch unloaded the site for $35 million, describing his decision to buy (and then hang onto) MySpace as a \"huge mistake.\" By then, the site was a punchline as well as a lesson in how quickly a site could become irrelevant. But today it embodies another aspect of online business culture: eternal optimism. The people currently in charge of the site imagine that with a little luck it could return to its current glory, even if no one else thinks so. \"We were trying to be everything to everybody, and we just stopped innovating,\" Linh Chung, who", "This Lake Holds Something Far More Dangerous Than Jaws. This may sound like a scary movie plot, but for the thousands affected, it was a very real nightmare. A hydrovolcanic eruption 400 years earlier created a crater in the lake, where massive amounts of carbon dioxide built up over the centuries. Volcanic rumblings continued miles below the surface, with gas seeping into the groundwater to create \"CO 2 -charged soda springs\" that bled into the lake, says Dr. George Kling, a biologist at the University of Michigan. When that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke. The problem with CO 2 is that it builds up, \"like in a soda bottle,\" Kling says. No one can see the pressure building as long as the cap \u2014 in this case, the weight of the water \u2014 stays put and forces the gas to dissolve or be submerged. But when that cap is removed, it explodes like a warm, shaken Coke, with bubbles rising to the surface and a giant burst of CO 2 escaping into the atmosphere. Triggering the pressure\u2019s release can be as simple as heavy rain or an earthquake.

This article is adapted from the book \"But What If We're Wrong?\" to be published in June by Blue Rider Press. And pretty much from the moment it came into being, people who liked rock insisted it was dying. The critic Richard Meltzer supposedly claimed that rock was already dead in 1968. And he was wrong to the same degree that he was right. Meltzer\u2019s wrongness is obvious and does not require explanation, unless you honestly think \"Purple Rain\" is awful. But his rightness is more complicated: Rock is dead, in the sense that its \"aliveness\" is a subjective assertion based on whatever criteria the listener happens to care about. This is why the essential significance of rock remains a plausible thing to debate, as does the relative value of major figures within that system (the Doors, R.E.M., Radiohead). It still projects the illusion of a universe containing multitudes. But it won\u2019t seem that way in 300 years. The symbolic value of rock is conflict-based: It emerged as a byproduct of the post-World War II invention of the teenager, soundtracking a 25-year period when the gap between generations was utterly real and uncommonly vast. That dissonance gave rock music a distinctive,", "This Is How Long Smartphone Batteries Should Last. That time saw mixed 3G mobile data usage and Wi-Fi, high and low brightness, Bluetooth on, all Google apps syncing, with no battery or power saving profiles active. I browsed the web, used social networks, took a few photos, watched Netflix and YouTube, and listened to music. Nothing out of the ordinary: this is just how the phone works. The Xiaomi Mi Max has a 4850mAh non-removable battery and a 6.4\" 1080p LCD display, which should make it clear just how such battery life is achievable. A lower resolution, an efficient chipset (Snapdragon 652), and a ginormous lithium-ion pack - plus Android 6.0's doze mode for idle time - are a recipe for longevity. While it is understandable that a 1080p display may no longer be fashionable on a $700+ high-end smartphone today, what remains deeply mystifying to me is how most manufacturers seem to compromise on the size of batteries when battery life remains a massive pain point for most people, especially as their phones age. The fact that we may have access to chargers throughout the day or own external battery packs isn't an excuse: the entire reason we do these things is because smartphone batteries don't last long", "Wow, Instagram has a lot of followers.

Kaplan was an editor at the Observer for 15 years. During his time there its distinctive salmon-colored pages gained a reputation as an authoritative source on the activities and the foibles of New York's notables. More importantly, the paper became a breeding ground for journalistic talent, and Kaplan pioneered a sharp, sardonic tone that would go on to influence the entire architecture of the media world. As the New Republic put it in a 2012 profile: \"It\u2019s hard to find a major publication right now, in print or online, that\u2019s not in some way flavored by the old Observer...subtract Kaplan from the media landscape of the past 20 years and you lose The Awl, much of Gawker and a good bit of Politico, too.\" Kaplan's career was wide ranging. He left the Observer in 2009, and was most recently the editorial director of the Fairchild Fashion Group. Besides his brothers James and Robert, Kaplan is survived by his second wife Lisa Chase and their son, as well as three children from a previous marriage to Audrey Walker.

Thanks to the curious mind of Robbie Gonzalez from io9 , the latter of those questions might be answered. After finding no sturdy answer on internet forums, he decided to track down a copy of a maintenance manual for the Boeing 737 on Wikileaks and contact Marlowe Moncur, Director of Technology for GKN Aerospace, the world leader in passenger cabin window design development. As you might have already guessed, it\u2019s to do with regulating pressure. He found that most cabin windows consist of outer, middle and inner panes \u2013 all of which are made of a superstrong synthetic resin. Typically, it\u2019s the middle pane that has the mysterious little hole. Only the outer and middle panes are actually structural, while the inner is pretty much there as failsafe and to protect the other layers. Moncur said it\u2019s only there to maintain cabin pressure in the extremely rare event that the outer pane becomes fractured. Cruising at 10,600 meters (35,000 feet), the pressure is around 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) per square inch. This is too low for the human body to stay conscious, so the pressure is artificially maintained at around 3.5 kilograms (8 pounds) per square inch.

In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don\u2019t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion.

Employees across 20 countries will take part in Yuanqing's wealth with 85 percent of payout recipients working in China. The average payout per worker of $325 is nearly equivalent to a month\u2019s pay for an employee in China. A company spokesperson told Bloomberg that a majority of the workers who will receive part of the bonus will be hourly employees who are not eligible for other bonus programs.

It\u2019s a nasty image but one that\u2019s meant to strike fear into the Bolton\u2019s enemies; the house was infamous for the centuries-old practice, and because Ramsay had taken over Winterfell, the sigil was prominently displayed in the show\u2019s opening credits. But as of Sunday\u2019s finale, the Stark sigil was back in its rightful place. It was a subtle change but a big moment for the show because of how important \"Battle of the Bastards\" was. Fans were understandably pumped about the change; all seems right in the Game of Thrones universe\u2014at least for now. Also notable is that it reflects Jon\u2019s newfound status as King in the North. Because Jon is thought to be a bastard, custom dictates the colors of the sigil be reversed. Instead of", "The weight loss 'secret' that no one is telling you. Drug research has not yielded a pill that helps people lose weight and keep it off. Traditional approaches such as diet and exercise can work short-term, but people almost inevitably regain the weight. Randomized controlled trials of weight loss surgery have shown some improvements in diabetes but not in mortality, cancer and cardiovascular disease. If there is ever to be a \"pill\" \u2013 a solution to weight \u2013 it will be changing the brain, particularly the primitive areas of the brain, the \"emotional brain\" or mammalian and reptilian brain. These areas house circuits that control stress and our stress-fueled emotions, thoughts and behaviors. These circuits can be rewired in humans so by changing them, we have a chance to address the root cause of stress-related problems, including obesity. While some overweight and obesity are caused by genetic make-up, more and more research is indicating that stress plays a big role in weight gain. Many people under stress turn to food for comfort. My colleagues and I set out to develop a neuroscience-based approach to weight management and dealing with the common excesses we all face, through emotional brain training. The idea was to use neuroscience-based tools to change the brain so", "Peter Dinklage's voice-over work on this video game is pretty unbearable. Dinklage voices the artificial intelligence unit Ghost, which follows the player\u2019s character throughout the game, offering advice, commentary and history of the environment. Unfortunately, many fans are less than thrilled with the results of the \"Game of Thrones\" actor\u2019s voice work. \"He sounds like an actor unsure of his character, without a director to indicate who he\u2019s supposed to be,\" writes a reviewer from Kotaku. \"Every time he begins talking I\u2019m pulled out of the game and reminded that, oh yeah, the guy who plays Tyrion Lannister isn\u2019t particularly interested in convincing me to give a s**t about what\u2019s happening around me.\" To be fair, Dinklage\u2019s work has been seen only in the game's \"alpha\" version, for early adopters. In response to the negative reception, Bungie, the studio behind \"Destiny,\" and formerly \"Halo,\" has confirmed that the dialogue has been updated and will be fixed by the game\u2019s Sept. 9 release. On its blog, the developer told fans not to worry. \"Funny thing about Alpha builds...they\u2019re not done. Please pardon our Moon dust!\" Bungie wrote. According to Re/code Bungie has even offered fans a limited edition T-Shirt sporting one of Dinklage\u2019s most poorly delivered lines: \"The Wizard came from the moon!\"", "The saddest/happiest show on TV is...

Brewers, including many in Upstate New York, have either stopped making pumpkin beers or are cutting back production. It's a big change: Pumpkin (or pumpkin-spice) beer was one of the biggest trends in craft beer in the past five years. The change dates back, in part, to the nationwide overproduction of pumpkin beers that reach a peak last fall. Pumpkin beers sat on shelves, and in some cases brewers had to buy it back from their distributors. It was the \"Great Pumpkin Debacle of 2015,\" said Gregg Stacy, director of sales and marketing for Ithaca Beer Co. Ithaca this year discontinued the fall seasonal beer, Country Pumpkin, which it had introduced in 2011. Overproduction is just part of the problem, Stacy said. Ithaca is moving away from seasonals in any case, and is looking for different beers to add to its portfolio. This year, it launched Hellish Lager, a more traditional light-colored German-style beer (such traditional beers may be the \"new\" trend in craft beer). Hellish Lager is \"the anti-pumpkin ale,\" Stacy said, noting that the pumpkin ale was never a big", "What State Has the Worst Drivers. It's logical to think that states with notoriously bad traffic would produce some of the nation's rudest commuters, and while states like New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia fall in the top 10, the state with the absolute rudest drivers is tucked away in the Rocky Mountains: Idaho. (MORE: 10 Cities With the Worst Drivers) The survey concluded that Idaho is made up of two main types of drivers -- \"those who are moving so slowly that they're judged to be rude, and the aggressive drivers who speed around them and flip them off.\" The imperfect marriage of these two driving types propels the Gem State to the top of the list. One responder took a stab at explaining the strange dichotomy happening in the Northwest. Eric Leins of Southern California posited that Idaho's rural and mountainous terrain was to blame. He argued that residents and seasoned drivers are familiar with the twists and turns and lack the patience for those who are navigating the state's roads for the first time. Another survey responder said that he thinks everyone in that state is just content to take their time on the roads and don't seem to have the", "Big move for next Marvel blockbuster. No other news about the project accompanied the date change, but the Disney missive continued to fuel speculation that \"Star Wars: Episode VII\" might not arrive in theaters during the summer of 2015. With \"Ant-Man\" now on the calendar, Disney has four films, \"The Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" \"Pirates of the Caribbean 5\" and Pixar's \"Inside Out,\" all set for release between May and July of that year. The studio is also set to release J.J. Abrams' \"Episode VII\" in 2015, and while summer was mentioned by the studio as a landing spot, no firm date has been set. (A recent report suggested that December of 2015 might be a more viable option than the traditional May \"Star Wars\" release date.)

Burying the golden orbs in a mixture of salt and sugar for a handful of days dries them out and concentrates their flavor, just like bacon or lox. The result is something semi-firm, salty, and savory. Think: eggy aged cheese, with an eye-poppingly pretty orange color. Cured egg yolks are delicious\u2014but strong. Because they're super salty, they're better used as condiment than as the main event. For an umami boost, try grating them just like cheese over pasta, salads, avocado toast, popcorn, or even scrambled eggs. Currently, cured yolks aren't even available in the most upscale grocery stores, so you'll have to make your own. Even better if you're raising chickens at home and have your own fresh eggs on hand.  Fortunately, the process couldn't be easier. Here's how: 1. Start by combining 1 cup salt and 1 cup sugar in a bowl. Mix well to combine. Place half the mixture in a small baking dish. 2. Separate 4 egg yolks, saving the whites for another use. Carefully place each egg yolk on top of the salt-sugar mixture, and gently sprinkle the yolks with the rest of the salt-sugar mixture.

First, wave \"hello\" So you were driving down the road a little faster than you should have been, and you spot a police cruiser lurking behind some shrubbery. One former police officer says that the smartest thing that you can do right then is to wave at the officer. Why? He will either think that you know each other and wave back, or will think that you\u2019re acknowledging that you were driving too fast, and are letting him know that you\u2019re slowing down. Either way, you drastically reduce your chance of getting a ticket. Don\u2019t say: \"I\u2019m sorry I was speeding\" If you do get pulled over, says one former police officer, never acknowledge that you were, in fact, speeding. You don\u2019t want to give the police any ammunition to use against you, should you contest your ticket in traffic court. When the officer tells you that you are speeding, giving a brief, noncommittal response like, \"I see\" or \"I thought I was going with the flow of traffic\" is the way to go.

Cleopatra lived closer in time to the invention of Snapchat than to the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Cleopatra died a little more than 2,000 years ago in 30 BCE, while the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed around 2560 BCE. That\u2019s a difference of more than 2,500 years. 2. Also, the Great Pyramid was older to the Romans than the Romans are to us. Even in its earlier years, the Roman Empire was still further removed from the construction of the Great Pyramid than they are from us. 3. Oh, and the Stegosaurus was older to the Tyrannosaurus rex than the T. rex is to us. Not only did they not exist at the same time, but the T. rex (which lived 85 to 65 million years ago) became a species about 74 million years after the Stegosaurus died out. 4.

He'd been looking for an internship since Christmas, only to find his emails unreturned or re\u0301sume\u0301 shoved into piles. \"Honestly my story to find a summer internship is fairly familiar with lots of other college students.

But fans can take a deep breath now because Atkinson is very much alive and is just clearly a victim of an elaborate Internet hoax. The said article that got everyone in a tizzy showed Atkinson\u2019s photo with his birth date as well as the supposed deceased date. As the photo had the logo of BBC News, many mistook it for a credible source and started sharing it all over Facebook. According to the article, Atkinson supposedly took his life. Moreover, the article shared that Atkinson had been battling severe depression, drug problems as well as alcohol abuse. Image source: The Sun The same online publication also claimed that the actor has been in rehab since last year September. According to the website, all these news were shared to them by Atkinson\u2019s publicist. According to The Sun, the \"Rowan Atkinson dead\u2019 rumors are not true at all. The rumor was believed to have been copied from the previous Internet hoax about Adam Sandler. That being said, Atkinson is alive and is currently with his wife and two children. This was not the first time Atkinson has been a subject of death hoaxes on the Internet. In 2012, a Twitter post stated", "Who's got a carrier to rival the U.S. Navy's? (Hint: Not Russia). An aircraft carrier can be a very handy tool, especially when trouble flares up far from a friendly military base. Just ask the Pentagon, which has 10 big Nimitz-class supercarriers that it uses around the world to protect air and sea lanes and to mount airstrikes. There\u2019s generally at least one of them stationed near the Middle East at all times. So, as other countries join in military action against extremists in the world\u2019s hot spots, can\u2019t they send their own carriers into action? Well, they could if they had any. But, aside from the 10 American giants, there\u2019s currently only one big carrier in the whole world that can handle such a job \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t belong to Britain, Russia or even China. Though it is nuclear-powered, the Charles de Gaulle isn\u2019t quite a supercarrier \u2014 it\u2019s shorter and much lighter, and doesn\u2019t pack the same punch. But neither does it rate down among the small escort carriers and helicopter carriers that a number of navies employ.

The problem there is that Social Security is only designed to replace 40% of the average American's pre-retirement income. Most of us will need anywhere from 70% to 80% of our pre-retirement income once we retire, and some of us might need even more -- especially those with medical conditions requiring costly care.

Six states are considering bills that would put an end to laws restricting dog ownership by breed.

And most Americans think they're bad laws. Bad laws! Opposition to BSL comes from sources as diverse as the American Bar Association, animal rescue groups, the Center for Disease Control and even President Barack Obama, who said in August that the laws are largely ineffective while doing nothing to improve public safety, and are often a \"waste of public resources.\" In addition, a recent poll conducted on behalf of the rescue group Best Friends Animal Society found that a big majority in the United States don't want the government deciding which breeds of dogs we may and may not keep as pets: A new national survey commissioned by Best Friends Animal Society reveals that 84 percent of those polled believe that local, state or federal governments should not infringe on a person\u2019s right to own whatever breed of dog they choose.

China's Tiangong-1 space station has been orbiting the planet for about 5 years now, but recently it was decommissioned and the Chinese astronauts returned to the surface. In a press conference last week, China announced that the space station would be falling back to earth at some point in late 2017. Normally, a decommissioned satellite or space station would be retired by forcing it to burn up in the atmosphere. This type of burn is controlled, and most satellite re-entries are scheduled to burn up over the ocean to avoid endangering people. However, it seems that China's space agency is not sure exactly when Tiangong-1 will re-enter the atmosphere, which implies that the station has been damaged somehow and China is no longer able to control it. This is important because it means Tiangong-1 won't be able to burn up in a controlled manner. All we know is it will burn up at some point in late 2017, but it is impossible to predict exactly when or where. This means that there is a chance debris from the falling spacecraft could strike a populated area. Fortunately, it's unlikely anyone will be injured.

Longo, a Florida native, thought that the little thing didn\u2019t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll. Indeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was \"half-dead\" when they first met. And so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in St. Petersburg. Consequently, Longo christened the critter Biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. Clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major TLC. However, without an inkling of even which species Biscuits belonged to, Longo didn\u2019t have the first idea about how best to raise her. So, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online. First, Longo went to Reddit to ask the website\u2019s online community for help. However, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he\u2019d manage to raise Biscuits on his own. Undeterred, though, Longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was", "Sandra Bullock googled herself and this is what happened. \"I thought maybe it would be a nice fun approach to this evening to do, maybe, something different, so I Googled myself and read the comments section, thinking I would get some tidbits of what people really think of me and share them \" she said at the 25th annual Palm Springs International Film Festival Gala on Saturday (Jan. 4). \"Never read the comments section ... or Google oneself, at anytime...\" \"Apparently, Julia [Roberts], I don't know where you are, you and I are in a dispute over George Clooney,\" Bullock laughed. \"We talked about this, right?

The thing about deithyl ether is that it\u2019s really, REALLY flammable. And it floats on water. So The Backyard Scientist set out to determine if said fire could lit in a swimming pool, and then be extinguished by liquid nitrogen. Because liquid nitrogen also floats on top of water it creates an oxygen barrier that puts out the raging flames. For a bonus experiment he also attempts the same feat but with dry ice instead of liquid nitrogen. Granted, he also briefly sets his hand of fire in the process.

It has long been thought that the feature is a re-working of a previous Crowe script, called \"Deep Tiki,\" about a military defense contractor navigating the waters between his relationships and a satellite launch. TheWrap's Jeff Sneider offered this updated log line when breaking the Murray news: The romantic comedy stars Bradley Cooper as a defense contractor who\u2019s assigned to oversee the launch of a weapons satellite from Hawaii, where he falls for an Air Force pilot (Emma Stone). With the help of mystical island forces, they team up to scuttle the launch. No word yet on the part Murray will play, but expect it to be a supporting role. Should the deal work out, Crowe's film would become an unofficial \"Zombieland\" reunion, as Stone and Murray shared one hilarious scene in that 2009 comedy. (\"I'm sorry, he just gets me.

The word was popularized by Heinrich Heine not long after, who moved the word\u2019s meaning away from active loathing and toward sentimental apathy.

By Avens O\u2019Brien In August, the state legislature of California passed a bill to approve imposing mandatory minimums in sexual assault cases. This bill came about after the surprisingly short six-month sentence of Brock Turner for three counts of felony sexual assault (he was let out after three months for good behavior). The bill is now awaiting California Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s signature to become law \u2013 but there has been a considerable amount of backlash from a group one would generally expect to see in favor of harsher penalties: feminists. A coalition of 25 feminist organizations have submitted a letter to Governor Brown, urging a veto. From their letter: As student survivors of gender violence and their allies, we respectfully request that you veto AB 2888, which would institute a mandatory minimum sentence for any defendant found guilty of sexually assaulting an unconscious or intoxicated person. We know firsthand that the consequences of rape are no less damaging for a victim who is unconscious than for a victim who is not.

You may have heard horror stories of people being poisoned by sprouting potatoes, but is there actually any truth to any of these tales? To answer this question, first we need to know a little bit about what a potato actually is in terms of its botanical structure. Many people think of potatoes as root vegetables because they grow underground like carrots, parsnips and other root crops. But in actual fact they are a type of \"modified stem\" known as a tuber. These are compacted, swollen stems which are produced underground and remain there when the \"parent plant\" (the old plant that produced this year\u2019s crop) has died down. This allows the plants to survive through the cold winter period because the tubers are deep below the soil surface where they are protected from frost. Mamziolzi/Shutterstock Most of us are aware that potatoes are high in carbohydrates. This is because they need enough stored food to survive the winter. Food in the form of sugars is created by photosynthesis \u2013 which you will remember from school biology classes is the process by which plants use energy from sunlight to produce glucose (or sugars) from carbon dioxide and water.

Can a woman get pregnant when she is already pregnant? In other words, can she have two foetuses in her uterus at different stages of development? The technical term for this is superfetation. In humans, it's possible, but it's very uncommon. Two thousand years ago, that great Greek thinker Aristotle wondered about this very topic, specifically as regards the hare. Aristotle noticed that when a hare gave birth, quite often the offspring in a single litter would fall into two distinct classes: there would be a bunch of full-sized robust baby hares, and another bunch of scrawny frail baby hares. It was, he thought, as though the mother hare had become pregnant and then \u2014 while pregnant \u2014 had conceived a second time. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the smaller, weedy offspring, Aristotle thought, apart from the fact that they had not spent enough time growing in their mother's uterus. And he was right. Normally in humans, there are three separate barriers to stop a female from getting pregnant again if she is already pregnant. The first barrier is the hormonal changes after conception that stop the ovaries from releasing another egg. Dr Karl explores the uncommon phenomenon of superfetation.", "You Won\u2019t Believe What Facebook Is Giving Away for Free Now. You know you shouldn\u2019t click on that article.

While the regulator refused to extend information on the suspension reasons, the sources have informed Hindustan Times that 45% of the pilots were suspended for failing the breathalyser test, 30% for runway violation, 20% for flight and duty time limitation and 4% for miscellaneous violation. The DGCA however refrained for disclosing the airlines' names saying that \"they will start hiding violations\".

Over the past decade, more than 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty, according to statistics released last week for World Ranger Day. Some deaths were caused by accidents or animals. Most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants. At the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks. The numbers add up: Between 2011 and 2015, rangers at South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers. While these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial. The issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in India\u2019s Kaziranga National Park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park. \"We\u2019re pretty horrified by the situation,\" said Sophie Grig, senior", "Are We Heading for Another Housing Crisis? Lenders were handing out mortgages seemingly to anyone who applied, and in many cases, borrowers weren't asked for documentation to prove income. Some institutions rolled out adjustable-rate mortgages that featured teaser rates and were marketed to consumers as loans that could be easily refinanced before the interest rate was scheduled to reset and send payments into the stratosphere. As buyers clamored for homes, prices surged. But then the economy slowed and the bottom fell out of the housing market. Homeowners were unable to make payments, and sagging values made refinancing or selling impossible. The market crashed in what is widely considered one of the worst recessions to hit the country. While the economy and home prices have both rebounded, some people have expressed concern we are headed for a repeat housing bubble. As of January 2016, home prices were rising at a rate twice that of inflation, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. What's more, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have unveiled programs to allow first-time homebuyers to make a purchase with only 3 percent down.

Fertilization takes place when an egg cell and a sperm cell recognize one another and fuse to form an embryo. But how they recognize each other in order to hook up had remained a mystery. Researchers said on Wednesday they have identified a protein on the egg cell's surface that interacts with another protein on the surface of a sperm cell, allowing the two cells to join. This protein, dubbed Juno in honor of the ancient Roman goddess of fertility and marriage, and its counterpart in sperm, named Izumo after a Japanese marriage shrine, are essential for reproduction in mammals including people, they said. This new understanding of the role of these two proteins could help improve the treatment of infertility and guide the development of new contraceptives, the researchers said. \"By identifying this interaction between Juno and Izumo, we now know the identity of the receptor proteins found on the surface of our father's sperm and our mother's egg that must interact at the moment at which we were conceived,\" said Gavin Wright of the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute in Britain, one of the researchers in the study published in the journal Nature.

She looked casual in a gray pullover jacket, black spandex and sneakers, while the former \"Dancing With the Stars\" pro opted for a pink button down and black jeans.

The tricky thing, for many of us, is getting the balance right and ensuring we maintain a healthy weight. However, the metabolism is not always an easy thing to understand and differs from person-to-person, varying in efficiency and requiring differing amounts of energy to process the foods and drinks consumed. Wouldn't it be fabulous to be able to eat foods that can help you lose weight, simply by eating them? Although this doesn't quite make sense on first reading, you may be surprised to know that there really are foods that can help you do just that. Research suggests that there are some foods that may help manage weight by boosting the metabolism, due to their thermogenic effect on the body - in other words, the amount of energy used and heat produced as your body processes this food. All foods, when consumed, speed up the action of the muscles in the digestive tract, using up energy and producing heat in the process. This is known as thermogenesis. However, certain foods use up more energy and create more heat as the body 'burns' calories. The harder the food is to digest, the more calories the body will have to burn to", "How a design for city living went wrong | Letters.

First, ask people how much they think the average employee steal from a cash register in a year. Dishonest people are likely to give a higher number, because we assume others are like ourselves. Then, ask them to draw the letter E on their foreheads. Self-centred people are more likely to draw the letter facing themselves if they're more self-centred.

C. botulinum has long been known to produce the highly dangerous toxins, giving scientists time to develop antitoxins with which to treat them. But H type, the first new botulinum protein discovered in more than 40 years, is untreatable. Fortunately, the likelihood of an average person randomly encountering the new toxin \"is exceedingly small,\" Hooper told The Huffington Post via email. Dr. David A.

The psychedelic TV spots where people would dance hyperactively with an MP3 player in their hand and headphones in their ears? After surveying a national group of 7,200 teens, analysts at the research arm of Piper Jaffray discovered that teens like listening to music the 2000-and-late way, through downloaded music onto iTunes libraries or MP3 players: That's 42 percent of teens listening to music through MP3s, according to the bank. But what does that statistic mean? Piper Jaffray told us that the \"42 percent\" figure was compiled from four survey questions, but it hasn't revealed how. Nor has it indicated what that percentage indicates\u2014whether it's 42 percent of teens preferring MP3s over other options, or if it's that, 42 percent of the time they listen to music, teens are using MP3s to do it. Even with the little information, it's enough to ask: Do teens actually listen to MP3s? Consider, first, the dubious finding that Pandora and other streaming methods together attracted only 31 percent of teens. (That category also includes Spotify and sites like Songza.)

Triclosan is a synthetic antimicrobial agent that can upset bacterial communities in the gut, a new study suggests. Use of triclosan can also lead to \u2018superbugs\u2019 which are bacteria that are fully resistant to antimicrobials (e.g. antibiotics). Triclosan was first introduced in the 1970s in hospital scrub soap and is now found in many consumer products, such as: toys, cosmetic products, deodorants, toothpastes, mouth washes, shampoos, detergents, bedding, kitchen utensils, cutting boards, trash bags, and surgical cleaning treatments. Triclosan is absorbed through the skin easily and traces can be found in most people\u2019s urine. Dr Thomas Sharpton, an author of this study said: \"There has been a legacy of concern about exposure to microbial pathogens, which has led to increased use of these antimicrobial products. However, there\u2019s now a growing awareness of the importance of the bacteria in our gut microbiome for human health, and the overuse of antibiotics that can lead to the rise of \u2018superbugs\u2019.

But it's a good thing he didn't, because inside was a wallet that had been stolen more than three years ago. \"I was pretty amazed to catch a wallet, last thing I expected,\" Woods told HuffPost, \"I was immediately stoked to try to find the owner.\" Woods posted a photo of his find on Facebook, and soon friends of friends were able to connect him with Jesse Gomez, the owner of the wallet.

While you could argue that young workers have always been inclined to job hop (and millennials are less inclined to do so), their reasons for restlessness may have changed. Young workers' latest gripe? Insufficient opportunities to develop their leadership skills. That's according to the fifth annual Global Millennials survey, cited on Bloomberg, for which Deloitte reached out to nearly 7,700 working college-educated professionals in 29 countries. As many as 63% of respondents said their leadership skills are not being fully developed. And it seems to be a key reason behind their willingness to leave: While 71% of those likely to leave in the next two years are dissatisfied with how their leadership skills are being developed, that number drops to 54% among those who are planning to stay beyond 2020. As Punit Renjen, chief executive officer of Deloitte Global, told Bloomberg, young workers' pursuit of leadership skills even at the expense of switching jobs is a new phenomenon. Perhaps it has something to do with the recent trend of flattening organizations, which was highlighted in The Washington Post. In an effort to cut costs, organizations have removed levels of bureaucracy, which means there's not much of a corporate ladder to climb", "Why We Should Abolish the Weekend. But we do need time off.

The celebrated naturalist recounted witnessing a riverside battle between a group of horses and electric eels while on a trip in the Amazon in 1800. There have been no recorded sightings of electric eels attacking anything on the shore since, so it had been assumed that von Humboldt had exaggerated which he had seen. But biologist Professor Kenneth Catania, from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, found that the eels will jump out of the water to attack larger predators which when they become partially submerged in the water. While using a net with a metal rim handle to move them, he noticed that after a while the eels stopped trying to dodge the net and began to rise out of the water to press their chins to the handle and \"generated a series of high-voltage pulses\". After noticing the phenomenon, he designed an experiment when he placed them in a tank with prosthetic human arms and alligator heads - covered with a conductive metal strip and LED lights to show the electricity generated - partially submerged in the water.

Researchers discovered less grey matter in the brains of men who regularly view pornography compared with those who don\u2019t. Experts say it\u2019s the first evidence for a link between watching sexually explicit material and reductions in brain size \u2013 but the new study doesn\u2019t prove that pornography causes changes to the brain.

Dr Simone Ku\u0308hn from the Max Planck Institution in Berlin led the study. \"Unfortunately we cannot answer this question based on the results of the present,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not clear, for example, whether watching porn leads to brain changes or whether people born with certain brain types watch more porn\".

I am well acquainted with the vast body of research that shows the physical and psychological harms of deprived environments. Orphanages can arguably be placed under this category along with other places such as refugee camps and some hospitals where children lack close contact and attention. Deprivation comes in many shapes and forms: lack of food, diseases, maltreatment, and child abuse are some of the harms that come to mind. However, I would argue that deprivation of love can be just as deadly. When I started researching orphanages and child health I read the classic works of paediatrician Harry Bakwin, psychologist John Bowlby and psychiatrist Harry Edelston. At the beginning of the 20th century, in the US and the UK, the death rates among infants placed in orphanages, nurseries, and foundling hospitals were, in some cases, close to 100%. London\u2019s Foundling Museum documents in depth these harsh realities. In the 1940s, the work of psychoanalyst Rene Spitz further documented high infant death rates (one out of three) and, among the babies who didn\u2019t die, high percentages of cognitive, behavioural and psychological disfunction.

One owner started a Reddit thread detailing his experience, with his phone losing 70 percent of its charge in just three hours. There\u2019s also a thread on the Oculus forums detailing similar issues. With a staff member present in the thread, Oculus is at least aware of the issue.

But there's another number that paints a particularly dire picture for the GOP's alternative \u2014 especially in light of President Trump's populist rhetoric. According to the CBO, 64-year olds making $26,500 per year would see their premiums increase by an estimated 750 percent by 2026. While they are on track to pay $1,700 under the current law, the CBO projects the American Health Care Act would force them to pay $14,600. Even if you grant that inflation will allow them to make slightly more money by 2026, that's still about half of their income going to health care. Here's how that looks as a percentage of income (h/t Philip Bump): As skeptics of the law noted, that suggests the reason premiums as a whole will eventually decline is because older, poorer people simply won't be able to afford it. The legislation reduces premiums substantially for younger people but increases them substantially for older people \u2014 and especially poorer, older people \u2014 according to the CBO. The CBO's estimate of the premium increases for older, poorer Americans is actually worse than a previous one from AARP.

When I first started teaching at UMass Lowell 3 years ago, I didn\u2019t know much about teaching. One thing I did know, though, was that my lectures were going to involve a lot of quizzing. I started off with two sections of Cognitive Psychology, which I taught in a fairly traditional lecture style, except that I always included a demonstration of an experiment in each lecture. I then faced a choice: should I put the quiz questions at the end of the lecture, or throughout? From what I knew of the literature, the choice wasn\u2019t obvious. On the one hand, most of the research on implementing quizzing in the classroom with positive results had focused on quizzes that were given after the lecture (1). Anecdotally, I also heard from colleagues in my field that this is what they did in their own classes. On the other hand, I had recently done a study on face-name learning where quizzes were interspersed throughout learning (2). The results of this research strongly suggest that interspersing quizzes throughout learning helps not only learning of the face-name pairs that are tested, but also the learning of NEW face-name pairs that come later in the same learning", "You'll never guess what this man had living in his EAR. But spiders crawling into your mouth should be the least of your worries when your far away and dreaming in slumberland. This young man had to have hundreds of tiny maggots removed from his ear after houseflies invaded and laid their tiny eggs while he was sleeping. Doctors in India said if they had not treated him, the wriggling larvae - which were feeding off his flesh - could have burrowed into his brain and killed him. The stomach-churning video was uploaded onto YouTube by Dr Vikram Yadav, who treated the unfortunate man. They can be seen squirming inside the man's head before Yadav painstakingly removes them with a pair of tweezers. An infestation of ear maggots is a common problem in the tropics and subtropics - going by the name of aural myasis. Sufferers usually complain of a buzzing in the ear and a smelly discharge - the fatality rate is 8% according to experts. It is usually seen in children younger than 10 years of age or in debilitated individuals. The best way to get rid of the infestation is to \"make them suffocate so they come to the surface\". As he picks the maggots out manually, Yadav says:", "A surprising reason hospital patients can\u2019t sleep. Researchers from the Cleveland Clinic found that the lack of fluctuation between low light and bright light -- like a typical sleep-wake cycle, where it's bright during the day and dark in the night -- in hospitals is linked with poor sleep, more fatigue and more pain among patients. For the study, published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, researchers examined the light exposure and sleeping patterns of 23 women and 17 men who were admitted to a hospital between May 2011 and April 2012. Researchers followed the light exposure, mood and pain levels of the patients for 72 hours each. Patients in general got fragmented sleep, and just 236.35 minutes (about four hours) of shuteye, on average, each night. An association was found between fatigue and bad mood and low light exposure, while pain levels were linked with fatigue. Meanwhile, \"higher light exposure was associated with less fatigue and lower total mood disturbance in participants with pain, suggesting the need for further investigation to determine if manipulating light exposure for medical inpatients would be beneficial in affecting sleep\u2013wake disturbances, mood and pain,\" the researchers wrote in the study.

A group of seven earth-size rocky planets, orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star, named the TRAPPIST-1 system is probably the most important space find of recent times. In May 2016, TRAPPIST had discovered three planets in the system. Later, the Spitzer telescope discovered that the third planet was, in fact, three different planets and it also found two more in addition. What makes TRAPPIST-1 special? The TRAPPIST-1 system is of particular interest to scientists because this is the first time that Earth-size planets have been found orbiting this kind of a star. Observations made so far have confirmed that these are rocky in nature, just like the inner planets of our solar system. The stars orbit is very near to their star, in fact all of them are closer to it than Mercury is to our very own sun. Interestingly, since the star is an ultra-cool dwarf, there\u2019s a good chance of liquid water existing on the surface of the planets, despite the close orbit. Even more important is the fact that three out of the seven are located in the habitable zone. This means three times the chances of alien life existing there. But does it?

Here's your for instance: In \"Kill Your Darlings,\" Radcliffe plays a young Allen Ginsberg, who, at the outset of the Beat generation, finds his friend, Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), embroiled in a scandalous relationship that leads to tragedy. When I pointed out that the Ginsberg, wasn't exactly a connoisseur of mainstream tastes, Radcliffe defended the \"Harry Potter\" franchise. The 24-year-old may be moving on from Hogwarts, but he certainly hasn't forgotten, nor dismissed, where he came from. Not only do you have \"Kill Your Darlings\" coming out this year, but you also starred in the Toronto International Film Festival debuts, \"Horns\" and \"The F Word.\" It's not easy to redefine yourself from Harry Potter, but it appears it's happening. I think it depends on the attitude you take towards it, basically. If you say, yes, \"Potter\" was the biggest thing that I'm ever going to do and I'm never going to come close to that again, and it's going to hold me back from getting parts, then probably all of those things will come true.

Constructed in the late 1930's, the complex still stands as one of the longest buildings in all of Europe. But of course, when this monstrosity of a resort was originally built it was intended to be the largest holiday resort in the world, capable of catering to 20,000 guests at any given time. The resort underwent construction in the late 1930's under the watchful eye of German politician Robert Ley. Robert envisioned an affordable holiday camp where even low-paid workers could escape and enjoy a seaside holiday. That dream never came to fruition, and instead a chilling history now haunts this place. At the time of construction, the Nazi Party held great power in Germany and as a result Albert Speer, Hitler's go-to architect, played a big role in the final outcome. Speer selected Clemens Klotz's design for the resort, which included 8 massive buildings just 500-feet from the shoreline.

Nail it to end it Men all over the world have united in a single cause \u2013 to help raise awareness about child abuse. By weekly painting one finger nail of their choice in any color they prefer, they are standing up for one in five children becoming victims to sexual abuse. The campaign quickly spread outside Australia where it initially started showing men everywhere displaying their willingness to make a change, and some great fashion sense too. The inspiration Aside from presenting one in five children falling victim to abuse, there is another meaningful symbolism behind painting a finger nail. It started when Elliot Costello went to Cambodia as a part of Hagar International project for helping poverty-stricken regions. There he met a girl named Thea whom he soon became friends with. During one of their conversations, as she was painting his nails, he learned that she was victim of sexual abuse on daily basis while living in an orphanage.

Fifty-eight percent of adults ages 18 to 24 consider rising student debt levels in the United States a \"major problem,\" according to survey results released exclusively to The Huffington Post on Tuesday by the Harvard University Institute of Politics. Only 3 percent said it's not an issue at all, while 22 percent called it a \"minor problem.\" Yet even among people who weren't enrolled in college, 54 percent still considered student debt a major issue. A plurality -- 39 percent -- blame colleges and universities for the rising amount of student debt, compared with just 10 percent who think students are at fault. Survey respondents were more likely to blame colleges for rising student debt if they were currently enrolled in school.

(Then again, Olive Garden has yet to hit Mediterranean shores.) Alfredo, after all, isn't found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes\u2014not because it isn't Roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. Its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the Trevi Fountain. In the early 1900s, the eponymous Alfredo di Lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife.

Despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate it on their Roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity.

A hacker took control of the baby monitor camera in Heather and Adam Schreck\u2019s daughter Emma\u2019s room one night and terrorized the family for a brief few minutes, per area news outlet Fox19. The mother said she heard what sounded like a man's voice coming from the baby's room during the night, and when she checked the camera feed from her baby\u2019s room, she noticed the camera moving on its own. \"About the time I saw it moving, I also heard a voice again start screaming at my daughter,\" she recalled. \"He was screaming, \u2018Wake up baby. Wake up baby.\u2019 Then just screaming at her, trying to wake her up.\" Once the couple realized how serious the situation was, Adam rushed into Emma\u2019s room. The camera promptly turned directly to him, and the mystery man on the other end started shouting expletives at him. When the father unplugged the camera, the scary invasion was over. Last year, a family in Texas experienced a similar intrusion when a stranger hacked their baby monitor and cursed at their 2-year-old daughter. Apparently it's relatively simple for hackers to access baby monitors that operate on a wireless Internet connection. But there are measures parents can", "Are Student Athletes More Likely to Commit Sexual Assault? An investigation found that Baylor University had mishandled sexual assault accusations against its football players. By Kate Wheeling Then-Baylor head coach Art Briles looks on from the sidelines. (Photo: Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) Last week, Kenneth W. Starr was stripped of his title as president of Baylor University after an independent investigation found that the university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against football players. Football head coach Art Briles was also fired as a result of the investigation. Starr, who will continue to serve as both chancellor and a law professor, gained notoriety as an independent counsel for his investigation of President Bill Clinton, the New York Times reports: Mr. Starr\u2019s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton. Now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator, looked the other way when Baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them. The relationship between athletes and sexual assault is a decades-old discussion. Since at least the 1980s, high-profile rape cases involving famous athletes have led the", "17 weird jobs you probably didn't know exist.

The idea that families come in all shapes and sizes has never been more true with adoption, same-sex relationships and the introduction of new ways to conceive. Writer Samuel Leighton-Dore, 25, spoke to Mirror Online about his decision for his sister to have his child - and has opened up about the negative response it has received. Samuel, from Sydney, is in a relationship with photographer and designer Bradley Tennant but doesn't want to miss out on their baby having both of their family's genes. As a compromise, his sister Bronte has agreed to donate her eggs so that the couple can have the family they've always wanted. Samuel told Mirror Online: \"It's not too strange when you break it down. We'll be using IVF. It'll be my sister's egg and my partner's sperm with a third-party surrogate, preferably someone who already has a family of their own. \"It's the only way my partner and I can both have a biological connection to our future children. \"It might sound vain to some people, but I think the desire to have a child with the person you love is pretty intrinsic and natural.\" The couple aren't entering into the decision lightly.

When looking for a place to live, people are generally looking for three things: affordability, a strong economy, and good quality of life. Most US cities can only claim excellence in one of these areas. A dozen cities specialize in two. But if you truly want it all, you only have three choices. And they\u2019re all in the Midwest. That\u2019s the finding of Josh Lehner at the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, who explored what\u2019s being called the \"housing trilemma\"\u2014the idea that due to the housing crisis, Americans have to make big tradeoffs in deciding where to live. Lehner looked at the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the country, comparing them for quality of life, affordability and economic strength across several metrics using Census data and several other indicators. According to his data (which you can see here), if you want a city that excels in all three, you have just three choices: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Omaha, Nebraska Des Moines, Iowa In fact, only 15 cities got high marks in two categories, most of them focused in quality of life.

According to The Associated Press, Tyler Comstock, 19, of Boone, was fatally shot the morning of Nov. 4 after a car chase with police ended on Iowa State University's central campus in Ames. Explaining how the teen found himself in a face-off with police, Comstock's family says that the events of that fateful morning had been triggered by an argument between the young man and his father. \"He just wanted a pack of cigarettes, and his dad wouldn\u2019t buy him a pack of cigarettes and he freaked out,\" the teen's mother, Shari Comstock, told the Iowa State Daily. After the feud, Comstock reportedly got into his father's car and took off. That's when his dad, James Comstock, decided to call the police to report his vehicle stolen. \"He took off with my truck. I call the police, and they kill him,\" James Comstock told the Des Moines Register. It is believed that the truck belonged to the lawn care company for which the father and son both worked. After James Comstock's call, police were soon on the teenager's tail. Comstock, however, reportedly refused to stop his vehicle and rammed into an officer's car.

The conclusion of Star Wars: The Force Awakens left us all with one question: Who are Rey's parents? While many people believed the final shot was a clue to Rey being a Skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a Kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series. But a new theory has awakened: that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine's granddaughter. YouTuber Vincent Vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it's pretty compelling. There's the matter of their fighting styles. Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move. This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust. Rey's first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine's fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental. This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey's parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides.

But did you know that many food and candy companies use unnecessary ingredients that can trigger hyperactivity, adding additional stress to families already coping with ADHD? Petroleum-based artificial food dyes are found in everything from cereal, yogurt, and granola bars to candy, chips, and even children's medicines! Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated that dyes can cause hyperactivity in sensitive children. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration acknowledges that. But the FDA has refused to ban dyes or even require a warning notice on labels, as the European Union does for most dyes. Ahead of October 31 this year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest is working with the Shutters family from Jamestown, N.Y. to publicize renewed attention to the link between artificial dyes and hyperactivity in kids, get the word out to families affected by ADHD, and encourage companies to stop coloring foods with these harmful dyes. Renee Shutters is a member of the Feingold Association, a group that promotes the use of an elimination diet to treat hyperactivity and other symptoms in children, focusing especially on the removal of artificial food dyes from the diet. Her son Trenton, age 9, used to exhibit hyperactive behavior and", "A Young Girl\u2019s Perfectly Preserved Body Was Unearthed. But What She\u2018s Holding Is a Mystery. It all started when Ericka Karner decided to remodel her childhood home in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District. Karner was not actually around at the time, however, as she had moved to Idaho to live with family members while the work took place. But, as construction workers arrived at the house, there was no indication that this job would be any different from others that they\u2019d done before. That said, this perception quickly changed not long after they began their work. Indeed, on May 9, 2016, three feet beneath the floor of the garage, the workers\u2019 shovels hit something solid. So, instead of soldiering on, they took the time to excavate the object, and they couldn\u2019t believe what they were seeing: it was a miniature coffin, about three feet in length. The two glass windows of the metal coffin unveiled the face of a little girl with pale skin and blond hair. Despite having been buried for a long time, though, the corpse looked amazingly well preserved. And, upon further examination, the workers identified one more interesting detail: the girl was clutching a red rose in her hands.

(CNN) American-Qatari artist Sophia Al-Maria is preparing for the biggest exhibition of her career. Her solo show \" Black Friday ,\" which opens at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art on July 26, will comprise over 100 new videos, screened on a series of broken or rejected consumer electronics. The title, Al-Maria says, is in part a reference to the American \"national holiday of shopping,\" but also a nod to the holy nature of Fridays in Islam. The exhibition \"posits the thought that shopping malls have become a kind of replacement for religious structures in our contemporary consumer society,\" she says. Gulf Futurism \"Black Friday\" sits comfortably in Al-Maria's roster of projects. Exemplifying of a new generation of creative polymaths, the writer-filmmaker-artist has produced photos, directed films, written articles and screenplays, and published a critically acclaimed memoir, \"The Girl Who Fell to Earth.\" In her memoir Al-Maria talks about being brought up between two vastly different cultures.

There, she experienced the intense and rapid technological and cultural development of the Gulf.

But thanks to modern science, researchers are now able to read what's on the scrolls without even opening them up. They'll do this with a new process that allows them to unroll the Herculaneum scrolls -- virtually. The process is called X-ray phase-contrast tomography. It virtually unwraps the scrolls and flattens out digital sheets of the physical carbonized document. That's a major development because the scrolls, which were buried in a Herculaneum library and excavated 260 years ago, are extremely fragile and could potentially be ruined by unwrapping using older, more invasive methods. Text being translated The technology could help scientists and others read other ancient scrolls that have been illegible for thousands of years. \"The goal of this technology is to make it accessible to all art historians, museums and libraries to virtually read ancient manuscripts that have been so damaged,\" says Alessia Cedola, a researcher and physicist at Italy's National Research Council. \"The result is significant because we are finally able to virtually see what's inside the scroll.\" So what do the scrolls say?

The town of No\u0308rdlingen -- a stop on Germany's Romantic Road -- sits entirely within a crater, made when a half-mile-wide meteorite smacked into Earth about 15 million years ago. The town's founders likely weren't aware they were settling in such a phenomenon -- in fact, people thought No\u0308rdlingen was built near a volcano until the 1960s. Either way, the little spot's perfectly round shape is all too pleasing to the eye. A common misconception is that No\u0308rdlingen's city walls are built right on the rim of a crater. The city does sit entirely within a crater, but that crater is actually about 15 miles in diameter -- aka it extends far, far beyond the village boundaries. You can see the rim from Daniel, the town's affectionately-named bell tower.

Set your camera settings so that you can forget about it for the rest of your photography session. When you are in a place where you want to enjoy and click as well, this is the first thing you need to do. Set your camera on Aperture priority mode where the camera will choose a shutter speed to give the right exposure while you control the ISO and aperture, or on Shutter priority mode wherein you can control the shutter speed. Depending on the location, you can adjust your shooting modes.  2. Find the right frame through your eyes first and then through the viewfinder.   Again, the fun in clicking candid shots is only when you are able to spot the right frames with your own eyes (because only your eyes can capture the story behind the picture). Avoid getting distracted by constantly looking through the camera\u2019s viewfinder. Instead, once you spot the right frame, move the viewfinder to your eye and click effortlessly in the exact frame which you saw through your eyes.  3. Shoot multiple shots at the same spot.

That includes his emphasis on terrorism, unsurprisingly, but also his preoccupation with immigration. This focus might be helping Trump, since Solomon\u2019s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him.

Researchers analyzed the diets of 852 people in New Hampshire, and the levels of arsenic in their toenails, which show long-term exposure to the chemical. Of the 120 foods the researchers looked at, four turned out to significantly raise people's arsenic levels: beer, white wine (and to a lesser extent, red wine), Brussels sprouts and dark-meat fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines, according to the study, published last week (Nov. 16) in the Nutrition Journal. The most significant source of arsenic in most people's diets is drinking water. The new study is the first to take into account the levels of arsenic in the participants' household water when looking at the amount of arsenic coming from foods. The results suggest that diet can be an important source of people's arsenic exposure over the long term, regardless of arsenic concentrations in their drinking water, the researchers said. The element arsenic occurs naturally in the environment. Long-term exposure to arsenic, even at low levels, has been linked to increased risks of bladder, lung and skin cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

She recently took the challenge, letting her almost 900,000 followers in on the meaning behind B.O.M.B, before clarifying that although the purpose of the B.O.M.B movement is to share each other\u2019s knowledge about black-owned makeup lines, it\u2019s far from exclusive. \u2018If you can slather 100 different highlighters on your face, I don\u2019t see how far-fetched it is to ask someone who is not black to support black-owned beauty brands,\u2019 she told her followers.

However, there was one issue that has been causing a lot of controversy in the theme park community: the queue.

Something about the human spirit compels us to go faster and farther. That\u2019s why Howard Hughes spent 1935 risking his life flying experimental planes to break speed barriers and why he took even graver risks in 1938 to fly around the world in record time. Hughes had everything to lose\u2014fame, fortune, beautiful girlfriends, some might say his mind\u2014and yet he needed to know what his machines could do. In the decades that followed, crisscrossing the globe turned from a daredevil feat into a regular occurrence. The jet engine had made its way out of the labs and into daily life. These new engines were far more powerful than propellers and allowed airplanes to travel faster and farther and\u2014crucially\u2014to do so reliably. Hughes, Pan Am\u2019s Juan Trippe, and others were quick to seize on the opportunity and built airline empires. The military began ordering fighter jets by the tens of thousands, and companies such as General Electric rushed to meet the demand. By the 1960s this one invention had shrunk the world.

Ecuador \u00a9 Gabrielle & Michel Therin-Weise/Getty Images Expatriates flock to Ecuador because of its gorgeous landscape, superior healthcare system and the generous government benefits extended to retirees, including discounts on utilities and public transportation. Housing is a steal in the capital city of Quito, with the monthly rent for a furnished, 900-square-foot apartment start at just $538. Utilities run $53 a month on average. Overall, Ecuador has a cost of living that's 58% cheaper than New York City. 2. Nicaragua \u00a9 Tan Yilmaz/Getty Images Nicaragua is located in the heart of Central America, and it's a premier retirement destination if you're looking for an excellent quality of life without a high price tag. The Nicaraguan government offers a number of financial incentives to attract foreign retirees, such as a sales tax exemption on construction materials if you're building a home. You need to be at least 45 years old and have a minimum monthly income of $600 to qualify, which may be appealing if you're considering an early retirement.

On the front porch, a large banner bears the photographs of five teenagers from the neighbourhood currently imprisoned by Israel. One of them is her 19-year-old son, Abed. The group stands accused of throwing stones at Israeli vehicles on a highway, allegedly causing the death of a driver, after clashes between police and Palestinian youths last September, on the eve of the Jewish New Year. The trial is still going on, but already some of their family members have been forced from their homes - the victims of new measures ostensibly aimed at deterring alleged Palestinian attackers. \"When we got the confiscation notice, we took all the furniture out, and now it's scattered with friends and neighbours,\" Sarah said, pushing back a metal sheet covering one window to sneak a look inside. Doorknobs to the home have been broken off, and entrances sealed with melted metal plates. Sarah, a widow for 15 years, and her 24-year-old daughter have moved to a smaller apartment in the same area, provided by a neighbour as a goodwill gesture. Sooner or later, they will have to start paying rent again, Sarah acknowledged - and with property prices sky-high in Jerusalem, they will not be able", "Some terrible things happened during one of the holiest weeks of the year. One of the holiest weeks of the year was marred by violence, bigotry and the deadly toll of war. For Christians, Palm Sunday kicked off the final days of Lent leading up to Easter. The Jewish holiday of Passover began Monday night, as many sat down to Seder meals to commemorate the Israelites\u2019 exodus from Egypt. And Thursday marked Vaisakhi, which celebrates the forming of the Khalsa Panth \u2015 the community of committed Sikhs. As millions of people gathered for prayer and celebration, a string of heinous and offensive events reminded them of life\u2019s fragility.

The reality is probably not that bad, but also not as click-worthy: Research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies indicates that nearly three-quarters of Millennials are saving for retirement and that we started doing so at an earlier age than previous generations. Wells Fargo data show that of those who are saving, half are putting away 6% of their income or more. What we're not so hot at, according to many of these same surveys, is investing. Many of us are frightened or confused by the topic and even inclined to put our money in a sock and call it a day. That's a problem, because investing the money you save is nearly as important as saving it in the first place. Here are five crucial moves Millennials can make to overcome their investing anxieties. 1. Get an education At least this one will be free. Investing is understandably scary. Until you learn what you're doing, it feels an awful lot like gambling in Vegas without the free drinks. There are plenty of resources to guide you through the basics; you just have to put in the time. Khan Academy is a good place to start, as is NerdWallet's guide", "Do Australian Dragons Dream? Sleep Discovery Surprises Scientists. Do dragons dream? Maybe, according to new research that finds rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep in a lizard, the Australian dragon, for the first time. The discovery suggests that these phases of sleep may be more than 100 million years older than previously realized. REM sleep is characterized by brain waves that look similar to waking brain activity. In mammals, the large muscles of the body are immobile, but the eyes twitch randomly during REM sleep. People do most of their dreaming in this phase of sleep. Slow-wave sleep is a non-REM sleep phase that is marked by slow brain waves called delta waves. [Top 10 Spooky Sleep Disorders] Quiet, sleep-like periods are known in many animals, even invertebrates like fruit flies. However, researchers had only found REM and slow-wave sleep brain activity in mammals and birds. Both of those kinds of animals diverged from a common group, the amniotes \u2014 mammals, reptiles and birds that lay eggs on land or hold them in their bodies \u2014 more than 300 million years ago. The amniotes gave rise to the synapsids and the sauropsids. Mammals are the only group of synapsids left (the earliest arose about 195 million years ago).", "'Stolen child'.

But there\u2019s one story from this set of games that has left us wondering: where\u2019s the love? [Scroll Down for Video] Kim Rhode is the FIRST WOMAN and (not insignificantly) the first Summer Olympian to medal in SIX consecutive Olympics.

Since they only happen every four years, we can assume Rhode has been winning for 20 years. Winning medals for 20 straight years. But her impressive career stretches farther back than that. Rhode began competing in skeet at age 10 and at 13, won her first world championship title in women\u2019s double trap shooting.

On the face of it, there do not appear to be many parallels between being a sex blogger and a secret service agent. However, there is one key similarity: maintaining anonymity at all times and thus leading a double life. For Girl On The Net, remaining anonymous is a constant source of consternation, angst and exhaustion. From using a burner phone which can\u2019t be traced, to fastidiously wiping the internal location data for every photo she uploads, to keeping her job a secret from friends and relatives, there is the always omnipresent, never shakeable fear that someone is going to come along and uncover her identity.

The company is called Moon Express, and they\u2019re planning to send a small unmanned lander called MX-1E to the Moon in late 2017. They already have a launch contract to do this with a company called Rocket Lab, but getting approval for the landing was a major hurdle. \"The US Government has made a historic ruling to allow the first private enterprise, Moon Express, permission to travel beyond Earth\u2019s orbit and land on the Moon in 2017,\" the company said in a statement, adding the decision would begin \"a new era of ongoing commercial lunar exploration and discovery, unlocking the immense potential of the Moon\u2019s valuable resources.\" Announced yesterday, the approval came from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Office of Commercial Space Transportation.

Millennials are going against this major engagement and wedding tradition More There are some wedding traditions that are starting to feel dated, such as the idea that wedding rings have to include real diamonds to be special. Apparently the diamond business is experiencing a slow period , because the newest trend for millennials is to marry later in their 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, and choose more distinctive wedding jewelry that accounts for their concern with money, sustainability, and material. Many young people of today don\u2019t want their engagement and wedding rings to be mass-produced, they want a piece that\u2019s unique to them and also doesn\u2019t cost a fortune. And so, millennials are favoring gemstones, sapphires, and lab-grown diamonds over actual diamonds. This may be because they\u2019re no longer concerned with age-old marriage rituals, and colorful stones might reflect their taste better. The trend may also have something to do with greater awareness about the human rights issues surrounding diamond mining and production in some regions.

In a study published in peer-reviewed journal PLOS One Wednesday, a team from the University of Louisville in Kentucky described a new cervical cancer screening method that can also indicate the stage of the cancer. So how does it work? Using some of the patient's blood plasma, researchers generate a plasma thermogram by heating the sample. Once the blood plasma is \"melted,\" it produces a unique signature based on proteins in blood. The signature then serves as an indicator, denoting whether the specific biomarkers for cervical cancer are present. The heat test also goes a step further and allows researchers to see the extent to which the cancer has spread. Lead researcher Nichola Garbett, Ph.D., said the key to screening for the cancer lies in the shape of each patient's individual heat profile. By comparing test results, doctors should also be able to adjust cancer treatments for each patient. \"We have been able to establish thermograms for a number of diseases. Comparing blood samples of patients who are being screened or treated against those thermograms should enable us to better monitor patients as they are undergoing treatment and follow-up,\" he said in a statement released by the university.

The new dinosaur, dubbed Siats meekerorum, is part of a group of giant predators known as carcharodontosaurs, and it's only the second of this group to be discovered in North America. Siats meekerorum in its marshy habitat keeps small-bodied tyrannosaurs from its kill. North Carolina State University paleontologist Lindsay Zanno discovered the Siats bones eroding out of a hillside in Utah in 2008. \"It's easily the most exciting thing that I've found so far,\" Zanno, who heads the paleontology lab at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science, told LiveScience. Lizard kings T. rex lived in the late Cretaceous period about 65 million years ago. Paleontologists know a good deal about the \"tyrant lizard\" and its ecosystem in North America, just as they know lots about the Late Jurassic period, the time of such famous dinos as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus and Stegosaurus, Zanno said. But between the two, there's a 60-million-year gap. [Image Gallery: The Life of T. Rex] \"There's a huge gap in our understanding of what lived in between those two really unique dinosaur ecosystems,\" Zanno said. For that reason, Zanno and her colleagues focused on 98-million-year-old rocks, right in the middle of that gap.

San Diego man Matthew Jackson was in line for groceries one day back in November when the woman in front of him started having a hard time. Jamie-Lynne Knighten's infant was crying and her credit card had been declined. She was totally frazzled, so Jackson instinctively stepped up to the plate and covered her bill, asking that she pay it forward to someone else whenever she had the chance. Knighten was stunned by his generosity. She ended up tracking down where Jackson worked so that she could thank him for all he'd done. When his manager answered the phone and heard what Knighten had to say, she broke down into tears. Just one day after bringing so much kindness into someone's life, he was killed in a horrific accident. For more information, watch the video below.

Rebecca Melia never got to tell her mom she was pregnant. Melia, 30, was overjoyed to conceive, but just as she began to plan for the new life entering the world, another life was about to exit. At six months pregnant, Melia went to the doctor for a routine ultrasound. That\u2019s when the emotional roller coaster of the past few months really came to a head. At first, the procedure was totally normal. Technicians operated the equipment. They collected the images. Nurses were supposed to bring out the pictures, but there was some sort of delay. Melia started to get nervous. \"They had me there for a long time and I could tell they had seen something on the scan,\" she told the Daily Mail. In fact, they had, but Melia could never have guessed what it was. Melia was beginning to panic. \"I was convinced it was something wrong with my boy,\" she said. After what seemed like an eternity, a nurse emerged from the back room. She had a peculiar smile on her face. Melia peered at the ultrasound image.

I also did it because I was sick of my single status dictating the way I looked.Once I booked the appointment, though, the panic set in. Did I make the right decision? Would my hair fall out?

Apple Watch 2 One of the biggest unknowns is if we\u2019ll hear anything about new Apple Watch hardware tomorrow. A few leaks have shown off improvements like a better battery , a thinner display, and at some point Apple was thinking about putting an LTE radio in there. An Apple Watch announcement this year would line up nicely with the original Watch announcement, which came alongside the iPhone 6 launch in 2014. The Watch itself wasn\u2019t released until April the following year, to allow for production to ramp up. That would make sense \u2014 we haven\u2019t seen as many Apple Watch leaks as you\u2019d expect if a new Watch was coming to stores in a few weeks. I\u2019d expect any new Apple Watch to be more of a marginal improvement and spec bump than complete overhaul. Apple put a huge amount of work (and marketing money) into talking up the design of the original Apple Watch, and aesthetically, there\u2019s little to change. At the very least, a new Apple Watch would likely be compatible with existing Apple Watch straps, otherwise there will be some very annoyed customers with very expensive accessories.

Massachusetts' highest court is currently hearing a case against the Pledge brought by atheist parents, who feel that due to its religious wording, atheist children \"are denied meaningful participation in this patriotic exercise.\" The case specifically involves the phrase, \"under God,\" which was not actually a part of the original phrasing of the Pledge. Regarding atheists, Perino said during a live segment, \"I'm tired of them.\" She continued, \"I remember working at the Justice Department years ago when I first started right after 9/11 and a lawsuit like this came through, and before the day had finished, the United States Senate and the House of Representatives had both passed resolutions saying that they were for keeping \u2018under God\u2019 in the pledge.\" \"If these people really don't like it, they don't have to live here,\" she concluded.

She says it\u2019s better for her wallet, and starting early better accommodates her work schedule. \"It really helps to spread out the spending that I want to do and really start to look at the things or experiences I want to give to others,\" says Erin. \"Also, August through February is my busiest time at work. So I make sure I try to cross things off my list early in the process.\" Erin also uses shopping early as a way to stick to a budget. She puts away money for the holidays well in advance, which guarantees she isn\u2019t draining her bank account as the holidays approach. It also spaces out her spending, and ensures she\u2019s not paying sizeable holiday markups on her purchases. \"I start saving early so I have a little stash that I know is for others.

Living in Montreal, Canada, Servat and Bienvenue were ecstatic to start a family and welcome a new baby into their lives. As weeks passed, and after multiple visits to the doctor, Bienvenue told Servat that she was actually expecting twins. Then, the 37-year-old mother-to-be announced that she was expecting triplets, then quadruplets, and finally claimed that she and Servat were going to be the parents of five newborn babies. To track their journey, the couple started a Facebook page to document the pregnancy where they posted the many gifts given to them by family members, neighbours, and even businesses that offered their generous support. \u2018I used my personal and professional contacts,\u2019 a friend of Barbara\u2019s told The Toronto Sun, \u2018to get her sponsorships.\u2019 \u2018Others gave her all sorts of clothes and furniture,\u2019 she added.

Where did he come from? Should I be thanking his mother and four older sisters for the man he is today? Probably. The first time I heard Olivier call himself a feminist, we were having a discussion about the extreme differences between Hillary Clinton and Michelle Bachmann. He not only used the word feminist to describe himself, but also pointed out that with so many women in his life, how could he NOT be a feminist? How could he not want equality for each and every one of them? And I'd ask you: How could a woman not want to be with a feminist man?

How to choose the best photo of yourself? Let someone else choose it for you. A team at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, carried out an investigation into the process by which people chose their profile pictures for the journal Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications. The research, entitled 'Choosing face: The curse of self in profile image selection' found that images that participants selected of themselves made a less favourable impression than those selected by strangers. Here's how the research was carried out: A helpful diagram: The study found that images of participants selected by strangers made a far more favourable impression on others, than those photos selected by participants of themselves. According to Dr David White, lead author on the study: Our results demonstrate that people know how to select profile pictures that fit specific networking contexts and make positive impressions on strangers: dating images appear more attractive, and professional images appear more competent. Previous work has shown that people make inferences about an individual's character and personality within a split second of seeing a photograph of their face, so our results have clear practical implications;", "Explainer: Is There Any Science Behind Astrology? Looking at the star signs from a scientific standpoint. A hospital in Argentina is reportedly using astrology to help treat some mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety, by giving patients an understanding of their astrological personalities. The guidance is given based on the patient\u2019s sign \u2014 whether he or she is an Aries, Taurus, or so forth \u2014 and the leading astrologist develops a star chart for each patient. Unsurprisingly, the astrology workshop is being met with criticism over its scientific validity.

In particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function. Studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths. Unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light. Blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources. Research investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise. A new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep. Scientists at China's Sichuan University studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery. The study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes. Cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye's damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens. Cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts. The study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability.

Radcliffe was in attendance at the Deauville Film Festival, where he was the recipient of the Rising Star Award, and The Hollywood Reporter asked him the big question.

The archaeologists have been excavating a city near the Giza Pyramids that dates mainly to the reign of the pharaoh Menkaure, who built the last pyramid at Giza. Also near the pyramids they have been excavating a town, located close to a monument dedicated to Queen Khentkawes, possibly a daughter of Menkaure. The barracks are located at the city, while a newly discovered basin, that may be part of a harbor, is located by the Khentkawes town. Several discoveries at the city and Khentkawes town suggest Giza was a thriving port, said archaeologist Mark Lehner, the director of Ancient Egypt Research Associates. For instance, Lehner's team discovered a basin beside the Khentkawes town just 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) from the nearest Nile River channel.

But that's not necessarily true. A trio of the most recent polls show Trump trailing Clinton in a head-to-head contest. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday found Clinton leading Trump by 13 points, 51 percent to 38 percent. In an ABC/Washington Post poll also out Wednesday, he trailed her by 9 points, 50 percent to 41 percent. And a CNN/ORC poll released in early March found Clinton's lead over Trump to be 8 points, 52 percent to 44 percent. In fact, the last time any national poll showed him leading Clinton--and only a few have--was one from USA Today/Suffolk back in February, which gave Trump a 2-point lead over Clinton. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was correct when he said he does fare better than Trump against Clinton in the most recent polling. In the NBC/WSJ poll, for example, Cruz trailed Clinton by just 2 points (47 percent to 45 percent). And in the CNN/ORC poll, Cruz led Clinton by 1 point, 49 percent to 48 percent. Florida Sen.

CoSchedule, Fast Company, HubSpot, ShortStack, Forbes, Hootsuite, QuickSprout and others all claim to have the answers to such seemingly simple questions as \"When is the best time to post on Facebook?\" and \"How often should you post stories on Facebook?\" However, many of the strategies used by publishers for optimizing engagement and boosting referral traffic from social are flawed. Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal \"best times\" to share content on Facebook. We analyzed the median traffic that articles received from Facebook three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year\u2019s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn\u2019t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries. Firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher. As can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. The British and French publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both", "The new #SpiderMan movie finally got a title:.

You decide!\" Another conspiracy theorist noted the absence of any obvious Secret Service agents nearby when the Democratic presidential candidate walked out of Chelsea\u2019s Manhattan apartment building. Some citizen sleuths claimed the woman emerging from Chelsea\u2019s apartment was actually someone named Teresa Barnwell \u2014 who is the spitting image of the presidential candidate. Barnwell added fuel to the fire when she posted a photo of herself outside the same building wearing sunglasses with the caption: \"Maybe I was in New York.\" But Barnwell has an ironclad alibi to prove that she was not in New York. She was impersonating Clinton 3,000 miles away in Los Angeles over the weekend.

Nick Nelson, Netflix's global manager of creative services, detailed the research in a company blog post. \"Broadly, we know that if you don't capture a member's attention within 90 seconds, that member will likely lose interest and move onto another activity,\" he wrote. When you browse the site, you spend 82% of your time looking at artwork, rather than reading titles or descriptions. So if Netflix doesn't give you photos that look cool, you'll likely just close the tab and check Facebook again instead. Armed with that information, Netflix figured out exactly what gets users to click on a photo, and the results are a fascinating look at what makes us tick. If an image features a person, that person should be showing a complex emotion, not simply happiness or sadness. They illustrated that with promos for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt; the winner had Kimmy and Titus reacting to something in an inscrutable way.

It's formally celebrating St. Patrick's Day for the first time \u2014 but on March 30. Earlier this month, the church announced it would finally recognize the day in commemoration of Saint Patrick, a missionary who had lived in the 5th century and is now widely known as the patron saint of Ireland. Orthodox leaders told the Russian media they hoped that recognizing Saint Patrick and a number of other western saints would show the shared roots of different branches of Christianity, before the Schism of 1054 that divided the faith into East and West. Despite this, the divide between the two wings of Christianity means that the Russian Orthodox Church will not celebrate St. Patrick's Day along with the rest of the world. While the Catholic Church adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century, the Russian Orthodox Church still uses the older Julian calendar. The two calendars are about two weeks out of sync. This means that the day of St. Patrick's death \u2014 March 17 in the Gregorian calendar \u2014 falls on March 30 for the Russian Orthodox Church. The March 30 date seems likely to extend Russia's St. Patrick's Day festivities rather than replace them.

Snapchat is now looking to raise about $200 million in new funding, which means that the company can be worth a pretty penny if investors help it out. This new round of funding is an extension of the Series F round from March, where Snapchat raised $175 million from Fidelity. This fundraising gave the company a valuation of $16 billion. According to VC Experts, if Snapchat is able to raise its desired $200 million the company will then be valued at $22.7 billion. Of course this is just an estimate since this valuation is based on the fact that Snapchat would remain $30.72 per share. It would also mean that Snapchat has raised a total of more than $1.5 billon in funding. While this large valuation reveals Snapchat's success, it could also make it harder for another company to acquire it in the future the more expensive it becomes. Facebook attempted to do exactly this when it tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion back in 2013. Snapchat continues to be privately owned Popular among teens, Snapchat has exploded as of late.

He was picked up by officials of Delhi Police's special cell and Special Task Force (STF) of Kashmir Police.Two days later - after allegedly subjecting him to torture and humiliation at an STF camp - they brought him to Delhi. His crime: he was alleged to have planted a bomb in a DTC bus in Govindpuri on October 29, 2005, which injured many people. Twelve years later, when he walked free on Thursday - after additional sessions judge Reetesh Singh acquitted him of all charges - the police were facing serious questions of credibility and human rights violations. Rafiq's claim that \"he was made an accused to assuage the public perception that Delhi Police was incompetent to act against terrorism\" and that \"he was a vulnerable target... made a scapegoat\" rang true. Police, it seems, deliberately ignored his alibi at every step to prove their case. They brushed aside his plea that it could be proved he was in his class on the day of the blast. It relied on dubious witnesses who ended up contradicting themselves, exposed Rafiq to many people when he was in custody before a test identification parade (TIP) could be conducted and suppressed inconvenient facts.

April's take puts the state on pace to collect $156 million in cannabis taxes and fees over the next 12 months, but Colorado's total haul from marijuana next fiscal year (which begins July 1) is likely to be a lot more than that. Why? Because marijuana sales continue to grow. In the current fiscal year, Colorado has collected $125 million in marijuana taxes and fees, up 55% from the same time last year. Colorado's success bodes well for other states considering recreational marijuana laws this fall. Voters in the Golden State will take up the issue of recreational marijuana in November; if the measure is OK'd, then taxes and fees generated by cannabis in California could dwarf Colorado's figures. California's state government reported in December that annual marijuana taxes and fees associated with recreational marijuana could total in the \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" and that they could potentially be as high as $1 billion. That tax revenue would come largely from a 15% sales tax on marijuana, but it would also come from marijuana cultivation taxes of $9.25 per ounce for dried marijuana flowers, and $2.75 per ounce for dried marijuana leaves.

The Amazon CEO elaborated by saying that it would be theoretically easier to propel bulk materials from the moon than the Earth, due to its low gravity. \"If you're gonna need a lot of supplies and fuel and bulk materials to go to Mars, you're much better lifting them off the moon than you are lifting them off the Earth.

That was Jawbone's thinking behind the Mini Jambox, the latest in Jawbone's lineup of Bluetooth-enabled speakers, which went on sale on Wednesday for $179. The Mini Jambox is exactly what it sounds like: An even smaller version of the brick-like Jambox. Like its bigger and older siblings, the Jambox (also $179) and Big Jambox ($299), Mini Jambox is a rectangular speaker that connects to any device that has Bluetooth. Phones, tablets, music players or computers with Bluetooth can wirelessly send audio to the speaker, while devices without Bluetooth can connect to a 3.5 mm jack that allows for wired playback. At six inches long, one inch wide and just over two inches tall, the Mini Jambox is about half the width of the Jambox, which is already a pretty small speaker. To put that in perspective: it's about the size of a pencil case, weighs as much as two smartphones, and easily fits into a small purse or the pocket of a pair of pants. The idea behind the Mini Jambox was to design a speaker that, like a phone or tablet, can be carried with you at all times, Travis Bogard, vice president of product management at Jawbone, said in", "15 horror stories that prove nurses have the toughest job in the world. \u2014ninernurse \"My mother was a nurse, and a guy came in with his foot SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE \u2013 I'm talking, like, between his toes to his ankle.

She succeeds another Miss New York, Mallory Hagan, whose tenure was cut short when the pageant moved back to Atlantic City after a six-year stint in Las Vegas, where winners were chosen in January. Davuluri performed a classical Bollywood fusion dance for her talent competition. She is the first winner of Indian descent. After the traditional frolic in the Atlantic City surf Monday morning, she will head to the scene of a devastating boardwalk fire in Seaside park and Seaside Heights Monday afternoon.", "All Blue-Eyed People Have This One Thing In Common. Originally, all humans had brown eyes, although genetic variation relating to a gene called OCA2 resulted in changes to the amount of pigment produced by different individuals, resulting in the emergence of different shades of brown. Armed with this information, scientists had for many years searched for the source of blue eyes on the OCA2 gene, but without success. More recently, a mutation to a separate, nearby gene called HERC2 has been identified as the cause of blue eyes. This alteration switches off OCA2, the gene that determines the amount of the brown pigment melanin that we make. It is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from Africa to Europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early European. The fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery. To date, the earliest set of sapphire-colored peepers ever found belong to a 7,000-year-old skeleton that was discovered in northern Spain. Naturally, the eyes had long since decayed, however genetic analysis revealed that they would have appeared blue in color.", "The \"Mary Tyler Moore\" cast reunites.

Earlier this week, it was confirmed that Battlefield 1 would be getting its first proper gameplay reveal during E3, where the game\u2019s 64-player multiplayer mode will be shown to the public and press for the first time. The producer teased some really interesting stuff when speaking to OXM (Official Xbox Magazine), the most interesting of which was a new melee system that the team is adding to the game, especially in the multiplayer portion. Although he didn\u2019t go into details but he was quick to state that since Battlefield 1 takes place during world war 1, the game is from an era which didn\u2019t have modern day weapons or combat, and hand-to-hand combat among soldiers was almost medieval.

In a study published in August, researchers from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences found that working in an environment with live plants increased employees scores on memory tests, supporting previous findings that vegetation can help us be more productive.

And, according to studies, even brief encounters with nature -- such as a glimpse of a plant on a desk -- can have major restorative effects. \"If you have little moments of looking up and seeing something that brings that resource back a little bit, some of those should make a huge difference,\" Kaplan said.

Now scientists may have found the missing link -- it's not only people's genetic makeup that determines people's reaction to broccoli's bitter taste, but also how these genes are instructed to make taste receptors, according to a new study published today (Sept. 11) in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The most-studied gene for bitter taste receptor, TASR38, comes in two types. People who have only one type or the other may be at the extremes -- they are either very sensitive to bitterness, or don't taste it unless it's very strong. But most people are somewhere in between, having one copy of each type. However, even within this group of \"moderate tasters\" who have the same genes, there is greatly varied sensitivity to bitterness. [Tip of the Tongue: The 7 (Other) Flavors Humans May Taste] In the study, 18 people with the same bitter taste genes rated the bitterness level of several beverages, including broccoli juice and carrot juice. The researchers took small samples of tissue from the participants' taste buds. Taste buds, small bumps that cover the tongue, contain taste receptors. The researchers measured the amount of a molecule in the taste buds, called messenger RNA (mRNA), which contains", "The strange word everyone is saying/texting.

Trump was supposed to do a \"surprise\" publicity stunt at the 2012 convention, but it was canceled when a tropical storm hit Tampa. These earlier convention speeches have even launched careers. In 2004, Illinois Senate candidate Barack Obama rocketed to national fame after a well-received speech at the Democratic national convention. Four years later, he was the party's nominee. Even poorly reviewed speeches, such as then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's famously meandering address in 1988, have been clues to future nominations. Other nominees have been onstage because of their close ties to a prior administration, such as Vice", "How to fix lag in SSB4 on 3DS. The game is superb -- which is why it pains us that no matter what stage we choose, our Smash Bros 4 fights always take place in Lag City. We got a hint of this when we did our review for SSB43DS but chalked it up to all other players being located halfway across the world in Japan. Now that the game's out in our country, we thought our lag issues would be alleviated. Boy were we wrong. Now, don't get us wrong -- we agree with Louis CK . The fact that we can play a video game with anyone around the world is amazing. But Smash is serious business. Despite being a fighting game, the lag is pretty consistent. So, we quantified it. (Smash bros) Super Smash Bros 4 Lag: Online Multiplayer We began our testing using both the For Fun and For Glory modes on the 3DS. Similar to when I played Sm4sh for the review, we experienced constant lag throughout gameplay. During our For Fun plays, button presses were consistently between .30 to .40 milliseconds late. Not a huge amount obviously, though certainly noticeable. During our 3rd match during For Fun while playing online using our home", "And the world's most honest cities are...

This Wednesday, as part of World Oceans Day, Norton Point will launch their first line of sunglasses made from recovered consumer ocean plastics as part of their #SeaPlasticDifferently campaign. With plastic collected from Haiti, the glasses not only look cool, but promote sustainable business practices. Elite Daily had a chance to speak with Ryan Schoenike about the process of developing a product from our plastic waste and growing an eco-friendly company. After linking up with a college buddy in March of last year, Schoenike and his partner came up with the idea to source ocean plastic for a unique line of eyewear. But despite the shocking amount of garbage in our marine ecosystem, he admits gathering it wasn\u2019t as easy as they expected, saying, One of the issues we had found early on was that ocean plastic is this big problem and it\u2019s really prevalent, but it\u2019s really hard to get a hold of some ocean plastic. There just aren\u2019t people that are collecting it.

Why do we make things so complicated? Take retirement accounts for example. It seems like a simple concept. Enable people to save money tax-deferred during their working years, and then tax the investments when they are withdrawn from the account in retirement. Yet our beloved government has managed to complicate this simple concept. Let's start with the types of retirement accounts. If you think there is just a 401k or IRA, think again. Here's just a partial list: Traditional 401k Roth 401k Self-Directed 401k Safe-Harbor 401k Tiered Profit Sharing 401k Simple 401k (my personal favorite) Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) Roth IRA SEP IRA Inherited IRA Simple IRA And that's just a short list. I haven't even touched 403b plans, 457 plans, or defined benefit plans. The complications go far beyond the type of retirement plans. There's the question of whether traditional IRA contributions are deductible. Should you invest in a Roth or traditional retirement account, or both? Many are asking if they should convert traditional retirement account funds to a Roth account. Part of that question brings up the Backdoor Roth. And forget about calculating your Required Minimum Distribution on your own. In the midst of all this complexity, today let's", "I Made These Changes to How I Grocery Shop and Now I Save $200+/Month.

Few people get worked up over the occasional bruise. We know from experience that a purplish spot isn't usually cause for alarm and, in time, will clear up on its own -- a classic case of the wait-and-see approach making sound medical sense. But other discolorations that may appear harmless can serve as warning signals for serious diseases, like diabetes, skin cancer, and autoimmune disorders. The sooner you pick up on the clues, the faster you can take the right steps to getting and staying healthier. Red Tongue Pay attention to the color of your tongue. If it becomes a bright, beefy red (the change can be subtle, but it will be noticeable), you may be low on vitamin B12. This vitamin is essential for making the red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body and plays a vital role in maintaining brain function. While researchers aren't sure why a B12 deficiency affects the tongue, you may develop neurological problems, including dementia, if your levels stay low for too long. Protect Yourself: Meat and dairy products are rich in B12, so if you're a vegetarian or vegan, you may have a harder time reaching your daily allowance.

A woman who brandished the severed head of a four-year-old girl in her care outside a Moscow metro station has said she beheaded the child to avenge Muslims killed in the Kremlin's campaign of air strikes in Syria. In video posted online on Thursday and circulated by several prominent bloggers, 38-year-old Gulchekhra Bobokulova from Muslim-majority Uzbekistan gave her first detailed explanation of an incident that state TV channels chose not to report. \"I took revenge against those who spilled blood,\" Bobokulova told someone asking her questions off camera. \"Putin spilled blood, planes carried out bombings. Why are Muslims being killed? They also want to live.\" She also said she had wanted to go to live in Syria but did not have the money to do so. It was not clear when the video was filmed, but Bobokulova wore the same clothes as when she appeared in court on Wednesday.

They may have stumbled onto their vocations. Or they always had a passion \u2014 but found a very unorthodox way of finding their routes to achieving their dreams. Take Jonathan Goldsmith, the actor who plays the \"Most Interesting Man in the World\" character in commercials for Dos Equis. After first moving to Los Angeles, he worked on a garbage truck, according to an NPR interview. He lied his way into westerns, pretending to know how to ride a horse, and eventually played villains, even though he had always wanted to do comedy. He finally got a chance, decades after starting acting and while trying to refresh his movie career by auditioning for a commercial by imitating his sailing buddy, Fernando Lamas. \"It only took 50 years,\" Goldsmith said. \"An overnight success.\" Even CEOs and power brokers have had unconventional starts.

So many direwolves have died in Game of Thrones that I genuinely have no idea whose is still alive and whose is dead. It's time for me to recap. Oh, usual shit with spoilers by the way... Anyway, as you should remember, each of the Stark kids got given a direwolf when they found a litter by a dead mother wolf in the very first episode. Since then the direwolves have slowly but surely been killed off. Sansa's wolf, Lady, was beheaded by Ned Stark on the way to King's Landing. Robb's direwolf, Grey Wind, was shot by an arrow while caged at The Red Wedding. Rickon's wolf, Shaggydog, was killed by the Umbers when he was captured and presented to Ramsay Bolton.

With the iconic Crocodylus porosus as perhaps the sartorial ancestor, clothing logos have evolved and swelled in the past decades. On mid-tier brands like Abercombie & Fitch or Juicy Couture they could take up an entire sweatshirt or posterior.

That's the case of John and Lorena Bobbitt, whose marriage came to a tumultuous close when Lorena cut off John's penis while he was sleeping. That isn't to say that John didn't deserve it.

The celestial critter in the new Hubble telescope photo is actually a cloud of gas stretching one light-year (10 trillion kilometers) across, scientists say. This cloud is in the process of collapsing down under its own gravity to give birth to a star \u2014 but it's a race against time, because the established bright stars in its vicinity are fighting this process. There are 65 extremely hot, bright stars lurking nearby the cloud, visible on the right side of the image. A powerful stellar wind is blowing out from these stars, as well as 500 less bright companions nearby, gradually eroding the caterpillar cloud. The cloud is fighting back, too, though, bulking up over time by collecting material surrounding its outer envelope. Whether the caterpillar will gather enough mass to counteract the erosion is unclear. \"Only time will tell if the formed star will be a 'heavy-weight' or a 'light-weight' with respect to its mass,\" NASA scientists wrote in a statement.

Mother Heidi Marintzer quickly took the photo after she felt confident the tornado was about three miles away -- far enough not to hurt her family, the Daily Mail reports. Ali also took a Snapchat selfie with the tornado later. \"Selfie ft. Tornado #prom2k16,\" Ali captioned the selfie. \"Our pic together was after it died down a little,\" Ali wrote on Facebook, referring to the photo her mother took. Despite the fact the twister eventually injured five people, Wray High School decided not to cancel their prom, although they delayed it by 45 minutes so everybody could safely arrive, the Daily Mail notes. Tornadoes are expected to continue to affect the area with a possible chance of hail on May 9. Yet unusual prom experiences are far more common than many might think, Jezebel reports. In one particularly rough incident, an unidentified girl discovered she was allergic to shellfish on her prom day. \"As I started to scratch my neck I felt a lump about the size of an egg at the base", "The weirdly hydrating thing you should drink after a workout. The researchers wanted to see how the sports drink Powerade stacked up against different kinds of milk, so they subjected 15 men to four rounds of cycling on separate days. Each workout was followed by a different beverage: cow\u2019s milk, soy milk, a milk-based meal supplement or Powerade. Researchers then measured their blood and urine to determine hydration and nutrient levels. Drinking a milk-based meal supplement after exercise led to better fluid retention than the other drinks, but all of the milk-based products were superior to Powerade in terms of rehydrating the body post-exercise. None of the beverages made the cyclers thirstier than any other. That said, Powerade had an edge in one regard: The men reported that the sports juice was the most pleasant (soy milk, unsurprisingly, was the least). Those who drank milk reported being more bloated and feeling more full\u2014probably due to the protein content in milk\u2014but they were more rehydrated compared to sports drinks. And as for water? Drinking plain water after exercise actually causes a drop in sodium levels, potentially leading to even more dehydration, the study authors note.

Primarily built for the purpose of protection, these magnificent structures defined an entire era and most certainly shaped the course of history. To say that medieval castles are very complex structures is clearly not enough, and that is why we need to have a look at the details of these defensive fortifications. The Moat One of the most important elements used in the defense of a medieval castle is without a doubt the moat, a wide, deep body of water that surrounds the castle. Apart from being an impressive sight to behold and a perfect obstacle to slow down the advance of enemy armies, the castle moat\u2019s most important function was to prevent any attackers from digging tunnels. Castles without moats often faced the risk of being attacked from below. Invaders would dig a tunnel under the walls that could eventually help them penetrate the castle by causing the wall to collapse. A moat was the perfect defensive mechanism against tunnel digging, as it would likely collapse and the tunnel would be filled with water before the invaders could undermine the castle wall. Concentric Circles Developed in around the 13th century, this extraordinary method of defense offered the best protection against", "Woman Can\u2019t Believe How Much Her Grandma\u2019s Tiffany Lamp Is Actually Worth. In my house, there is an entire china cabinet dedicated to all of the things my grandmother wanted me to have. Some things have to be well over 100 years old. Have you ever wanted what some of these items might cost? I would never dream of selling her fine china, but other items in the collection make me curious. Many people take things that have been passed down among generations of the family and have them appraised. When Antiques Roadshow rolls into town, many cannot resist the temptation.

All of Grandma\u2019s grandchildren used to play with the \"brain lamp\" as they called it, and it eventually went to her. While she had thought it was Tiffany, she was very happy to have that confirmed by Kathy. But she is completely stunned when Kathy reveals it\u2019s worth about $30,000 to $40,000.

And if you're not dazzled by the epic natural wonders Colorado has to offer, you might not have a soul. Not convinced? Maybe these 19 reasons will prove that Colorado is the most magical state in America. 1. Because with \"300 days of sunshine,\" Colorado is one of the sunniest places in America. And who doesn't love a sunny day? The \"300 days of sunshine\" thing is actually a myth. According to the Colorado Climate Center, there's no technical definition of \"days of sunshine,\" so measuring it gets tricky. They go on, however, to state that Colorado only has 30-40 overcast days per year, leaving at least 300 days of partial sunshine. They estimate only about 115 days that would fit the classic definition of clear... but 300 days of partial sunshine, at the least, still sounds awesome. 2. Being at a high altitude just makes things more fun. Colorado has the highest average elevation in the country. The lowest point in Colorado, located at the Arikaree River, is 3,315 feet above sea level. The", "The Miami Dolphins' new home field is called...

Kernen\u2019s comments play off common stereotypes regarding 7-Eleven franchisees and Asian immigrants. For example, the long-running cartoon show the Simpsons has perpetuated this stereotype with a character named Apu, who has an Indian accent and runs a \"Kwik-E-Mart,\" a convenience store inspired by 7-Eleven. When the real-life convenience store chain transformed some of its locations into Kwik-E-Marts to promote the Simpsons movie in 2007, some Indian-American store owners weren\u2019t exactly thrilled with the idea, the Associated Press reported at the time. But at least there are some prominent voices out there looking debunk the stereotype.

This week, Apple announced a number of new features for the Apple Watch, including an app due out this fall called Breathe, which will \"encourage users to take a moment in their day to do deep breathing exercises for relaxation and stress reduction,\" the company said in a statement. The app will guide users though a timed breathing session, lasting 1 to 5 minutes. The watch can track a user's heart rate, and so at the end of a session, users will see a summary of their heart rate data, Apple said. Although some experts recommend up to 20 minutes of breathing exercises a day, just 5 minutes of breathing exercises can help people feel calmer and refreshed, said Nancy Harazduk, director of the Mind-Body Medicine Program at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C. Studies suggest that deep-breathing exercises may reduce certain types of stress and anxiety, and can temporarily lower blood pressure. But many of these studies have been small, so more research is needed to learn more about the exact benefits of deep-breathing exercises, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Deep breathing is a type of relaxation technique that is intended to counteract", "Another university blocks students from passing out copies of the Constitution. In a federal lawsuit filed Thursday, Merritt Burch and Anthony Vizzone claim their First Amendment right to free speech was infringed upon during a January event where school officials stopped them as they passed out copies of the Constitution, according to Fox News. Burch and Vizzone, who were there to represent the campus\u2019 chapter of Young Americans for Liberty, were told that campus policy dictates members of clubs and organizations are not allowed to approach fellow students and solicit them. The complaint also states that the university \"unconstitutionally restricts access to open areas on campus by requiring students to seek permission to speak at least seven business days in advance.\" Without getting prior permission, students who wish to exercise their freedom are relegated to a small \"free speech zone\" on the edge of campus, which the students\u2019 lawyers say is not particularly accessible or in a high-traffic area. Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which is assisting in the lawsuit, went so far as to call the undesirable zone a \"censorship swamp.\" \"The First Amendment is not optional at public colleges -- it\u2019s the law,\" Lukianoff said in a statement. \"Enforcing restrictive \u2018free speech zone\u2019 policies", "Alarming find in kids' blood forces Michigan city to declare state of emergency. \"I can tell you today that we need state and federal assistance for the people to feel comfortable.

By knocking off 10 hours of work each week for a year, employees at a Swedish nursing home were able to improve their health, cut back on sick leave, and enhance the care of their charges, The New York Times reports. Under the experiment, which focused on the future of work in Gothenburg, employees began working six-hour days at the same pay rate as their previous eight-hour days.

A court or police officer could legally compel you to press your finger onto your smartphone to unlock it, but if your phone was locked with a passcode, no one could legally compel you to open your phone, says William J. Cook , an attorney and partner at law firm Reed Smith in Chicago, who specializes in information technology, privacy and data security. Cook explains that the difference between a password and a biometric identifier is great under the law--you have a right not to reveal the contents of your mind, which includes things like a password, but your fingerprints are a part of who you are and you expose them to the public everyday. This is why when a person gets arrested, they have to submit their fingerprints but have a right to remain silent. Thoughts are protected, biometric identifiers (fingerprints, face or hair) are not. Ever since Apple introduced Touch ID in 2013, privacy law experts have been sounding the alarm about the way biometrics can whittle away at your right against self-incrimination. \"The Fifth Amendment protects individuals against saying anything, testimony or statements, that could incriminate themselves,\" says Paul Bond , who is also a partner at Reed", "Meet the happiest #dog in the world!

It depends on how you define \"sleep,\" but trees do relax their branches at night, which might be a sign of snoozing, scientists said. In the only reported study to look at tree siestas, researchers set up lasers that measured the movements of two silver birch trees (Betula pendula) at night. One tree was in Finland and the other in Austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in September. This was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal. [What Is the Oldest Tree in the World?] The laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second. This provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said. The silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found. Trees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants' branches drooping at night.

Hot dogs are probably the most popular fast-food ever, as they have over 7 billion consumers in the world. However, according to recent research, this fast-food is also the leading cause for four types of cancer.Hot dogs were introduced by German immigrants in the 19th century and gained their popularity quickly. These days, the hot dog enjoys an iconic status. The WHO (World Health Organization) recently issues a report that suggests all processed meals can cause cancer, including red meat. The hot dogs are made of pork, beef and chicken. Factories often use leftovers from cutting steaks and pork chops as well as edible slaughter by-products such as animal feet or head, fatty tissue and skins.During the process, these ingredients are mixed together, and additives such as sat, corn syrup, nitrates, large amount of salt and chemicals are added. Most of these added ingredients have been continuously linked to cancer. Nitrosamines have been linked to bladder cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer.Data from the American Institute for Cancer Research shows that people who consume a single corn dog daily have a 21% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. Even the organic hot dogs contain nitrites in even higher amounts", "There's a Reason Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Avoids Bikinis at All Costs.

The Obama Administration has turned down a request by two Democratic governors to change the way marijuana is classified under federal drug control laws. So for the time being, marijuana will continue to be designated a Schedule 1 drug, giving it equal status to LSD and heroin. The DEA said its decision was rooted in science, and that it\u2019s honoring the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s admonition that marijuana has \"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\" The agency added that weed has the potential for \"severe psychological or physical dependence.\" \"This decision isn\u2019t based on danger,\" noted DEA chief Chuck Rosenberg. \"This decision is based on whether marijuana, as determined by the FDA, is a safe and effective medicine, and it\u2019s not.\" It was hoped that marijuana would be granted Schedule 2 status, which would ease restrictions on research done to uncover the drug\u2019s medical value.

Studies have long shown that stress can have a lasting, negative impact on the brain. Exposure to even a few days of stress compromises the effectiveness of neurons in the hippocampus an important brain area responsible for reasoning and memory. Weeks of stress cause reversible damage to neuronal dendrites (the small arms that brain cells use to communicate with each other), and months of stress can permanently destroy neurons. Stress is a formidable threat to your success when stress gets out of control, your brain and your performance suffer. Most sources of stress at work are easy to identify. If your non-profit is working to land a grant that your organization needs to function, you're bound to feel stress and likely know how to manage it.

As expected, what was Tropical Storm Humberto became the first hurricane of the 2013 season early this morning (Sept. 11), narrowly missing out on becoming the latest-forming first hurricane in the modern record. Humberto was upgraded to a hurricane at 5 a.m. EDT today, and is currently sporting maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), just above the 74-mph threshold between tropical storms and hurricanes. The hurricane could strengthen more today before weakening on Thursday, according to the latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Humberto's transition into a hurricane occurred on the same day as Hurricane Gustav in 2002, but happened three hours earlier, according to University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy, which meant Humberto just missed out on snagging the record for latest hurricane to form in a season in the era of aircraft reconnaissance and satellites (since about 1944).

When Jovan and Attila Virag opened the back of their SUV, they smelled the familiar scent of burnt plastic and noticed that there was a hole burned into the floor and the back of their passenger seat was melted. They sifted through the contents in their backseat, but there was nothing that could have started a fire except for their 2-year-old son\u2019s light-up shoes.

Before being cast as Harry Potter at the tender age of 11, Daniel Radcliffe had never really starred in a big-budget feature film before and so no doubt it must have been a pretty nerve-wracking experience, especially since the rest of the cast was filled with such British acting icons as Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Robbie Coltrane. If we were Daniel, we'd have found it pretty daunting to work with some of those big names too. And over the years Daniel just worked with more and more of them, starring alongside Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, Helena Bonham-Carter, and David Thewlis. But speaking to People magazine, Daniel revealed there was one actor who struck fear into him like no other, and to be fair, we're not really surprised: \" I remember when I was 15 doing scenes with Ralph for the first time. He was even scarier than Alan (Rickman) was at first. Alan was super-intimidating to start off with as well, but then you get into it, but Ralph genuinely scared me for a few years.

Over the past week, Delta Air Lines has encountered epic travel delays after unprecedented storms forced the cancellation of thousands of flights. I travel a lot for my career, and when I'm headed somewhere, I want to get there. As a travel editor, I've run stories about people who make a profession out of getting bumped by the airlines. And yet, I've always quietly scoffed at travelers who would give up a seat on a flight in exchange for a measly voucher. Not my thing. This weekend, I profited from Delta's travel woes   big time. I made $11k (that's not a typo). Here's how I did it and why I'm not such a snob about getting bumped any more. On Friday morning, I was flying from New York City to Florida with my husband and daughter. The bad weather had passed, so I thought we had escaped the wrath. After hours of delays, Delta Airlines started offering money for volunteers to give up their tickets on our overbooked flight, which had 60 (sixty!) standby passengers hoping to get a seat.

For those who don't own cats, declawing may sound like simple nail clipping, but it's a very serious medical operation. Medically referred to as an onychectomy, declawing a cat is essentially amputation. Feline nails, unlike ours, are attached to their bones. To remove them, vets have to cut through tendon and nerves in order to fully remove the nail and bone. The human equivalent, as the Human Society of the United States describes it, is \"cutting off each finger at the last knuckle.\" The gravity of the procedure is why lobbyists are hoping to make it illegal in New York. \"It's the equivalent of taking a cigar cutter and cutting the end joint off,\" veterinarian Jennifer Conrad, who helped lobby for the cause, told a Daily Freeman reporter. Kristine Brabson, site director of GoodHousekeeping.com and devout cat lover (she has six of them), strongly opposes declawing. \"It's torture to cats. Why would Mother Nature give your cat claws, for you just to pay to rip them out?\" Most Popular Many cat owners opt for the procedure to avoid a cat's destructive behavior, particularly against their furniture.

A new study in the journal Brain Sciences shows that connections are strengthened between the right and left hemispheres of the brain during sleep, as much as 20 percent in just one night. Connections are strengthened by the formation of myelin around brain nerve fibers; myelin serves almost as a form of \"insulation,\" and is an important part of the movement of electrical impulses between cells. \"Interestingly, during a night of sleep, connections weakened within hemispheres but strengthened between hemispheres,\" study researcher Salome Kurth, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in a statement. These strengthening connections are a sign of a maturing brain, which is important to building language and impulse control skills. However, more research is needed to see how exactly sleep strengthens these connections, researchers noted. Kurth and assistant professor Monique LeBourgeois conducted electroencephalograms on eight children at ages 2, 3 and 5, to examine changes in brain activity with increasing age. They found that as the participants got older, the connections got stronger between the left and right hemispheres. Indeed, a past study in mice published in the Journal of Neuroscience also showed that sleep influences myelin production; getting sleep seems to turn on", "Blizzard Just Announced Some Big 'Overwatch' News.

Montecillo, whose parents are Filipino, was born in New York and spent 13 years living in Hong Kong. When he signed up for OkCupid in 2013, he was in Singapore but began using it more frequently when he moved to Portland, Ore., the following year. It was around then that he saw OkCupid\u2019s data on race and attraction. Compared with black, white and Latino men, Asian men receive fewer matches and messages from women on the dating site. That\u2019s not to say online dating can\u2019t work for Asian men. It just means they often find themselves making an effort to improve their chances. Montecillo ended up including his ethnicity on his profile, but he removed it after an exhausting period where he received a response about once in every eight or nine messages. He asked himself: \"Would people notice [me] if I was a large bearded white guy who likes hiking? I don\u2019t know.

A day after 49 people were killed in the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, Donald Trump seemed to imply that President Obama might have been connected, in some way, with the attack. \"Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart or he's got something else in mind,\" the presumptive Republican nominee told Fox & Friends Monday morning. Earlier in the interview, when asked why he called for Obama's resignation, Trump said, \"He doesn't get it or he gets it better than anybody understands. It's one or the other.\" Also during that interview, Trump repeated a four-word phrase that has come to define his conspiratorial campaign almost as much as his official slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\" \"There's something going on,\" Trump said. \"It's inconceivable.

What's more telling is what the bank had to say about it: \"Although market-making conditions generally improved compared with the first quarter of 2016, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution continued to operate in a challenging environment characterized by low interest rates, political uncertainty and concerns about global growth,\" the firm said. The words \"challenging environment\" are key. If things were looking positive, the firm most likely would have avoided that language. At the same time, equities trading, which is arguably as important to Goldman Sachs as fixed income, missed expectations and was down 12% year-over-year. The firm said that was driven by lower revenues in cash products and derivatives in Asia, plus securities services, which saw slightly lower revenues. \"During the quarter, the operating environment for equities was impacted by lower levels of client activity, lower market volumes, and a decline in volatility compared with", "US Army records reveal shocking information about Marcos you've never heard before! - Recently, US Army records revealed that Marcos' accounts during his time as a guerilla soldier are not only exaggerated but falsified as well - The former president was apparently arrested and jailed for illegally collecting money for a construction of an airfield in Baguio Another shocking revelation about President Ferdinand Marcos has been released as US Army records disclosed that some of his accounts as a guerilla soldier in World War II has been falsified.

A new study conducted by Oakland University psychologists Justin K. Mogilski and Lisa L.M. Welling suggests lovers who exhibit signs of narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism are less willing to let go of exes after breakups. Mogilski and Welling explored the alleged friendships of 861 exes. Along with answering questions about how they got along with their former flames post-breakups, participants filled out surveys intended to measure the prevalence of dark personality traits, like self-admiration, insensitivity and manipulation. The study discovered participants who exhibited more traits of a psychopath were also more likely to keep exes in their lives as \"friends.\" As if that weren't enough, their reasons for staying in touch weren't so much sentimental as they were pragmatic and self-serving (sexual access, established loyalty, etc.).

Former friends recounted O.J.'s rampant infidelity while married to Nicole, whose own relationship had started as an affair after O.J. -- married at the time -- spotted an 18-year-old Nicole waiting tables at a private Los Angeles club. \"He was an incorrigible womanizer,\" said Thomas McCollum III, an author who palled around with Simpson in the '80s and '90s.

Couples cited frivolous purchases, household budgeting and credit card debt as the biggest sources of friction.

After all, what could be better than a climate controlled treasure hunt? That dream extends into collectibles. From pogs to marbles to Cabbage Patch Kids, most of us tried to collect something at one point or another. For a fewm the passion kept going, until today a few folks have the kind of pop-culture artifacts that will amaze archeologists from future civilizations. For the time being, you can probably leave those shoeboxes where they lie though, because the truth is that those old prizes rarely retain much value over time.

A bill in the state House of Representatives would legalize the possession and use of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for people suffering from a range of medical conditions including cancer, Tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder or any other medical condition approved by the state Commissioner of Health. Patients would first need to obtain an ID card by getting written certification from a doctor, says measure HF 1818, which was introduced by Rep. Carly Melin (D-Hibbing) last spring. There's evidence that state politicians are open to passing such a bill. A similar effort was approved by the Minnesota House and Senate in 2009 before being vetoed by then-Governor Tim Pawlenty (R). This time around, Governor Mark Dayton (D) says he'd sign the bill -- but not without the support of Minnesota law enforcement agencies. So far, not a single agency has lent its support to the bill. Their opposition, according to a report in local paper St. Cloud Times, is based on fears that marijuana's medical benefits are still unproven, that any legalization effort will increase the drug's availability to kids and that the bill is too broad in listing qualifying conditions.

The Atlanta Fed's widely followed GDPNow tracker fell to an all-time low of 0.2% for the first quarter, while economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 1%.  2. The Mexican peso climbed after the Trump administration said that, actually, it isn't going to terminate NAFTA. The peso was up by about 1.3% around 7:30 a.m. ET, but retraced some of those gains later in the day. 3. Trump went on a raging tweetstorm against Democrats over negotiations to avoid a government shutdown. \"I promise to rebuild our military and secure our border,\" the president tweeted. \"Democrats want to shut down", "This Guy Put An Ice Cream Cone In His Pocket... Seconds Later, He Was In Handcuffs. But throughout history, some really strange laws have been written into place in America... and many of them still apply today. 1. Feeding the homeless. A priest in Florida was arrested and fined $500 for bringing a homeless man a plate of food. 2. Never returning a video. A man in North Carolina was arrested for failing to return a VHS copy of Freddy Got Fingered to his local video rental store. Tom Greene, the film\u2019s star, offered to cover his legal fees. 3. Giving a wet willy. A four-year old in Connecticut was arrested for reckless endangerment and fleeing the scene after giving his mom a wet willy in a restaurant. 4. Your imagination. A student in South Carolina was arrested for writing about shooting and killing his pet dinosaur. He was charged with disorderly conduct. 5. Swearing. A woman in South Carolina was arrested for swearing at a grocery store. She was charged with disorderly content for telling her son to \"stop squishing the f*cking bread.\" 6. Selling old books. It\u2019s illegal to sell certain children\u2019s books printed before 1985 for fear that they might contain traces of lead. 7. Collecting rainwater.  In Colorado, once the rain hits", "Khloe Kardashian Reacts to Lamar Odom's Drunken Plane Incident. The reality TV star's ex was escorted off a Delta airplane on Monday night at LAX, after he reportedly vomited in the galley, booked it to the bathroom to throw up again and emerged from the facilities with vomit on his clothes. Khloe took to Twitter this morning to share her disappointment, posting a simple frowning emoji. She then started replying to her followers who were tweeting messages of concern and support ... and, at one point, even lashed out. When one fan wrote, \"You're doing what you can, unfortunately he makes his own choices. Stay strong,\" Kardashian replied with, \"love you lots. Thank you.\" \"You can't save every soul,\" wrote another. Khloe's response: \"But we like to try.\" \"You can only do so much Khloe just pray,\" another added, to which she replied, \"amen.' After another follower said \"it's out of your hands,\" she told them to \"just pray.\" Things got a little heated in another exchange, when someone tweeted at her writing, \"instead of running the streets with Mr.!steal your girl [Trey Songz] you need to be helping your HUSBAND.\" \"Stay in your f--king lane little girl,\" Kardashian shot back. \"You know nothing about anything. You're a sheep herded", "Why you should never make your bed. People often tell you to make your bed because it \u2018starts the day off well\u2019 or that it brings order and calm. But the lazy among us have always known making your bed is a bad idea. For starters, it\u2019s difficult to see the point of arranging all your throw pillows and stuffed animals on the bed if you\u2019re only going to push them off hours later. If you have to leave the house early in the morning you\u2019re probably all bleary-eyed and you don\u2019t have the time or desire for tackling chores. Even if you thought about making your bed, as soon as someone nags you to do it, that immediately makes you not want to do it. It\u2019s all very complicated. Plus, it\u2019s harder to get comfortable in your bed if it\u2019s been made and the sheets are firmly tucked in. (I like to create a cocoon out of blankets and fold all the sheets up around my legs, to the point where it\u2019s stupidly warm, which is why bed-making is not for me.) Another thing to consider: if you make your bed in the morning, that means you\u2019re telling yourself that you won\u2019t be getting back into it", "\"Goldilocks zone\" study yields surprising result. A new study, unveiled today (Dec. 11), expands the habitable zone \u2014 the sweet spot in a solar system where liquid water and therefore life could potentially exist \u2014 surrounding stars like the sun. Previous studies on the habitability zone around sunlike stars have placed the innermost edge of so-called Goldilocks zone at about 0.99 AU (1 AU, or astronomical unit, is the average distance from Earth to the sun, about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers). But a new computer model study pushes that border closer to its parent star, to a distance of about 0.95 AU (about 88 million miles, or 142 million kilometers). [9 Exoplanets That Could Host Alien Life] The study in the journal Nature, led by Jeremy Leconte, now a postdoc at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics of the University of Toronto, used 3D computer modeling to find that the runaway greenhouse effect isn't an issue unless the planet is less than 0.95 AU from its star. The new inner boundary for habitable zones might not make a big difference for scientists trying to determine if an alien planet is habitable, but it does make a big difference for future life on Earth, Leconte", "Why do rivers curve? In states like Nevada, Washington and Vermont, a river\u2019s course is determined by the mountainous structures surrounding it. Like MinuteEarth mentions, these rivers \"are literally set it stone.\" But, in states like Indiana and the Great Plains, river banks made of soft soil can easily shift and change a river\u2019s course. According to MinuteEarth, all it takes is a little disturbance and a lot of time. It's a good thing nature has plenty of both.  If one bank of a river is disturbed and begins to crumble, water fills the hole and sweeps away loose dirt. Over time, this creates a bigger and bigger hole in the river bank. As the water begins to rush faster through the new opening, it slows on the opposite river bank. Because slow-moving water can\u2019t carry as much weight as fast-moving water, loose dirt and rocks build up on that side, making it more shallow. Eventually, the build-up creates new land and a new curve in the river\u2019s watercourse. The new curve causes the water running against the outside bank to pick up enough momentum that it slams into the opposite bank further down the river, creating another curve. As more time passes, the", "This News Just Ruined Swimming FOREVER. Unfortunately, a new Centers for Disease Control Unfortunately, a new Centers for Disease Control review of more than 84,000 inspections performed on 48,632 public swimming facilities (including pools, hot tubs, water parks, etc.) in Arizona, California, Florida, New York, and Texas, suggests you might need more than hope. Nearly 80 percent of inspections uncovered at least one health violation, namely involving the pool's safety equipment (which can increase the risk of drowning), pH levels (which can trigger skin and eye irritation), or disinfectant concentrations (which can increase your risk of picking up a pool-borne infection). In 12 percent of cases, these issues were horrifying enough to warrant closing the pool. While researchers didn't look at a nationally representative sample of pools (and of course your hometown's public pools are cleaner and safer than the ones tested here! \ud83d\ude4f ), you can always take matters into your own hands by my town pool, OK?!
