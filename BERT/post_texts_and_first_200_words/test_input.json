["What Happens When You Get a Perfect Score on Pac-Man Will Blow Your Mind. Billy Mitchell takes video games very seriously. He\u2019s been called one of the greatest arcade gamers ever, and there\u2019s even a documentary about his insane high score in Donkey Kong called The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. Even with his own full-length documentary film, Mitchell is still best-known for one thing: He was the first person to get a perfect score (3,333,360 points) in Pac-Man. Mitchell set the record in 1999, almost two decades after the game was originally released. \"You start off on the first board, and on board 21, that\u2019s where it reaches the maximum difficulty,\" Mitchell said in a recent interview about the achievement. \"You have to navigate all the way to board 255 doing the same repetitive thing. You can\u2019t miss a dot, a prize, a blue man. You can\u2019t die once.\" In the video, Mitchell explains how, at level 256, there\u2019s only enough memory in the game for the left-half of the board. The right-half of the game is filled with computer garble that looks something like the Matrix code. \"You get to the end, and there\u2019s nothing to do but die.\"", "The 10 Professions With the Most Psychopaths. But, sad to say, those steps are unlikely to be enough. Psychology tells us that psychopaths actually walk among us everyday. Research suggests something like 5 percent of people show psychopathic tendencies These folks aren't necessarily committing crimes, but this small but significant portion of the population does display some essential traits of psychopathy, like lack of empathy, selfishness, lack of guilt, and plenty of charm . And while it's true that there's really nothing you can do to ensure that you never have to deal with everyday psychopaths, apparently there is at least one way you could decrease your chances--you could avoid going into certain professions. According to a fascinating (if not exactly easily actionable) recent PsyBlog post, psychopaths aren't evenly scattered through the population . According to research done by psychologist Kevin Dutton called the Great British Psychopath Survey, some jobs seem to attract them and have higher than average numbers of psychopaths among their practitioners. And sorry, business leaders, you're not going to like which gig tops the list: CEO Lawyer Media (TV and radio) Salesperson Surgeon Journalist Police officer Clergyperson Chef Civil servant Some of these are more surprising than others. Who would have guessed the clergy", "You Won't Believe How Much It Would Cost to Make an Actual House Out of supreme bricks. The logic behind the Reddit user's final tally, in his words: \"I calculated how many bricks it'd take to build a 2400 square foot home, which is 117600 bricks. I then just took the cost of the Supreme brick, I made it 40$ to include the shipping and such. So, 117600 x 40 = 4,704,000.\" There are some holes in dude's math, though. First off, it'd be surprising if Supreme made more than 15,000 of these bricks in the first place. There's also a discussion on the price of the bricks, with some saying you wouldn't be paying shipping charges per brick, which would change the overall price. Either way, as one commenter noted , that's just for the bare house. One cold, non-WiFi-having, non-floor having abode. They then brought up an interesting point: \"I wonder if the resell price for bricks would affect the Supreme brick housing market. I mean you'd figure that a brick could very well go for like 60-70 resale if it's extremely hyped. That would make your house worth a little over $7 mil at $60 per brick. This might be a good business investment.\" What rich hypebeast is ready to see if Supreme would take", "This is what happens when you have $100,000 to shoot a music video but the star never shows up. Pomp&Clout director Ryan Staake faced this dilemma on a shoot for rapper Young Thug's song \"Wyclef Jean.\" But, Young Thug never actually stepped foot on set. Rather than scrape together footage to create a makeshift video, Staake cleverly turned the whole situation on its head\u2014and the result is a highly entertaining, meta-masterpiece of a music video. The video starts with a conversation about the vision for the project, but it's quickly explained with interjected typed sentences, drawings and captions all describing how things went awry. Police presence on the shoot, changes in creative direction or behind-the-scenes glimpses at post-production edits are spelled out in the video\u2014all to the tune of Thug's \"Wyclef Jean.\" Fans appropriately freaked out on Twitter about the unexpected music video and disbelief that it actually was approved and released. Young Thug Wyclef Jean video is art. Director is a genius. \u2014 h (@halsey) January 17, 2017 Young Thug's Wyclef Jean music video is a masterpiece.

Check out the details on the lawsuit:  via TMZ: 'Arsenio Hall just clapped back at Sinead O'Connor with a $5 MILLION defamation lawsuit over her claim he was fueling Prince's habit. His lawyers, Marty Singer and Lynda Goldman, filed the suit Thursday morning, in which Arsenio calls Sinead a \"desperate attention-seeker\" for posting an incendiary rant on Facebook earlier this week. She called Prince a \"longtime hard drug user\" who got his supply from \"Arsenio Hall (AKA Prince's and Eddie Murphy's bitch).\" In the suit, Arsenio flat out denies ever supplying Prince with illegal drugs -- and adds, he hasn't had contact with Sinead for 25 years. He also denies spiking her with drugs back in the day ... as she claimed. As for why she targeted him -- Arsenio says she's repeatedly", "You'll Be Stunned By What Candace Cameron Does on Fuller House. Of all the things viewers notice while binge-watching Fuller House this weekend, perhaps the one they'll least expect is this: Candace Cameron Bure (who is totally hilarious while reprising her role as D.J. Tanner) is great at the physical stunts. The show gets surprisingly physical in multiple episodes thanks to both choreographed dances and intense wrestling matches, and Bure did all the stunts herself, regardless of the fact that there was a professional stunt double on hand. \"That is me, every single move,\" Bure tells E!'s Kristin Dos Santos in the video above of a scene involving Mexican wrestling. \"They hired a stunt-woman, and they said, 'Don't worry, just watch her and we'll just kind of do close-ups of your face, she's going to do everything.' And when I watched her run through the routine the first time, I went, 'She's not doing it, I'm doing the whole thing!'\" Bure's Fuller House costars could do nothing but praise Cameron Bure's ass-kicking skills. \"It was amazing,\" Andrea Barber says. \"The reactions you see in the audience are genuine.\" The Mexican wrestling scene in particular even inspired Jodie Sweetin's Christmas present to Cameron Bure, which we are now definitely going to need proof", "This herb could be the secret to curbing cows\u2019 climate-changing burps. Oregano\u2019s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow\u2019s rumen. Danish researchers who are investigating oregano\u2019s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows\u2019 methane emissions by a quarter. Nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle. NPR points out that oregano oil isn\u2019t the only solution to cutting down cows\u2019 ballooning emissions. Scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical. But those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows\u2019 methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk. We could just eat less dairy and beef. But while some Americans are starting to shift away from meat, that change may not happen soon enough. It might behoove us to get our cows chewing oregano cud, since that could be one small solution we could implement fast.", "Sharon Stone Never Expected To Get This Disease.

Pamela Anderson shared in 2002 that she had contracted Hepatitis C, an infectious disease that affects the liver, from ex-husband and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Tommy Lee. In 2011 and 2013, Catherine Zeta-Jones checked herself into Silver Hill Hospital to receive treatment for Bipolar II Disorder. She has been openly public about her battle with the psychiatric disorder in an effort to rid the disease of its social stigma. The actress who plays Haley on Modern Family was forced to undergo a kidney transplant in 2012 due to her battle with kidney dysplasia, also known as multicystic dysplastic kidney. The condition causes cysts to form on the kidney. The 35-year-old model and reality TV personality suffers from the autoimmune disease psoriasis, which causes red, itchy and scaly skin patches. Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks went public with his Type 2 diabetes diagnosis in 2013. His doctors believe the severe weight fluctuations from his acting career may have played a role in causing him to develop the disease.

They say if you don\u2019t do X, you won\u2019t get Y. But how does it play out in real life? Let\u2019s look at things from the perspective of the person who has the budget to hire. Recently, I went to hire three health writers. In my search for candidates, I thought it would be best to look in a place where health writers already existed. I picked a website called Everyday Health (Alexa rank: 2,831) as a good place to check out. The Job I looked at it like this: Everyday Health is a recognized site that covers health topics. They do research on their content. The stories are very consumer friendly. That hit requirement No. 1 for me, that they were vetted as an expert in their area. The second thing I was looking for was someone whom I could contact by email, so I could document our conversation and get a proposal from them. With that second criterion in mind, I wanted to see what writers contributed to the publication. Luckily, they place all their writers on the same page.

That's what Russian activist Katya Romanovskaya thought after she awoke last week to find a giant wooden penis chained to her car. Yes, you read that right: She found a some 200-pound phallic structure carved out of wood atop her BMW. The outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin shared a photo of the wooden penis on Facebook, commenting that her work was finally recognized. (Story continues below) Romanovskaya made headlines last year after it was revealed that she was one of two people behind Russian satire account @KermlinRussia. Along with Arseny Bobrovsky, Romanovskaya often posts pithy quips about the failures of the Russian government in the style of Stephen Colbert or Jon Stewart. Now it seems some pranksters -- perhaps supporters of Vladimir Putin -- have tracked down Romanovskaya and left her a present. The New Republic, which first reported the special delivery, writes: This is the kind of cockamamie (sorry) prank that reeks (sorry) of Nashi, the pro-Kremlin youth group founded after Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2005.

A sociologist credited with predicting the fall of the Soviet Union has warned that US global power is in a phase of accelerated decline under the leadership of Donald Trump \u2014 and will collapse while the property mogul is the White House. Norwegian professor Johan Galtung is known as the \"founding father\" of peace studies as a scientific subject and is recognised for correctly predicting numerous historical events, among them the Tiananmen Square uprising in China and the September 11 attacks. He attracted controversy in 2000 when he predicted US global power would collapse by 2025. But under the Bush administration he revised his forecast for the collapse to 2020. Now, he says that reality that is materialising following election of the bombastic billionaire.

Yevette took to Facebook later that day and posted, \"Today at my son Elijah\u2019s school, as I was dropping him off I asked him why there were so many cars. He said [it was] Donuts with Dad, so we quickly went back home cause I wasn\u2019t about to let him miss out.\" \"I know seeing other dads with their kids isn\u2019t easy for mine,\" she continued. She pragmatically added, \"But it\u2019s life, at least I can do whatever it takes to put a smile on that face.\" Yevette also shared pictures of her and her son with his friends at school. Of course, the pictures quickly went viral, not only among single parents in a show of solidarity, but also with dual parents lending their support. The story that the casually snapped selfie outside of the school does not tell, however, is that the mustachioed Yevette was filled with nerves. But seeing the beaming smile across her son\u2019s face reminded her of why she was doing what she was doing. After all, she didn\u2019t want to see Elijah miss out on anything just because her kid\u2019s dad isn\u2019t a part of their lives. So, with the pull of donuts apparently too", "What makes a voice attractive? New study yields surprising answer. Previous studies showed that men tend to prefer women with high-pitched voices, which are associated with high levels of estrogen. And women? They tend to prefer men with deep voices, which are linked with more testosterone. But new research suggests that we're also attracted to voices that are similar to our own -- because the similarity makes us feel that we're part of a certain social group. \"The voice is an amazingly flexible tool that we use to construct our identity,\" Dr. Molly Babel, a linguistics professor at the University of British Columbia in Canada and the lead author of the new study, said in a written statement. \"Very few things in our voices are immutable, so we felt that our preferences had to be about more than a person\u2019s shape and size.\" For the new study, Babel and her colleagues asked college-aged men and women in California to rate the attractiveness of 60 different voices (30 male, 30 female) belonging to people living west of the Mississippi River.

Dopps has invented Mensez, an adhesive \"lipstick\" that is applied to a woman\u2019s lady parts to block their menstruation. And it comes undone when the woman urinates. Yes, this man was clearly not at school when his class was taught about the female anatomy. In a post on Facebook, Mensez claims: Have you ever woke up with your lips stuck together? It didn\u2019t hurt and it was kinda fun. All you had to do was to wet your lips from the inside with saliva and they became unstuck. This is the principle behind Mensez. Mensez is a natural combination of amino acids and oil in a lipstick applicator that is applied to the lips downunder during the period. It causes them to stick together, strong enough to prevent leakage, that is until the user urinates. The urine instantly unsticks the labia and allows everything to wash out into the toilet. 'Simply wipe, and reapply,' it advises. In an even more bizarre turn of events, his product is patented.

When Donald Trump went on \"Fox and Friends\" on Monday morning, he shared some strange news: Two of his children, Ivanka and Eric, won't be able to vote for him in New York's April 19 Republican primary. Wait, really? How did that happen? In the most basic terms, they missed the registration deadline. But while the three Trumps have spent the week saying they \"didn't register to vote\" in time, it's actually a little bit more complicated than that. Ivanka has said several times that she's a registered independent, because she prefers to vote for individual candidates over broader party platforms. Her brother Eric has also indicated he's registered as an independent. The problem for them is that New York has very restrictive laws around switching one's party affiliation. While new voters were permitted to register up until March 25 \u2013 less than a month before the primary \u2013 the deadline for switching party affiliations was way back on October 9 of last year.

The Sonoma Marsh Restoration Project is a 20-year-long endeavor by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the California Coastal Conservancy and the California Department of Fish and Game to revitalize a nearly 10,000-acre network of wetlands and connected habitats. According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state purchased the land in 1994 from Cargill Salt Co., which had used the area as artificial salt ponds, driving out the natural habitants not suited to the water's highly saline conditions.

But for many drivers, going green wasn't the only reason to choose electric. According to research by auto data firm TrueCar.com, many electric vehicle buyers were attracted by the deals being offered by such manufacturers as Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Honda as they try to build momentum in the category. The Ford Focus offers a bit of insight into the divide between traditional and electric car owners. A typical buyer of the model's conventional, gasoline-powered vehicle is 46 years old and has a household income of $77,000. The Focus Electric, however, is typically purchased by a 43-year-old with a household income of $199,000. That pattern repeats itself across the industry, according to TrueCar. Buyers of the electric Fiat 500e average 45 years of age and have a household income of $145,000. That\u2019s twice the money of a conventional Fiat 500 buyers\u2014and two years younger, on average. For the U.S. auto industry on the whole, the typical buyer is 52 years old with an $86,000 household income, Krafcik said. Based on the manufacturer suggested retail price, battery-based vehicles typically cost more than comparable gas models.

Seltzer is water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide added to give it bubbles. Sparkling water is the umbrella term for carbonated water, including naturally carbonated sparkling mineral water and artificially carbonated seltzer and club soda. Studies have not shown ill health effects from drinking seltzer or other plain sparkling waters. 2006 study found an association between drinking colas and low bone mineral density. But the association was not seen in those who drank other carbonated beverages. Colas, with their low pH (a measure of acidity), also have the potential to erode tooth enamel. But a study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that the pH of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel. Carbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said Dr. John Ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, who co-authored the paper. \"It\u2019s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that\u2019s in your classic soft drinks that the pH can drop below the critical pH of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Science and Security Board, in conjunction with the Board of Sponsors, which includes 16 Nobel Laureates, announced their annual decision on the clock's setting Tuesday afternoon, and said it would stay the same as last year. They said they based their decision on the global threat of climate change, as well as continued nuclear tensions between the U.S. and Russia and between Pakistan and India, and the recent claim by North Korea of testing a hydrogen bomb. Lawrence Krauss, chair of the Board of Sponsors and a renowned physicist and professor at Arizona State University, said that the decision to not move the clock is a sign of the troubles facing humanity. \"It is of grave concern that the situation remains largely the same,\" he told reporters. Despite the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by nearly 200 nations that agreed to reduce carbon emissions, Krauss said that \"the fight against climate change has barely begun.\" In order to improve the situation so the clock can be moved back, the Bulletin calls on the citizens of the world to implore leaders to reduce nuclear modernization programs, engage North Korea to reduce nuclear risks, follow up", "How to Prevent Asthma Attacks the Natural Way.

Distressed by what it showed, she said, \"That\u2019s not me. I would never do something like that.\" But in the grip of her addiction, she did. Jon Adams said he started recording after someone called 911 to get the woman help. \"People need to see. They need to see what happens,\" Adams said in the video.

Luckily, no one was hurt, but Henry knows it could have been much, much worse. \"I can\u2019t bring myself to think about it,\" Katrina told WDJT. \"I do, and I hate myself so much.\" In the video, three paramedics surrounded Henry as she was lying lifeless on the pavement.

Douglas is only 20 years old, but she's already got a huge (and growing) fan club. The world-famous toy company, Mattel, just proved that it's a big fan of Douglas, too. Mattel was founded by a strong, go-getting woman, and the company has always made inspiring young girls to follow their dreams one of its biggest priorities. To that end, the company designed a series of dolls, called \"Shero\" dolls, to spotlight extraordinary, pioneering women. It has made dolls of ballet dancer Misty Copeland, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, and actress Emmy Rossum, according to the Huffington Post. Douglas will join this motley crew with her own, lifelike \"Shero\" doll.  Douglas seems pretty thrilled about the development (who wouldn't be?). She took to Twitter on Monday morning to announce the news. She wrote, \"Excited to debut my @Barbie Shero doll! Let\u2019s continue to break barriers & dream big, girls!\" In the photo she posted, Douglas is at the gym with her Shero doll.

So, as Lauri Vuohensilta \u2013 the mad genius behind the channel \u2013 says in the video: \"They say diamonds are forever, but how long?\" As it turns out, not very long. So, how was the diamond broken so easily? As some have pointed out, the \"hardness\" that diamonds are known for only really refers to their ability to be scratch-resistant. While the covalent bonds between the diamond atoms themselves are extremely strong, diamonds can also be brittle, especially if there\u2019s any kind of defect or it\u2019s been poorly cut. Scientists have even discovered materials that are actually harder than diamonds, such as wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite.

The conclusion of Star Wars: The Force Awakens left us all with one question: Who are Rey\u2019s parents? While many people believed the final shot was a clue to Rey being a Skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a Kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series. But a new theory has awakened: that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine\u2019s granddaughter. YouTuber Vincent Vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it\u2019s pretty compelling. There\u2019s the matter of their fighting styles. Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move. This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust. Rey\u2019s first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine\u2019s fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental. This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey\u2019s parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides.

In recent years, wild caught and farm raised has become a distinction between various types of fish found in the grocery store, but can most frequently be seen attached to salmon. The average American consumes two pounds of salmon a year, around two-thirds of which comes from farmed sources in China, Norway, and Canada. While wild-caught is largely self-explanatory, what exactly does farm raised mean in the context of fish, mainly salmon? Floating Pig Farms Around 40 percent of all fish consumed annually, are raised on aquafarms which can either be land-based or ocean-based. Land-based farms raise thousands of fish in ponds, pools or even concrete tanks, where ocean-based aquafarms house fish in isolated cages either off-shore or in the open water. In both cases, fish are overstocked and have little space to swim or display their natural behaviors, creating an extremely stressful environment. Around 40 percent of aquafarmed fish will die before they are harvested. And with good reason. Stocking thousands of fish in a small amount of space and feeding them protein pellets (ironically made from other fish) doused with antibiotics and chemicals, such as PCB, understandably makes for highly polluted water.

Less than one in 10 high school students needed surgery for their injuries, and almost half returned to play within a week of their injury. This study, led by T. Walker Robinson, MD, MPH, of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, investigated shoulder injuries among US high school athletes. The researchers collected data about nine sports from a group of 100 nationally representative high schools for the school years ranging from 2005-2006 through 2011-2012. The sports included boys' football, soccer, basketball, wrestling and baseball, as well as girls' soccer, volleyball, basketball and softball. The researchers looked at the rate of shoulder injuries among the total number of \"athletic exposures,\" defined as a single athlete participating in a single practice or game. To qualify as a shoulder injury, it had to occur as a result of the sport, require attention by a trainer or doctor and either be a fracture and/or result in the athlete having to sit out at least one day", "WATCH: Manhunt underway for escaped prisoner.

Mats Linander 2015-03-19 - New York Betteridge\u2019s law of headlines famously asserts that any headline that end in a question mark can be answered by the word \"no\". This \"law\" is of course no law \u2013 creating a counter-example is trivial \u2013 but should rather be seen as a tongue-in-cheek remark on how poor journalism sometimes hides behind dubious headlines. In this post we\u2019ll try to answer to what extent Betteridge\u2019s law applies to current articles on the internet. Using the scripts in this repository , we have crawled 13 separate news sites for a total of 26000 headlines (2000 per site) and tried to answer the 766 of them that end in question mark. Headline polarity A polar question is a question for which the expected answer is either \"yes\" or \"no\". We find plenty of these among our 766 headlines, but also plenty of non-polar questions. Roughly 46% of the 766 headlines ending in question mark are non-polar. They are not yes-no questions, so the answer can\u2019t be \"no\". As such, they contradict Betteridge\u2019s law. Yes and no but also maybe Even though Betteridge\u2019s law clearly doesn\u2019t hold for all headlines, could it be that the remaining 54% all", "Why I Won't Buy One Extra Box Of Kleenex For My Kid's School Supplies.

Fans were excited to see Mercado\u2019s take on the role given her acting reputation. Fans were excited for Mercado\u2019s next project on TV. The remake of the fantasy-drama from 2014 was highly anticipated given its fresh plot and top ratings not only in Korea but in other countries as well. In the story, an alien who landed on Earth during the Joseon Dynasty in Korea lived up to 400 more years to meet the love of his life in the character of Mercado, a top actress in the modern era. In line with Steffi\u2019s character, the director was asked if the training of the actress with Jonas Gaffud", "Supergirl Added To Lego Dimensions In The Worst Way. One of my favorite things about Lego Dimensions up until this point was a distinct lack of platform-specific content. While Disney Infinity had retailer exclusive variants and Skylanders did the whole Wii/Wii U/3DS Nintendo crossover thing, Lego Dimensions was all out there, save for the odd convention circuit exclusive (I will have you, Green Arrow.) Starting late in September, Supergirl will come bundled alongside Batman, Wyldstyle and Gandalf in the PlayStation 4 Starter Pack for Lego Dimensions . What this means, is that if you already own a Starter Pack (which ran $99 at launch but have slipped down to around $60 or less lately), you\u2019ll have to buy another one for Supergirl. Supergirl packs all the powers of Superman\u2014flying, super strength,x-ray vision and eye-beams, and is also able to transform into Red Lantern Supergirl, adding rage bolts and constructs to her repertoire.

For the two metropolises whose bids fall short, stunned disappointment will surely descend, as city leaders bemoan a lost economic opportunity. Yet this inevitable reaction fails to account for a little-understood reality of the Olympics as catalyst for urban development: In seeking to host the games, coming in second tends to work out better, say economists who have studied this phenomenon. The runner-up tends to invest in the same sort of infrastructure aimed at impressing the Olympic committee, such as roadway improvements and modern signage, which assist in spurring trade and commerce. But the No. 2 choice then gets spared the expense and hassle of actually hosting the games. The result is a surge of productive investment in the early stages, and an avoidance of the sort of white elephant construction projects that get built right before the games commence. \"There is no way that it\u2019s in your national interest to host the games, but it may be in your interest to bid for the games,\" said Andrew Rose, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-wrote a 2009 paper on the economic benefits of hosting the Olympics.

Facebook has just added a new feature, which is startlingly similar to one found on rival platform Snapchat, that allows you to find out. The company said that they will never permit features that allow other users to see who viewed their profile, which happens in networks like LinkedIn. However, the new 'Stories' feature on the Facebook app allows you to see who has viewed your stories and specifically which parts of it. Much like Snapchat lets you know when people view your stories. Or like Facebook-owned Instagram, which introduced the feature after it saw the success on Snapchat. Or like Facebook Messenger.

And while Snapchat has the cachet of being the originator of the Stories format, the closed nature of its platform means that it lacks the same network effects as Instagram. If Snapchat wants to succeed against Instagram in the long-run \u2013 in both the domain of ephemeral sharing and more broadly in social media \u2013 then it might need to take a leaf from its rival's Instagram page and emulate the open-nature of its network. Network effects cause a product's value to compound as more users buy in. Every successful social platform (including Snapchat) owes its prosperity to network effects. As more users sign up, there are more people to connect with and more content to interact with. This increases the benefits of being the platform, which keeps existing users on platform and attracts new sign ups. On the other hand, flailing social networks fall short because \"they never caught on\" and hit critical mass, while extinct social networks die out when no one uses their platform anymore. The openness of Instagram's platform and its superior user base give it a key advantage over Snapchat. Instagram counts over 300 million daily active users (DAUs), almost double that of Snapchat.

According to KLTV, a city spokesman said Nugent was \"not the right feel for this kind of community event.\" The city had reached a verbal agreement with Nugent, scheduling the rocker as the headliner who would play inside the Maude Cobb Convention and Activity Center during the town's Independence Day celebration. To break that agreement, the town paid Nugent half of his guaranteed performance fee of $32,000 from Maude Cobb's annual budget. The move comes amid criticism of comments Nugent made about President Barack Obama in January 2014, calling him a \"subhuman mongrel.\" Nugent, who campaigned with Texas Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott amid the controversy, apologized for those comments in February. Abbott said he was moving on from the controversy over Nugent in late February, but his ties to the rocker remain a prominent talking point of both sides of the governor's race.

Narcissists genuinely believe they are unique and entitled to special treatment, and they have a chronic need for admiration and validation \u2014 at any cost. \"Most of us grow out of thinking we are Superman at 6 years old,\" says Durvasula. \"We shouldn\u2019t be running around like that at 41.\" Children don\u2019t offer the type of continuous positive feedback narcissists crave, and narcissistic parents tend to react in one of two ways.

The plan, approved by a 6-1 vote, was the hybrid of a detailed resolution by east San Fernando Valley board member Monica Ratliff and a request by Superintendent John Deasy to take the next step in eventually equipping all 600,000 students with some type of device. In the end, it was Deasy himself who merged his plan with Ratliff's and addressed the various board members' visions and concerns about the troubled first phase of the rollout and where the district should go from here. \"I was glad I was able to reach a compromise with board member Ratliff and continue to advance the opportunities for students,\" Deasy said after the 21/2-hour discussion. Ratliff's proposal addressed security breaches and other issues raised by schools participating in the first phase, which got under way this fall at 47 schools. She wanted to get all of the problems worked out and a detailed analysis made before proceeding with Phase 2 -- a process she estimated would take until next summer. She also wanted to buy laptops -- not iPads -- for some high schools to determine whether those devices would better fit the instructional needs of those students. But Deasy persuaded her and the", ".@Buzzfeed headline: This government got total access to your private life and you'll never guess what happened next. Criminal-history and driver databases give officers critical information about people they encounter on the job. But the AP's review shows how those systems also can be exploited by officers who, motivated by romantic quarrels, personal conflicts or voyeuristic curiosity, sidestep policies and sometimes the law by snooping. In the most egregious cases, officers have used information to stalk or harass, or have tampered with or sold records they obtained. No single agency tracks how often the abuse happens nationwide, and record-keeping inconsistencies make it impossible to know how many violations occur. But the AP, through records requests to state agencies and big-city police departments, found law enforcement officers and employees who misused databases were fired, suspended or resigned more than 325 times between 2013 and 2015. They received reprimands, counseling or lesser discipline in more than 250 instances, the review found. Unspecified discipline was imposed in more than 90 instances reviewed by AP. In many other cases, it wasn't clear from the records if punishment was given at all. The number of violations was surely far higher since records provided were spotty at best, and many cases go unnoticed. Among those punished: an Ohio officer who pleaded guilty to stalking an", "Here are the biggest names that have been let go by ESPN in its latest round of layoffs.

E-commerce retailers like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Google Shopping, and Overstock have joined in banning the images of the flag. Prior to banning products with the flag, Amazon's sales of the controversial symbol were skyrocketing. Even Apple removed games in the app stores with the flag. Governor Nikki Haley said it was \"time to from the [Confederate] flag from the Capitol grounds\" after the horrifying shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. She said the suspected Charleston shooter viewed the flag in a \"sick and twisted\" way. A controversy has stirred the nation over whether it is or isn't appropriate to sell the Confederate flag. People who support the flag say it is an important part of American history. But major retailers are worried about image, and making profits from the flags isn't worth the consequence of being perceived as racist, Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates Inc., a retail consulting agency and investment banking firm based in New York, told Business Insider \"This is no longer acceptable,\" Davidowitz said. \"And it went from being acceptable to no longer being acceptable pretty quick [so now] everybody is bailing out on it... no one wants to be seen as a racist", "Look who just launched a new free streaming-music service:. Users will be able to listen to curated radio stations based on genre, mood, decade or activity. They can also search stations by artist, album or song to find stations that play similar music. Google's free music service comes two years after it introduced its paid version, which gives users access to more than 30 million songs for $10 per month. By creating free online radio stations, the tech giant is hoping to better compete against Spotify and Pandora, which have gained huge followings with their free music streaming services, and convert some free Google listeners into paying customers. Tuesday's premiere by Google coincides with recent tensions between streaming services and music artists. Over the weekend, Apple\u2019s upcoming paid streaming-music service faced withering criticism from pop singer Taylor Swift, who wrote a letter complaining about the company failing to pay artists royalties during a free three-month trial period. Apple quickly caved in. But it served as a big reminder about the tensions between the music streaming services and musicians, many of whom are angry about what they describe as low royalty rates. Google, with its new Internet radio, said it is paying the statutory rate to artists. As such, the company", "@CyndiLauper reveals that this hit '80s song was inspired by... gay porn.

For visual inspiration, Lauper sought out Blueboy magazine, which at the time, was a popular gay porn publication. \"There was Playgirl, but that was kinda boring,\" Lauper recalled. \"And there was, like, Blueboy, which at that time -- in my ignorance -- I thought it was a women's magazine.

Despite that, the information you have already made available may make you the recipient of targeted advertising.  Since September ProPublica collected over 52,000 unique attributes Facebook uses to classify its customers, by using data about categories of interest provided by users.   Facebook gathers information about its users from a variety of sources \u2013 openly available and collected by third parties. What isn\u2019t well known, however, is that commercial data brokers compile records about the way Facebook users behave in the real world \u2013 including favourite restaurants, frequent places visited, and interests. Every time someone adds a movie they like, or reacts to a post with one of the six options available, they are giving data brokers more information about themselves. Based on this information, data brokers can tailor ads to individuals in a much more accurate way - but the individual does not have access to the dossier about them. Steve Satterfield, a Facebook manager of privacy and public policy told ProPublica: Our approach to controls for third-party categories is somewhat different than our approach for Facebook-specific categories.

But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others. Among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry. There are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston. For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, \"eligible\" to remarry has also risen.

This burst of blue came about when scientists at Oregon State University (OSU) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200\u00b0C (2,000\u00b0F). Although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named \"YInMn blue.\" The findings of the original study were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. \"Basically, this was an accidental discovery,\" said Mas Subramanian, a Milton Harris professor of materials science in the OSU Department of Chemistry, in a statement. \"Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment.

Let's start with \"The Chronicles of Riddick,\" the sequel to \"Pitch Black,\" which was released on June 11, 2004. The film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the North American box office, making it one of that summer's costly misfires. After that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, Universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film's reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million. Maybe, though, that was for the best. In this new installment, we find Riddick (Diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. After a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for Riddick. So, Riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as \"Riddick\" director David Twohy calls him, \"the bogey man.\" It's something Twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie. Did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" underperformed? Yeah, I had my doubts after the second one. And we suffered some slings and arrows.

You can have insanely talented salespeople, and they'll still make the same mistakes over and over again if they don't have proper training. When people don't feel they're supported because they're constantly wanting for resources, they eventually burn out. But many companies fail to address these needs within their sales department, and they end up losing their top representatives because of it. Becoming Sales Intelligent Modern technology didn't create a training or resource crisis, but it did change the types of tools and training that social selling requires. Rapidly shifting sales techniques demand a proactive attitude toward salesforce development. Productivity tools have enabled salespeople to work smarter and spend more time interfacing with clients than managing mundane tasks. The flip side of this is that prospects and customers expect rapid results and constant access. Sales teams must be prepared for the 24/7 nature of their jobs. This is where sales intelligence comes in. Sales and marketing overlap more than ever before.

They tend to fall into one of five categories -- Awkward Syntax, Jarring Word Choice, Non-Sequitorial Thought Process, English Subversion or Not Quite a Rhyme in the First Place", "VW fixed the problem of dirty backup cameras with this simple technology. The car is loads of fun, has an amazing audio system, and is pretty cheap, at less than $25,000. But it also has a nifty feature that no driver is ever going to see \u2014 although he or she might hear it, and it solves a problem that every driver with a backup camera has faced when the weather gets rough. Check it out. It's an adorable little gold VW Beetle \"Dune.\" You start it up and put it in reverse and ... ... the backing camera activates and you can see behind you on the infotainment screen. Here's the back of the car. But where is the camera? Don't see one anywhere, just that famous VW badge ... ... which flips open when the car is in reverse to reveal the hidden camera! Can you spot it? There it is. Quite cool, but something the driver never sees, as the badge closes when the car isn't in reverse. You can hear it opening, however, from the driver's seat. And because the camera is almost always covered, it stays clean. Backup cameras have become ubiquitous on new cars, but they're often dirty. VW has fixed that problem!", "This Guy Keeps Getting Killed In Terrorist Attacks. If this face seems familiar, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019ve seen it associated with any number of recent terror incidents. This man has apparently died at least three times since January, most recently in the terrorist attack at Atatu\u0308rk Airport in Istanbul. So what gives? A France24 investigation provides the answer. Twitter screengrab via France24 This same guy has been identified through social media as a terror victim in the wake of several recent incidents, including the EgyptAir crash last month, the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, and the deadly attack at the Turkish airport. He\u2019s also been connected to other sorts of tragedies, including an incident in Mexico when police shot at a crowd of people protesting education reform. But instead of identifying him as a victim, social media users said he was the person who ordered the police to shoot. Twitter screengrab via France24 All these claims are, obviously, false. Regrettably, these social media shenanigans have been picked up by the media; the man\u2019s photo is currently included in a New York Times video about the victims of the Orlando shooting.

Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we\u2019re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this live thread, and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog. We\u2019ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm.

In the year that followed, authorities would call into question the convictions of tens of thousands of drug cases handled by Dookhan in the Massachusetts state drug lab. There was a reason she was so fast, it turned out: She eventually told investigators she tripled the productivity rates of her colleagues by not actually testing all the drugs that came before her, forging her co-workers\u2019 initials and mixing drug samples so that her shoddy analysis matched the results she gave prosecutors. Her motivation, according to her attorney, reflected the overachiever mentality she had exhibited throughout her life: to be \"the hardest working and most prolific and most productive chemist.\" But the full consequences of her crimes became clear only this week when prosecutors in eight Boston-area counties announced they would dismiss 21,587 drug cases tainted by Dookhan\u2019s misconduct. On Thursday, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court made those dismissals official. The American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts called it the largest dismissal of convictions in U.S. history. \"Today is a major victory for justice, fairness, and the tens of thousands of people who were wrongfully convicted based on fabricated evidence,\" ACLU executive director Carol Rose said in a statement. It appears Dookhan", "Have You Woken Up At Night And Were Unable To Move And Felt Paralyzed. It Means This. However, for some people a good night\u2019s sleep is hard to come by, or it ends up being ruined, by a strange phenomenon that is called sleep paralysis. It happens when your mind wakes up before your body ever gets a chance to. You can breathe normally, you can see and understand everything around you, but you can\u2019t move a muscle no matter how hard you try. The feelings that run through your mind when sleep paralysis occurs are overwhelming and the whole experience can be summed up as terrifying. Many people report that right before waking they hear a loud bang or waves crashing in their head which suddenly jars them awake. Others report that they do in fact have difficulty breathing and that it feels as if someone were choking them. These moments can last from a few seconds to several minutes or longer and most commonly show up initially during one\u2019s teenage years. The sensation of waking up and not being able to move is thought to affect less than 8% of the general population. There are no serious risks attributed to sleep paralysis on its own, medically speaking, rather the mental and physical damage may occur in", "Why Drivers in China Intentionally Kill the Pedestrians They Hit. It seems like a crazy urban legend: In China, drivers who have injured pedestrians will sometimes then try to kill them. And yet not only is it true, it\u2019s fairly common; security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. The Chinese language even has an adage for the phenomenon: \"It is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure.\" This 2008 television report features security camera footage of a dusty white Passat reversing at high speed and smashing into a 64-year-old grandmother. The Passat\u2019s back wheels bounce up over her head and body. The driver, Zhao Xiao Cheng, stops the car for a moment then hits the gas, causing his front wheels to roll over the woman. Then Zhao shifts into drive, wheels grinding the woman into the pavement. Zhao is not done. Twice more he shifts back and forth between drive and reverse, each time thudding over the grandmother\u2019s body. He then speeds away from her corpse. Incredibly, Zhao was found not guilty of intentional homicide. Accepting Zhao\u2019s claim that he thought he was driving over a trash bag, the court of Taizhou in Zhejiang", "This scent will make you trust people more according to science. \"Our results might have various serious implications for a broad range of situations in which interpersonal trust is an essential element,\" Leiden psychologist Roberta Sellaro said in a statement. \"Smelling the aroma of lavender may help a seller to establish more easily a trusting negotiation to sell a car, or in a grocery store it may induce consumers to spend more money buying products. The smell of lavender may also be helpful in sport psychology to enhance trust and build team spirit, for example in the case of team games such as soccer and volleyball.\" To investigate the flower's effect on trust, Leiden University researchers exposed one group of study participants to the scent of lavender and another group to peppermint. Then, the participants were asked to play a game that is commonly used in experimental settings to measure how much one subject trusts another. In the game, a \"trustor\" was given 5 Euros and instructed to decide how much of that money to give a \"trustee\" in each round. The trustee, in return, could decide to split the money with the trustor. If the trustee gave the trustor enough money in return, he or she would receive additional money.

Developed by Surrey NanoSystems, it is made up of a series of microscopic vertical tubes; and when light hits the colour, it doesn\u2019t bounce off as is the case with regular colours and instead it becomes trapped. Nearly all of the light is swallowed up - 99.6 per cent to be exact - creating the darkest substance yet known. Kapoor, who also designed the 2012 Olympics' Orbit Tower, has been working with the colour for over two years, and told The Guardian that what had attracted him to the colour was his fascination with \u2018void forms\u2019. In collaboration with NanoSystems, Kapoor has been working towards creating art with the substance, which is proving difficult because of the particular way it is manufactured: only two square centimetres can be made at a time, and both he and the scientists are hoping to manufacture the colour in bulk. But many people - both in the art community and the public at large - criticise his monopoly over the use of the colour.

It's a way to prove your allegiance and to represent the brand. Well, Tuesday's Marc by Marc Jacobs' showgoers did exactly that. More women than we can count on one hand wore looks from the designer's Fall 2013 collection.

Cats, dogs, and other mammals are thought to see in ultraviolet light, which opens up a whole different world than the one we see, the study explains. Seeing the World in Ultraviolet (UV) Light UV light is the wave length beyond the visible light from red to violet that humans can see. Humans have a lens that blocks UV from reaching the retina. It was previously thought that most mammals have lenses similar to humans. Scientists studied the lenses of dead mammals, including cats, dogs, monkeys, pandas, hedgehogs, and ferrets. By researching how much light passes through the lens to reach the retina, they concluded that some mammals previously thought not to be able to see UV actually can. \"Nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet, but in fact, they do,\" Ron Douglas, the study leader and a biologist at City University London, England, told LiveScience. What purpose does being able to see UV light serve for animals such as reindeer, rodents, and other mammals? It allows reindeer to see polar bears, for example, which are nearly invisible in regular light because they blend in with the snow. UV light also allows mammals to see urine trails. This would", "You really only need one thing to throw together a healthy dinner. 1. Rule #1: Eat Two Pounds Of Vegetables Every single day. \"Loading your diet with vegetables will naturally crowd out things you shouldn't be eating,\" says Joel Fuhrman, MD, author of Eat to Live Cookbook, who recommends this amount after analyzing studies connecting vegetable consumption with overall health. Aim for one pound raw and one pound cooked: Certain cancer-fighting compounds in some vegetables, like broccoli, cabbage, and kale, are better absorbed raw, while cooking others (carrots, sweet corn) can boost their levels of antioxidants. Though two pounds might sound like a lot, a single sweet potato can get you a quarter of the way there. \"You don't necessarily need to measure your food; just use this figure as a reminder to eat a hefty amount of veggies every day,\" Fuhrman says. \"Work in cooked greens and interesting stir-fries, and you're set.\" Rule #2: Put An Egg On It So long as you have eggs in the refrigerator, you can throw together a healthy dinner in the same amount of time you'd need to order takeout. You can top a pita with a baked (or fried) egg and some cheese (see recipe below) or add an egg to a bowl of rice,", "Guess what local fried chicken made it to an award-winning food critic\u2019s favorites! - The restaurant has built a better reputation for itself as its Glendale, California branch has been dubbed as one of the area's best Asian fried chicken joints - Award-winning food critic Johnathan Gold dubbed Max\u2019s chicken as \u2018pretty much the right call' Philippine cuisine has made its mark as one of the best cuisines in the world, whether traditional or fast food.

In the study, published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology, researchers had 8,520 women rate the physical attractiveness of men with varying degrees of facial hair, all of which were manipulated using computer graphics.

In other words, it was unanimous across the board, whether women were looking for one-night stands or potential husbands. Stubble was deemed most attractive overall and received higher ratings for flings and short-term relationships than full beards. Full beards were attractive to women searching for long-term relationships.

The likelihood that they had consumed alcohol within 30 days jumped by 16 percent, while pot use fell by 10 percent. Researchers regard the findings as essential to the debate over how to regulate the substances, how marijuana laws are enforced will ultimately affect alcohol use, and the other way around according to Ben Crost, a co-author of the study, \"If you think alcohol is much", "Why You Should Update Your iPhone Immediately. Especially if you have something to hide. Apple issued a patch Thursday to fix a dangerous security flaw in iPhones and iPads after researchers discovered that a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident\u2019s phone had been targeted with a previously unknown method of hacking. The thwarted attack on the human rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, used a text message that invited him to click on a web link. Instead of clicking, he forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab. The hack is the first known case of software that can remotely take over a fully up-to-date iPhone 6. Experts at Citizen Lab worked with security company Lookout and determined that the link would have installed a program taking advantage of a three flaws that Apple and others were not aware of. The researchers disclosed their findings Thursday. \"Once infected, Mansoor\u2019s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone\u2019s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,\" Citizen Lab wrote in a report released Thursday.

But it donated less than 2% of that money Washington (CNN) At first glance, the National Vietnam Veterans Foundation is a roaring success. According to its tax filings, the charity has received more than $29 million in donations from generous Americans from 2010 to 2014 for what it calls on its website \"aiding, supporting and benefiting America's veterans and their families.\" But look a little closer on those same filings and you can see that nearly all of those donations have been cycled back to telemarketers, leaving less than 2 percent for actual veterans and veterans' charitable causes. That's why Charity Navigator, one of the nation's largest and most influential charity watchdog organizations, has given the charity a \"zero\" out of four stars for those same four years. \"It's a zero-star organization and you can't go lower than that,\" says Michael Thatcher, Charity Navigator's CEO. \"They don't have an independent board of directors, they actually don't even have a comprehensive board of directors -- only three members on the board at this point in time and some of them are family. So one can say, is this representative of an independent board? It's not.\" The charity's most recently filed tax return,", "Long-Term Marijuana Use Has One Crazy Side Effect, New Study Says. After analyzing about 1,000 cannabis users in New Zealand, researchers found that those who smoked pot for 20 or more years had few health problems \u2014 with the exception of gum disease. Lead researcher Madeline Meier, an assistant professor of psychology at Arizona State University, said of the findings, Unlike tobacco smoking, cannabis smoking is associated with few physical health problems in midlife, with the exception of periodontal disease... Our analyses show that this association was not explained by tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse or less tooth brushing and flossing. While the study doesn\u2019t prove cannabis can cause gum disease, it does shed some light on the pros and cons that come with regular use, specifically smoking. A co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Duke University, Avshalom Caspi, said, What we\u2019re seeing is that cannabis may be harmful in some respects, but possibly not in every way. We need to recognize that heavy recreational cannabis use does have some adverse consequences, but overall damage to physical health is not apparent in this study. While smoking weed every day for multiple decades surely has some negative side effects, using alternative methods like vaporizers and edibles could potentially mitigate some of", "The Scary And Heartbreaking Reason This Mom Photographed Her 3-Year-Old.

U.S. expectancy in 2011 was 78.7 years, which is slightly below the OECD average of 80.1. For U.S. men, the average life expectancy is 76, while it's 81 for U.S. women. (At five years, this gap in life expectancy between men and women is smaller than the OECD average of six years). The U.S. life expectancy comes in just behind Slovenia, at 80.1 years, and Denmark, at 79.9 years. Comparatively, life expectancy is 81.1 years in the United Kingdom and 82.8 years in Switzerland (the country that came in first in the ranking). The Russian Federation came in last, with a life expectancy of 69.8 years. In the 1960, the U.S. average life expectancy was 1.5 years above the OECD average. While this doesn't mean that life expectancy is decreasing in the United States -- The Washington Post pointed out that life expectancy is eight years longer now than it was in 1970 -- growth in life expectancy is not as fast as in other countries. \"In the United States, life expectancy at birth increased by almost nine years between 1960 and 2011, but this is less than the increase of over 15 years in Japan and over 11 years on", "Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is facing a terrifying reality about its most loyal customers. The foreign tourists who line up at Abercrombie & Fitch are increasingly nervous about spending money \u2014 and that could hurt the brand's turnaround.

At least in Pennsylvania. The state legislature there recently extended its 6 percent sales tax to digital downloads and subscription services like Netflix and Hulu. Though it's called the Netflix tax, colloquially at least, the fee will also apply to streaming and downloads for music, e-books and apps. Digital versions of newspapers, magazines and the Bible, will be exempt. Pennsylvania joins a select group of locations that have begun to put local taxes on digital services. Chicago already has a similar 9-percent tax, often called its \"cloud tax.\" Digital goods are also taxable in Minnesota. Similar taxes have come up in Canada. Netflix even battled in Kentucky over telecommunications taxes there, a way some states have tried to tax digital services without imposing a sales tax. The sales taxes, like the one in Pennsylvania, are applied when a customer uses a billing address in a city or state with an applicable sales tax. So if you want to avoid the Netflix tax, borrow a billing address outside the state. At least until the Netflix tax comes for us all, that is. Pennsylvania is taxing netflix spotify and apple music.

But after many spectacular failed attempts the Californian rocket maker SpaceX has in the last four months landed an orbital rocket stage four times \u2013 once on land in December 2015 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and in April for the first time on a remote-controlled barge in the mid-Atlantic. And these were not dummy rockets: both were the 40-metre-high first stages of Falcon 9 rockets that had just launched commercial spacecraft into orbit. By returning rocket stages to Earth for reconditioning and reuse, SpaceX's founder, billionaire Elon Musk, hopes eventually to make spaceflight as economical as commercial aviation. His point: airlines don't throw away a Boeing 747 after every flight, so why do it with spaceships? Sci-fi has predicted reusable spacecraft for a century or more, and space engineers have experimented with the idea since the mid-20th Century \u2013 the partially reusable Space Shuttle is arguably the closest we\u2019ve got. So why has reusability taken so long to be seriously considered? First, it\u2019s worth highlighting that SpaceX is not alone.

If alcohol doesn't mess with your poops at all, consider yourself lucky. Maybe it happens while you're drinking, and you end up trapped in a bar bathroom praying for mercy. You know it's bad when you actually have to sit down on those gross toilets. ...or you spend the entire morning after on the toilet. Either way, alcohol poops are no fun. To get to the bottom of this, BuzzFeed Health reached out to two experts: Dr. Lisa Ganjhu, gastroenterologist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City, and Dr. Ali Keshavarzian, director of digestive diseases at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and grantee of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). So, here's why booze can be a literal shitshow sometimes: First, let's go over how alcohol is actually processed through your digestive system. When alcohol hits the stomach, a little bit is absorbed through the stomach lining. The rest ends up sloshing around in your stomach before it goes to the small intestine. In the small intestine, alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream. What's left after that is waste products and water, which moves through the large intestine (colon) until it reaches", "Fifth-grader asks police for help with math homework, and this was their response.

Spider-Man 3 kind of ruined everything The Spider-Man franchise made Tobey Maguire a superstar. It also stunted his career. Well, one of the movies did, anyway. By the time Spider-Man 3 rolled into theaters in 2007, Maguire was riding high off the film's predecessor, which did insanely well among critics and at the box office - to this day, Spider-Man 2 is considered one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. Spider-Man 3 failing to follow in its footsteps was inevitable - and making a better movie felt almost impossible at the time. Still, nobody was quite prepared for just how bad Spider-Man 3 would ultimately be. Even director Sam Raimi admitted Spider-Man 3's shortcomings in a 2014 interview with Nerdist. \"I messed up plenty with the third Spider-Man, so people hated me for years.

Currently, clickbait is often characterized by wording like, \"You won\u2019t believe\" or \"What happened next will shock you,\" or other unverifiable assertions in a desperate attempt to spark your curiosity into a click. Publishers who practice clickbait social strategy the most reliably are often viral mills like Distractify and ViralNova. (ClickHole is a fun example because it parodies clickbait so effectively that its headlines still work as clickbait.) At its worst, this strategy indicates that the publisher is at a loss for how to sell audiences on a story (perhaps due to having sub par content to begin with). Sometimes you\u2019ll find these headlines on social media or on traffic-generating widgets like Taboola, click on them and find yourself with an unoriginal story that just repeats (or even distorts) facts from another site that reported the story first.

But in refusing to so much as poke at the issue, the absence of academic discussion of what causes (or prevents) a hangover has led to a jumble of pseudoscience, anecdotal remedies, and outright nonsense. Wanting to hang his hat on some progress on this front, Richard Stephens oat Keel University created the Alcohol Hangover Research Group, which sounds like a nickname for a fraternity, but is actually a collective of scientists and doctors working to figure this thing out. While it\u2019s still not definitively proven, it\u2019s believed that hangovers come as a result of the chemistry of the drinks. Fermentation of alcohol creates congeners that poison us. It\u2019s believed that darker liquors contain more congeners, which actually lend liquors their color, to a degree. So the notion of \"clearer drink, clearer head\" holds up...to a point.

The price of food at grocery stores has actually been on the decline since the end of 2015, based on the Consumer Price Index for food at home. In fact, in July (the most recent data available), the cost of food at home declined 1.55% from the same month a year ago. On the other hand, the cost of food away from home \u2014 what you pay at restaurants \u2014 is still on the rise. In July, prices for food away from home rose 2.79% from same month last year.

But the drop in food prices is also hurting sales. \"Food cost relief has been a boon to restaurant-level margins in 2016, with many fast food operators generating their", "Mom And Dad Adopt This Pretty Orphan Girl, Then Learn The STUNNING Secret Behind Her Identity...

Written as dating advice for \"The Modern Man\" (a misnomer if ever there were one), it promises a solution to the hot \u2018n\u2019 horny down-on-their-luck young bucks of the world who face the tedious obstacle of a woman wearing headphones, because how dare she. And no, it isn\u2019t a parody. You can read it in its full entitled glory, or stick with me as I dissect each grubby, jaw-dropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness. It\u2019s going to be quite a ride. How to Talk to a Woman Who is Wearing Headphones \"These days, many women walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphones and listening to music at the same time. Yet, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t talk to them. Of course, not all women are open to being approached because not all women are single and looking. However, if a woman wearing headphones is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend (or even a new lover), she will almost always be happy to take off her headphones to give you", "Only Beyonce could pull off something like this. Among the select few were Robin Basile and John Pape, the designers of Basile and Pape Bespoke Jewelry, who were called upon to create custom pieces for the videos. And they had to do it quickly. Stylist Lysa Cooper, who's worked with Beyonce\u0301 as well as Basile and Pape over the years, contacted the design duo on Sept. 18 via her assistant, \"'warning' us that it was time to get the ball rolling on some custom pieces for Beyonce\u0301's new album videos,\" Basile told HuffPost Style. They discussed a few ideas, including a \"YONCE\" necklace, and Lysa forwarded her specifications from video director Hype Williams and his team. Then came the promise: \"Of course I swore on the Bible that I would NEVER tell a soul about the project/email,\" Basile said. \"Then the assistant told me the video shoot would be in Texas on Sept. 25,\" said Basile. That meant four days to create three custom jewelry items and have them shipped to Texas. After they arrived safely... Basile and Pape waited. And waited. And waited. \"I was on edge from the first email we received from Beyonce\u0301's team to the day her visual album came out [on] Dec. 13, 2013,\"", "Hulu's MAJOR News Will Change How You Watch TV. The competition to win viewers is stiff among three of the biggest online movie and TV platforms: Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. But Hulu just made some major announcements that put it ahead of its competitors.At a presentation this morning, the brand confirmed rumors that starting in 2017, it will begin livestreaming TV shows to subscribers. For anyone who has resigned themselves to watching already aired shows on the site, this news is gold. CEO Mike Hopkins hasn't said yet which networks and shows will be available when the new programming starts, but we're crossing our fingers that the major broadcast (Fox, NBC, ABC) and cable (TBS, Bravo, Showtime) networks will join in.Hulu also announced that, like Amazon and Netflix, it's expanding its movie library. It has signed a deal for exclusive rights to a Beatles documentary from Ron Howard, which will be the first of many new documentary movies to be available on the platform. And for those who miss Dr. Mindy Lahiri, the fifth season of The Mindy Project will also be returning to Hulu.While Netflix and Amazon are still winning when it comes to originally produced shows and movies, Hulu is making a strong statement with livestreaming.

Shapiro tells Megyn Kelly on the Fox News Channel anchor's first special, which airs on the Fox broadcast network Tuesday at 8 p.m. Simpson whispered to Shapiro: \"You had told me this would be the result from the beginning. You were right.\" The special, called \"Megyn Kelly Presents,\" has drawn attention for having Kelly's first sit-down interview with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump since the first GOP primary debate last August. Trump vehemently attacked Kelly online and in TV interviews because he was unhappy with her tough questioning as a debate moderator. But Shapiro is also a \"get,\" as they say in the TV news industry, because he has not discussed the Simpson trial with a journalist in 20 years. Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 slayings of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. Along with revealing Simpson's whispered post-verdict comment, Shapiro tells Kelly about the infamous glove that his client was asked to try on in court during the 1995 trial. According to a transcript released by Fox News, Shapiro told Kelly he knew the glove would not fit Simpson because he tried it on first. \"It was a little bit wide in my palm and", "Scientists Uncover Mystery Of Singing Fish. Porichthys notatus, as its scientific name is, has a specific reason for singing. The male fish use them to try to mate, while the females only grunt in response. The unusual sound has been likened to \"an orchestra full of mournful, rasping oboes,\" according to the San Francisco Gate in 2004. Researchers from Cornell University believe they have finally discovered what causes the strange melody: melatonin. Melatonin, a hormone naturally produced by plants and animals, is released at night, the Washington Post reports. In animals \u2013 like humans \u2013 that sleep a night, melatonin is believed to control the internal body clock, telling the rest of the body that it\u2019s tie to sleep. Some have even found a treatment for insomnia in taking melatonin supplements before going to bed. But how melatonin functions in vertebrates that come alive at night has been unclear. Nocturnal animals do make melatonin when night comes, meaning it doesn\u2019t put them to sleep. The new study suggests that melatonin may be more of a trigger to signal night-specific behaviors, including prompting midshipman fish to sing. \"Our results, together with those of others that also show melatonin\u2019s actions on vastly different timescales, highlight the ability of hormones", "It Bitcoin Still a thing? Let's dive into a brief history of Bitcoin, the troubles it has faced, and the answer to the question on so many lips...is Bitcoin still a thing? What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a form of currency that falls under the umbrella of \"cryptocurrency.\" To keep this simple, think of Bitcoin as currency that exists primarily in cyberspace, at a specific Bitcoin address that is linked with an access key. Unlike every other form of currency, it is decentralized, meaning large banks and corporations have no control over it. Plus, Bitcoins are not produced in the same manner as dollars or euros; they are generated by people through a process known as mining, which requires software that can solve complex mathematical problems. Perhaps the biggest selling point of Bitcoin is the finite nature of the currency. There is something called Bitcoin protocol, and it stipulates that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created. That's it. So clearly, as the demand for Bitcoins increases, so, too, does their value. (It's a little like trying to move into a town or city that has outlawed new construction.

I was wary to discuss \"The Sopranos\" at all with Imperioli (who, of course, played mobster Christopher Moltisanti on David Chase's acclaimed show) out of fear that since the subject comes up so many times in his day-to-day life he may just be over it by now. This is not the case. Imperioli's eyes light up as he recounts tale after tale -- including an admission that he wasn't a huge fan of the first script. Imperioli, who I met at his lower Manhattan hotel room, is now co-starring in Spike Lee's \"Oldboy.\" He plays Chucky, a bar owner who helps his childhood friend, Joe (Josh Brolin), on a mysterious quest to find out who has imprisoned Joe for the last 20 years. The results are ... well, not really what you would expect (unless you've seen the Korean film on which \"Oldboy\" is based). Did you audition for \"Oldboy,\" or was the role offered? Spike called me -- I had worked for him a bunch of times. And he called out of the blue and had assumed that I had already gotten the offer from my agent, which I didn't. So he called and said, \"I'm really psyched we're working", "The BBC announces \"Sherlock\" premiere date in most unlikely way.

Leung from power, the city\u2019s unelected chief executive should consider coming to the United States. He might fit in well in the Republican Party. In an interview Monday with The New York Times and other foreign newspapers, Leung explained that Beijing cannot permit the direct election of Hong Kong\u2019s leaders because doing so would empower \"the people in Hong Kong who earn less than $1,800 a month.\" Leung instead defended the current plan to have a committee of roughly 1,200 eminent citizens vet potential contenders because doing so, in the Times\u2019 words, \"would insulate candidates from popular pressure to create a welfare state, and would allow the city government to follow more business-friendly policies.\" If that sounds vaguely familiar, it should.

The two competitors in the taste test: $1 deli coffee versus a $3.25 gourmet option. In the end, 67% of people surveyed preferred the $1 option \u2014 not the coffee that cost three times as much. The fact that most testers prefer the less expensive coffee stands in contrast to recent decisions at Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts to focus on more gourmet offerings.

Dunkin Both chains have emphasized new, more upscale menu items this summer, with executives at both companies citing America's growing interest in coffee culture as a major impact. \"Coffee culture in the country is getting a little bit more sophisticated by the day,\" Chris Fuqua, Dunkin's senior vice president of brand marketing, told Business Insider in June when the chain debuted its Cold Brew. \"Customers really understand what craft coffee beverages are.\"", "Dad Is Outraged When School Cafeteria Stamps Information On His Third Grader's Arm. As it turns out, the elementary school that Bivens\u2019 son attends, Gardendale Elementary in Gardendale, AL, operates its cafeteria with refillable charge cards. Students who buy lunch at school swipe the card to pay for lunch. Parents keep the cards refilled by topping them up with money from time to time and are notified if the balance runs low. Bivens understood the card system, but was shocked by the method of delivery. His little boy brings a packed lunch to school almost every day and rarely needs lunch money, unless he wants to buy a special treat from the cafeteria. As a result, he almost never has to use his school lunch card and his parents decided not to top it up so close to the end of the school year. Still, Jon Bivens told The Huntsville Times that he was stunned by the way that the school had chosen to convey the message to him as a parent. He says that, in the past, the school had called or sent emails or letters to remind parents of the balance. The stamp, which he calls a \"brand,\" was typically a communication of last resort for the school.

Native Americans actually solved this problem hundreds of years ago, and the remnants of their brilliant methods can still be seen today. You just have to know where to look. Believe it or not, but there was a time in North America where we didn\u2019t have any roads. That\u2019s where these special trees came into play. Before the colonization of the continent by Europeans, different groups of Native Americans needed to know how to navigate without the use of roads. So, they came up with the idea of \"marker trees.\" The trees were deliberately bent and manipulated as saplings in order to help them navigate the land. They marked geographic divides and the territories of different tribes. They also marked everything from water sources to burial sites. They also marked the safe crossing points along rivers. The shapes could be different depending on the tribe or their intended meaning. Without any sort of road signs, these were essential for the peoples of North America. Typically, they\u2019re made from trees like oak, maple, and elm. Eventually, the European settlers adopted the marker trees as well. Here\u2019s a diagram of how the saplings were bent.

Rochelle Sirota, RD, CDN, says that stuffing and cooking the turkey could risk the spread of salmonella, a bacterium that is the common cause of foodborne illness. \"It's harder to gauge the heat inside the turkey and you can't really reach all the way inside with a thermometer,\" said Sirota. Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention receive reports of an average 42,000 cases of salmonellosis -- symptoms of salmonella poisoning that include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps -- but thousands more likely go unreported, according to the CDC website. While most people recover from salmonellosis within a few days, complications such as dehydration or an intestinal infection can be life-threatening, according to the Mayo Clinic. The bacteria is spread through contaminated surfaces, water or food. The primary sources of salmonella are undercooked poultry or eggs, although the bacterium has been linked to vegetables and ground meat. The U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests stuffing be cooked apart from the turkey, especially for cooks who don't use a meat or cooking thermometer. The USDA also advises cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, which will take more time if the bird is stuffed, according to a study", "Is this deadly drug becoming a problem in American schools? \"What have I become?\" 23-year-old Andrew Jones asked his mom shortly before he died. \"What's happened to me?\" A star high school athlete who went on to play Division I football for Missouri State University, Andrew was an honors student whom friends described as outgoing, charismatic, and loyal. He was also a heroin addict. Never even a recreational drug user, Andrew had been the first to discourage friends at his Catholic high school from smoking pot. But his story is frighteningly typical of the current heroin epidemic among suburban American youth. It's an issue made all the more timely by the recent heroin-related death of Glee star Cory Monteith, best known and beloved for playing squeaky-clean high school football star Finn Hudson. What Cory and Andrew expose is that heroin isn't at all what it used to be. Not only is the drug much more powerful than before (purity can be as high as 90 percent) but it's also no longer limited to the dirty-needle, back-alley experience so many of us picture. Now it's as easy as purchasing a pill, because that's what heroin has become: a powder-filled capsule known as a button, designed to be broken open and snorted, that", "Why you should lower your standards, according to science. You might think that when presented with a never-ending supply of potential suitors, people would be getting pickier.  After all, with a lot of dating websites like Match and eHarmony, users can specify almost everything they\u2019re looking for in a partner, so why wouldn\u2019t you be choosy? New research has revealed, however, that people are in fact lowering their standards as a result of dating apps and sites. Researchers from the Queensland University of Technology studied data from Australia\u2019s largest dating website RSVP and the dating profiles of over 41,000 people aged between 18 and 80 in a bid to work out whether the rise of online dating has changed people\u2019s habits. They concluded that singletons are disregarding their \u2018check-list\u2019 of criteria and pursuing other potential romantic partners who have sufficient acceptable qualities. The reason that online daters are more likely to settle could be that they\u2019re tired of trying to find the perfect person amongst so many. \"We looked at whether or not people actually contact people who match what they say is their ideal partner in their profile, and our findings show they don't.

Now, a new bemusing lump of biological matter has appeared near the shores of Bunbury, Western Australia, and it\u2019s safe to say that it caused some fishermen a bit of head-scratching. Smooth, pink, fleshy, and unbearably smelly, this chunky conundrum simply couldn\u2019t be identified \u2013 at least at first. Mark Watkins, a fisherman of 21 years, had clearly never seen anything like it. \"When we got closer we realized it had to be a dead whale because of the smell,\" he told the West Australian. \"Its stomach was full of gas so it was all bloated up.\" The stomachs of whales tend to be full of gas during life, but this is normally kept under control. Floating up to the surface some time after death, the Sun's rays began to hit the whale's abdomen, causing the gases to expand and ultimately forcing the stomach to swell up. On occasion, this can cause the cetacean to explode with dramatic, gore-filled fury. After drifting away from the carcass, Watkins spotted it beginning to deflate.

A useful gauge during these moments is to look around and see who looks like they\u2019re having more fun, him or the crowd.

According to a study published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, nail-biting might just be indicative of... perfectionism?? Dr. Kieron O\u2019Connor, author of the study, said \"We believe that individuals with these repetitive behaviors may be perfectionistic, meaning that they are unable to relax and to perform tasks at a normal pace. They are therefore prone to frustration, impatience, and dissatisfaction when they do not reach their goals.\" Basically, nail-biters aren't trying to alleviate their nerves - they're doing it out of frustration. The Study Researchers studied 48 participants, half of whom had repetitive behaviors like nail-biting. The participants filled out surveys designed to test their organizational behavior and emotional regulation. The nail-biters were identified as being organizational perfectionists, a personality type marked by a tendency to make detailed plans and overwork themselves, and they often become frustrated by a lack of activity. Nail-biting and other repetitive behaviors are just their way of releasing their pent-up energy. Impact Of The Study Nail-biting might seem relatively harmless, but it can cause some long-term damage. WebMD says that nail-biting can lead to infection, weak teeth, and deformed nails. These risks, along with how prevalent this behavior is, have made nail-biting", "There\u2019s one group of Americans that consistently cares about climate change.

A long-discussed footbridge project over a Key West waterway has been resuscitated by unlikely champion: a 10-year-old girl who presented plans to City Commissioners last week for an 85-foot rainbow-colored span that would salute Key West's diversity. \"Key West welcomes many different people,\" Adelle Barsky-Moore of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea told commissioners. \"It has equality for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders. The bridge will celebrate diversity with the many colors of the gay pride flag.\" And it could become reality. Barsky-Moore, whose parents are gay, first conceived of the \"Rainbow Pride Bridge\" for a 4th grade class project, spending three weeks building a popsicle-stick model and crafting a presentation, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Her bridge will be \"more fabulous\" than rainbow-colored crosswalks installed in West Hollywood, her PowerPoint presentation promised commissioners. Barsky-Moore calculated the span, built of steel and wood, will cost roughly $132,500 -- but could be partially paid for with funds raised by selling name inscriptions at $100 each. Though she originally designed the bridge for an area just west of Duval Street, commissioners thought it would be perfect over Admiral's Cut as part of a $30 million master plan to develop former Navy property on the waterfront. \"I", "Here's a controversial idea about China's economy that no one wants to hear. For years, economists have been saying that China needs to \"rebalance\" its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project. That means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular Chinese people working in the services sector. That is, China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers. But what if we've got this all wrong? What if China is transitioning too early? That's what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, \"China's new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.\" From the note (emphasis added): \"Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy's potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies. \"Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries. \"This kind of development strategy", "There\u2019s something VERY wrong about this picture....can you spot it? However, look a little closer and eagle eyed readers may be able to spot that there is something very odd about the picture. The photograph shared on Instagram appears to show six friends enjoying the sun on the beach. Leaning toward the camera the mates appear to have all adopted a similar pose and are wearing matching black sunglasses. But those with a keen eye may be able to spot that the photograph has been tampered with. A social media user has photoshopped the face of a man in the background onto the six faces of the women. Once you're aware of the edit to the picture it can seem blindingly obvious however plenty of Instagram users admit that they were stumped.

A recent study by VU University Medical Centre in the A recent study by VU University Medical Centre in the Netherlands looked at the relationship between sleep duration, insulin sensitivity and the potential onset of diabetes and heart disease. The results found that seven hours spent in deep sleep is the perfect amount to maintain reasonable insulin production and glucose levels. This means that the amount of time spent in bed is probably more than seven hours - more like seven and a half. Sleeping less than seven hours has been proven to disrupt glucose metabolism in men and women. A stable glucose level contributes to weight control, and if it is disrupted, could lead to weight gain, and the early onset of diabetes. So how do Britons fare?

When the Goldsboro, N.C., resident spotted the freezer at her neighbor\u2019s yard sale last month, she thought she was getting a good deal. The neighbor was charging $30 for a deep freezer with a hinged lid \u2014 the kind of freezer large enough for someone to climb inside. But the neighbor said there was a caveat, she recalled to WNCN. She couldn\u2019t start using the freezer immediately because the neighbor had promised to lend it out to her church\u2019s Sunday school class for a \"time capsule\" project. The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, says her neighbor told her the church would come to pick up the items inside the freezer, which was sealed shut with duct tape. Afterwards, the buyer was supposed to get the freezer back. So the woman waited. Three weeks passed; the church members never came. \"Nothing was adding up, so I started to become suspicious about it,\" the woman told WRAL.

The scientists found the colossal trough while charting the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands, an ancient subglacial mountain range in the area, and detailed the discovery in a paper published in the January issue of the Geological Society of America Bulletin. \"The discovery of this huge trough, and the characterization of the surrounding mountainous landscape, was incredibly serendipitous,\" the paper's lead author, Dr. Neil Ross, a physical geography lecturer at Newcastle University in the U.K., said in a written statement. \"To me, this just goes to demonstrate how little we still know about the surface of our own planet. The discovery and exploration of hidden, previously unknown landscapes is still possible and incredibly exciting, even now.\" Dubbed Ellsworth Trough, the trench was created tens of million years ago by a small, \"dynamic\" ice field that slowly carved out the dramatic formations now hidden beneath a layer of ice more than a mile thick.

The young man would frequently text his mother about all sorts of things to keep up with her. They were always in touch. Just about any mother would speak highly of her children, but there was something extra special about the way that Carole talked about Taylor. Their relationship was undoubtedly a close one, ever since day one. Of course, the feeling was mutual for Taylor, who wasn\u2019t shy about telling his mother about all sorts of important things. He\u2019d often tell her about all of his life\u2019s goals, many of which he was lucky and hard-working enough to achieve.

When Gordy appeared on \"Oprah's Master Class,\" he opened up about a Temptations album he didn't want to release -- an album that won Motown its first Grammy. The reason behind Gordy's reluctance? Responsibility. \"A song is a very powerful thing in somebody's mind, especially young people,\" Gordy explains. \"I taught my [Motown staff], 'What a child hears, he believes; what he believes, he does.'... We stayed away from songs that were attacking anybody because a lot of people will follow our songs and song ideas.\" This meant that Gordy would argue against a song or album that didn't align with his vision for Motown. He may have been the founder of the company, but was so dedicated to its democratic structure, he would allow himself to be outvoted by his Motown colleagues. This is exactly what happened with the Temptations' psychedelic album \"Cloud Nine.\" \"I said that was a drug record and I didn't want to put it out,\" Gordy says simply. \"[My staff] outvoted me. I was very, very upset.\" Motown released \"Cloud Nine,\" despite Gordy's disapproval, and the album's title track won the Grammy for Best Rhythm & Blues Group Performance, Vocal or Instrumental in 1969. \"It happened,", "A LADY COMPLAINED TO THE PERSON WHO STOLE HER PARKING SPACE AND YOU WILL NEVER GUESS THE RESPONSE SHE GOT.

Here's the challenge. If a married couple retiring at age 65 wants to have 90% certainty that they can cover healthcare expenses in retirement (Medicare Part B and Part D premiums, MediGap premiums, and out-of-pocket drug expenses), they'll need $265,000, and high drug expenses could bring that up to $349,000, according to Employee Benefit Research Institute findings. And that figure does not include long-term care expenses, which can run $10,000 a month. This is not a trivial matter! says Dychtwald. When he turned 65, two years ago, he was besieged with health insurance policy offerings for Medigap coverage. Medicare doesn't cover everything; that's why you probably need MediGap coverage. And watch out for Medicare premium surcharges if your income is over $85,000 ($170,000 for joint filers). These points come as a surprise for many as they approach or hit retirement.

Then they discovered a litter of four tiny babies. They think that the cat stayed in the equipment room for at most 3 days. But the cat is not stranger to the players, because they saw her walking around and they believe that she lives around the arena. The bag belonged to one of their goalies. When the mama cat realized that the players were coming, she looked at them very happy and it was like she was introducing her babies to the whole team.

In the past decade, Marvel has become the standard-bearer for contemporary blockbuster filmmaking. There are a lot of reasons for the studio\u2019s success ranging, from exemplary casting, solid narrative structure, and wealth of source material to draw creative inspiration from. However, despite all their success, there is plenty of room for their storytelling to grow. One of the most prevalent criticisms of Marvel Studios\u2019 theatrical releases is that the films lack memorable villains that will stand the test of time, with critics pointing out that their roster of baddies all seem to mimic the given protagonist\u2019s own skill set. While Marvel\u2019s methodology may be transparent, their approach to introducing villains is by design. During our visit to the set of Doctor Strange, Marvel President Kevin Feige stated the benefits of telling superhero origin stories with villains who mirror the lead: \"Clearly we will get to that [non-doppelganger match ups]... You want to have characters that inhabit the same world when introducing a new world, a new mythology for lack of a better term. You want to explore that as much as you can.\" Marvel\u2019s approach of starting out with villains that resemble the hero isn\u2019t unique to the MCU \u2013 in", "The Voice In The 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Trailer Is...

Because he was at the center of J.J. Abrams\u2019 last big mystery, it was a fun option to consider. There will be no more considering. The identity of the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer voice has been revealed. Update: Andy Serkis has given a brief radio interview confirming that it is his voice in the trailer. Watch that below. The Force Awakens trailer voice is, in fact, Andy Serkis, seen below in his Avengers: Age of Ultron look. Steve from Collider was the first to definitely say the voice was Serkis. Still many remained skeptical. Harry Knowles from Ain\u2019t It Cool News even posted that he confirmed it was \"not\" Serkis, but that sentiment was quickly changed. Finally, Hitfix got on the case and bolstered Collider\u2019s earlier point: For the record, that is Andy Serkis you hear in the trailer.

In a letter dated Oct. 3, Santa Clara University President Michael Engh announced the 2014 change to the Jesuit university's 1,600 employees. \"Our core commitments as a Catholic university are incompatible with the inclusion of elective abortion coverage in the University's health plans,\" Engh wrote in the letter. The move appears to be part of a trend among Catholic campuses seeking to uphold their religious beliefs while employing and enrolling many non-Catholics, the Los Angeles Times notes. Just this week, Loyola Marymount University, a Catholic university in Los Angeles, also announced that it will eliminate elective abortion coverage for its staff starting next year. The move by both universities was met with outrage by some of its staff, who thought there should have been more dialogue before a decision was made. \"The policy comes as quite a shock,\" Nancy Unger, a history professor at Santa Clara, said to NBC. \"There was no discussion. There was a request for discussion afterwards, which many of us felt was really sort of patronizing.\" President Obama's Affordable Care Act requires that birth control be covered but allows employers to restrict abortion coverage.

Investing in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition. You buy a bond. Then you get back interest payment. So easy, even your great uncle Mort can do it. Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate\u2019s senior business and economics correspondent. These days, things aren't so straightforward: The sovereign-debt markets have devolved into a bizarro world of upside-down expectations. Yields on government bonds from all around the world have been plunging thanks to anxious investors buying them for their safety. (Bond yields fall as prices rise.) And in many instances, the returns have cratered below zero. As Quartz reports Thursday, \"around a third of all developed-country government debt\u2014or more than $7 trillion, in terms of market value\u2014is now trading at negative yields,\" meaning that buyers are willing to pay more for these bonds than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity. This is remarkable. Countries like Germany have been selling short- and midterm debt at negative yields for a while, but now it\u2019s happening with bonds dated for 10 years or longer.

This is where they should REALLY be kept. Last night's Food Unwrapped on Channel 4 revealed the correct way to store everyday store cupboard essentials, from bread to coffee. And it turns out the fridge isn't always the best place to keep your food, even when it comes to fresh vegetables. If you want your tomatoes to taste the best they possibly can, don't store them in the fridge, according to food safety expert Holly Jefferys. Though disputed by some, she said that the 'taste and texture' is affected by keeping them in cool conditions. However keeping tomatoes in the fridge does make them last longer, so it's up to you whether or not you want tasty tomatoes or want them to last as long as possible. But Polly recommends taking them out of the fridge 24 hours before you plan to use them.  The show, which airs every Monday at 8.30pm, also looked into the best ways to store bread and coffee. Could their taste or freshness be improved by storing them in the fridge? The answer was a resolute no - so stop putting these products in the fridge if you've been doing so up until now.

It's not just specific retailers cashing in on the sock craze anymore. \"Early on you could really find novelty socks (only) in some of the better specialty and department stores, but over the past years, the reason why it's grown is because you can get them anywhere from Target to the department stores.

BoldSocks.com is one example. The online retailer was started in 2011 as a fun competition between friends Ryan Preisner and Adam Whitmore. At the time, they didn't expect to have a brilliant business plan on their hands, but they have since expanded to two brands, Statement Sockwear and BoldSocks, as a way to keep up with consumer demand for socks with unique patterns and colors. \"Our first year's sales, in most people's minds, were quite pathetic, but we have seen nonstop growth ever since.

The current word on the street is that the iPhone 7, expected this fall, is going to be fairly boring. Instead, the next exciting iPhone will come out in 2017, and it could have several new features, like wireless charging, an edge-to-edge screen, and better camera all wrapped up in a glass body. Catcher Technology makes some of the aluminum shells for the iPhone 6. So its CEO, Allen Horng, might have inside information on Apple's chassis plans. And on Thursday, he said: \"As far as I know, only one [iPhone] model will adopt glass casing next year,\" after Catcher's annual shareholder meeting, Nikkei reports. He continued: \"I don't think this move will have an impact on Catcher's revenue, as glass casing still needs a durable metal frame, which requires advanced processing technology and would not be cheaper than the current model.\" As Nikkei points out, one-third of Catcher's revenue comes from Apple, so it's a critical customer for the company. Before the iPhone 6 came out, with its Catcher-supplied case, company revenues ballooned.

There are 42 percent fewer teen births now than just seven years ago. In 2007, 4.2 percent of teenage girls in the United States gave birth. In 2014, the rate was 2.4 percent. This is an incredibly fast change in a public health trend, and it\u2019s left some researchers puzzled over how it happened so quickly. But researchers Laura Lindberg, John Santelli, and Sheila Desai say it\u2019s not a mystery at all. Writing in the Journal of Adolescent Health, they find that teenage girls in 2012 were just as likely to be sexually active as girls in 2007. Survey research shows that 43 percent of girls between 15 and 19 said they\u2019d ever had sex in 2007, compared with 45 percent in 2012. What changed was how teenage girls used contraceptives. The percentage of sexually active teens who used at least one type of birth control the last time they had sex rose from 78 percent in 2007 to 86 percent in 2012. More teens gravitated toward better types of birth control \u2014 like pills, IUDs, or implants \u2014 rather than relying on lower-quality birth control like condoms. This study only included data through 2012, and, as the researchers note, it\u2019s", "\"Spider-Man\" star slams reboot movies. Dafoe, who starred as Norman Osborn (a.k.a. Green Goblin) in Sam Raimi's 2002 film about the young webslinger, told Total Film that he was disappointed to see the studio take another crack at the character. \"I saw a trailer for the first Spider-Man reboot and I thought, 'This is crazy! It's not shot for shot, but it's the same story,'\" Dafoe said. \"I thought, 'This is sort of a cynical approach to making money!'\" Indeed, while there were some major differences between 2002's \"Spider-Man\" and 2012's \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" -- notably, that Spider-Man fights The Lizard instead of Green Goblin, and that Mary Jane doesn't appear -- the film's were largely structured the same, owing to the fact that \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" was yet another origin story for the character. Dafoe isn't the first \"Spider-Man\" actor to question the existence of \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\" James Franco, who played Dafoe's onscreen son, Harry, in the film and its sequels, has gone on record twice before about his issues with director Marc Webb's reboot. \"I mean, they could have strayed a little bit more from the original,\" Franco said to MTV in January of this year. \"It's like, 'Why?'

Premium food, premium services and shows and entertainment worthy of Las Vegas are all just part of the deal when you book a cruise. Normally, when you\u2019re arranging a cruise, you expect to pay a significant price for the luxury of fine dining and entertainment at sea \u2013 and most cruise passengers are paying substantially. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. In the last few years the economy has made it difficult for many couples and families to travel much farther than their own backyards. This coupled with the fact that many cruise companies have built magnificent new ships complete with every amenity under the sun means you have a golden opportunity for discount cruise prices. Cruise liners are huge and they have tremendous amounts of space available for passengers. Would-be passengers are waiting for the economy to improve. This leaves you in the position to maximize on those unsold cabins by snatching up a once-in-a-lifetime cruise experience with huge discounts. You might only pay 20% of what other ship passengers are paying simply because you know the best ways to find cruise deals on the Internet.

After Mixner's death, Taylor went to the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery, where her brother and sister are also buried, and requested to be buried next to her wife's ashes when the times comes, according to Idaho news outlet KTVB. Though the cemetery normally permits veterans and their spouses to be buried next to one another, the Idaho Division of Veterans Services denied Taylor's application because the state refuses to recognize her marriage. \"I'm not surprised,\" Taylor told Idaho news outlet KBOI. \"I've been discriminated against for 70 years, and they might as well discriminate against me in death as well as life.\" Taylor grew up in a military family.

Early in the third quarter in Philadelphia, the 32-year-old wideout attempted to catch a pass from Philip Rivers and was then wrapped up from behind by Eagles safety Nate Allen. With Allen pushing Floyd from behind, his momentum carried him into a hard hit from Eagles linebacker DeMeco Ryans. Floyd's head was down and Ryan appeared to be leading with his shoulder as the three players came together. The ball dropped for an incomplete pass and Floyd went down with a potentially serious injury. Floyd remained down on the field for several minutes before he was strapped to a stretcher. Players from both teams gathered around as Floyd was attended to by medical personnel. He was then placed in an ambulance for transport to a local hospital.

Many lab tests are, in fact, tests of biomarkers. Sugar or protein in a sample of urine can shed light on what\u2019s happening in the kidneys or pancreas. The concentration of cholesterol in the blood may hint at disease in the arteries. What\u2019s changed is medicine\u2019s ability to measure more molecules, with greater precision and less cost, than was possible in the past. The result is a storehouse of information on millions of people, most of it available at the prick of a hypodermic needle.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers accountant Brian Cullinan was supposed to hand the best picture envelope to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway on Sunday. In a statement, PwC said he \"mistakenly handed [them] the back-up envelope for actress in a leading role instead.\" It's also emerged that Cullinan tweeted a picture of Emma Stone backstage just minutes before the mix-up took place. The tweet has since been deleted, though it survives on various websites and on a cached Google page. Cullinan had a complete set of envelopes on one side of the stage, while Martha Ruiz, another PwC accountant, had a duplicate set on the other. This explains why both best actress winner Emma Stone and Beatty ended up in possession of an envelope related to the best actress award. Beatty was evidently confused by the contents of the envelope, passing the card onto his former Bonnie and Clyde co-star. Seeing the words \"La La Land\" beneath Emma Stone's name, Dunaway declared her musical romance the winner of the best picture award.

The rear-view mirror should be able to locate any car behind yours. It's", "Mysterious discovery under the water in China will awaken your inner Indiana Jones.

To get a sense of which large cities give job seekers the best chance of finding employment, we looked to data from Indeed.com, a large job search platform that operates throughout the U.S. and internationally. The company provided us numbers on which cities in the U.S. have the most job openings per capita. We folded Indeed's numbers into an easy-to-read slideshow of the top 10 easiest cities for finding a job, which you will find below. Indeed.com pulls this jobs-per-capita data at various points throughout the year so we looked at which cities made jumps over last quarter, as the most recent data we are using for our list emerged in October. Richmond, Virginia, comes in sixth place in this latest data set, having jumped up from ninth place last quarter. Nashville, which placed eighth by the latest numbers, had previously placed sixth, showing a small drop. The top three cities with the most open jobs per capita are static from last quarter. In third place we see Denver, Colorado, which shows 57 job openings per 1,000 residents in that metropolitan region. In second place we see Salt lake City, Utah, with 65 jobs per 1,000 people living there, and in", "Kanpur Couple Called Off Their Wedding Because Of PM Narendra Modi. You'll Be Surprised To Know Why. Now imagine both these parties getting married to each other. All hell breaks loose right? Right. That\u2019s exactly what happened with a couple from Kanpur. So it was a regular, happy, couple-y day where the bride-to-be, a Government employee was meeting some wedding-errands with her groom, a businessman. Everything was fine until PM Narendra Modi was mentioned in their conversation. The woman strongly believed that PM Narendra Modi is responsible for poverty and other terrible conditions in our country. Whereas the husband felt otherwise. He strongly believed that NaMo is doing his best to fix everything, gradually. Little did they know that the Prime Minister of India is going to be the reason why they\u2019re going to separate. Both of them had a heated argument on this topic and eventually decided to call it quits. Yep. It\u2019s safe to call Narendra Modi the most influential person in our country right now because he\u2019s influential enough to get a couple to call it quits. How many politicians have done that before, eh? News sourced from TOI", "You won\u2019t believe how much money the NFL brought in last year. If you're having trouble grasping the meaning of that massive amount of money, the NFL would qualify as one of the richest countries on the world, at least according to Wikipedia. Their numbers would put them somewhere in the 145 range. The league would rank somewhere around No. 50 overall when it comes to private companies as well, according to this list from Forbes. More comparisons to help put $7.24 billion in context: Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers makes an average annual salary of $22 million -- to put this into perspective, the Packers made just over 10 times that amount in national revenue alone. As the only NFL team publicly owned by fans, the Packers are required to release this financial information on a yearly basis. The numbers are up significantly from last year, in which roughly $6 billion was split between the teams. That's a pretty significant increase, which isn't surprising given the fact that new TV deals kicked in this past season. Those TV deals include new basic deals with CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC, ESPN and the NFL Network, including the Thursday Night Football package for CBS. That deal was worth $275 million, and has been renewed for 2015", "WATCH: NFL star shakes his booty as Britney Spears. In an interview with Dan Hellie, host of \"NFL Total Access,\" the 32-year-old NFL star admitted that he masqueraded as the pop star during a pep rally at his Oklahoma high school while he was a student there. \"Gosh, I\u2019d love to say false there, but I did... they have me on video,\" the Denver Broncos wide receiver told Hellie in response to questions about the high school dance routine, adding: \"But I've already bought them off, so you won't be seeing that anything soon.\" It looks like Welker may have been cheated out of his money, however, as a video of him dressed up and shaking his booty like Spears was actually leaked online by News9.com last year: According to the news outlet, Welker danced to the pop princess' hit song \"(You drive me) crazy\" in 1999 during his senior year at Heritage Hall High School in Oklahoma City. Welker was reportedly a football star at his school -- and quite the prankster. \"He was a superstar in the homecoming pep assembly lip sync contest in his senior year,\" the footballer's former teacher Betsy Horn told News9.com. \"He was a backup dancer.

Your first thought on seeing this weird pink snow might be an industrial accident or a nearby Big Foot massacre. Rest assured, it\u2019s neither\u2014just a perfectly natural, snow-dwelling algae. So, why are scientists all in a tizzy about it? Because it\u2019s causing glaciers to melt faster. That\u2019s the startling conclusion of a study just published in Nature Communications that which suggests we may have seriously underestimated the ability of tiny red algae to screw with Earth\u2019s ice caps. And their so-called \"bio-albedo\" feedback is only expected to grow as the planet warms up. Red snow algae have been described all over the world in polar and alpine settings from Greenland and Antarctica to Iceland and the European Alps. In the winter, they lie dormant in the snow as spores. But in the late spring and summer, when their icy habitat begins to melt, they blossom to produce striking pink landscapes. Now, a sweeping analysis of red snow algae across 21 glaciers in the pan-European Arctic shows that these tiny critters are actually helping the snow melt faster.

Back in the early \u201980s, Barneys, my longtime employer, organized a series of customer focus groups. The time seemed right. It was a period of rapid change. \"Casual Friday\" was the big news on Wall Street, and the men of America were struggling to adapt. Lacking the Italian tradition of spiffy sartorial informality, American blokes plunged into crisis, to mention nothing of plunging into a lot of seriously tragic clothing: baggy Dockers with belt pagers, excruciatingly naff golf shirts and top-siders and white tube socks. Confusion reigned. It seemed like the perfect moment to take the pulse of our male customers and find out what was, and was not, informing their fashion choices. Our research revealed something rather shocking: The main preoccupation for men when shopping for casual clothing, or suits and coats, was not glamour, fashion, or style. The overriding concern of all our sampled dudes was a fear of \"getting it wrong.\" Those male shoppers of yore, the poor darlings, lived with a veritable sword of Damocles hanging over their combovers. They believed in the existence of a mysterious set of edicts that governed the dressing of the male body. Failure to obey would result in certain death. The", "Considering a career change? Here's how to prepare financially:. While the good news is that the IRS considers some job search expenses tax deductible, the bad news is that those expenses can be hard to prepare for in periods of employment uncertainty. I sat down with five of my favorite finance experts to gather their advice on how to make the most of your money during a career pivot. 1. Pad Your Savings A career change is a major life transition and shouldn't be taken lightly. We typically spend more during life transitions and a career change is no different. Prepare for your overhead and fixed costs but also think about any one-time special expenses you may incur. Is the corporate culture and dress code different where you are going? Are you expected to cover more or less costs up-front for work-related expenses? Make sure you're saving for these transition costs well in advance of your resignation date. 2. Know How Long You Can Float Have a good understanding of your monthly expenses (what comes in and what goes out) and beef up your emergencies and opportunities fund in the months prior to your departure. This will help you know where you have room to cut back and make adjustments,", "Lowe's Greeter with Big Smile Gets Bigger Surprise.

The new paper by two Princeton University economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, concludes that the trend is driven by the loss of steady middle-income jobs for those with a high school diploma or less. The economists also argue that dwindling job opportunities have triggered broader problems for this group. They are more likely than their college-educated counterparts, for example, to be unemployed, unmarried or suffering from poor health. \"This is a story of the collapse of the white working class,\" Deaton said in an interview. \"The labor market has very much turned against them.\" Those dynamics helped fuel the rise of President Donald Trump, who won widespread support among whites with only a high school diploma. Yet Deaton said his policies are unlikely to reverse these trends, particularly the health care legislation now before the House that Trump is championing. That bill would lead to higher premiums for older Americans, the Congressional Budget Office has found. \"The policies that you see, seem almost perfectly designed to hurt the very people who voted for him,\" Deaton said. Case and Deaton\u2019s paper, issued by the Brookings Institution, follows up on research they released in 2015 that first documented a sharp increase in", "Leighton Meester's (@itsmeleighton) role model would make Blair Waldorf proud. The \"Gossip Girl\" star spoke to OOTD magazine about her recent collaboration with Nelly.com as well as the people who have influenced her and lessons she's learned during her career. When asked who her role model was, Meester responded: The American writer Betty Friedan -- she fought for gender equality and wrote the great book The Feminine Mystique which sparked the beginning of a second-wave feminism. She went on to agree that she identifies as a feminist, stating: \"I believe in equal rights for men and women.\" Given the shocking number of female celebrities who refuse to identify as feminists, we're excited to see Meester join the ranks of those who aren't afraid of the \"F-word.\" And her advice to young girls who want to succeed is refreshingly practical: \"Read and fight for an education.\" This is the best thing we've heard Meester say since she announced that \"Hillary Clinton is one of my role models -- I do not break treaties, you ass,\" as Blair Waldorf.

Today marks the first day of a pie- and beer-only diet.

For breakfast, lunch and dinner I'll be eating pies only and, on a Friday, I can exchange one pie for three beers, which has a similar amount of calories.

With a net favorability rating of -32 percent according to FiveThirtyEight and \"exactly zero\" chance of winning, according to The Atlantic, how has Trump seemingly emerged victorious from a pool of 17 Republican hopefuls? To try to answer that question would be to travel down a rabbit hole of speculation that has swallowed so many. One thing is sure, though: While Donald Trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits. The reality is that Trump\u2014like policymakers and politicians past, present and future\u2014is operating within the confines of the Overton Window of Political Possibility. The Overton Window: When You Think About It, It\u2019s So True... This theory, named for the late Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. The Overton Window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. Although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window. For example, consider federal welfare policy. Even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty", "This is why Trump's suits fit so badly. Donald Trump makes no secret of his wealth, so you\u2019d think he might be able to find a suit that fits. His trousers are too baggy, his jackets are boxy, his ties are too wide and often too long, and his lapels are too big. Trump is not the only politician guilty of wearing ill-fitting suits - across the world, the political elite dress terribly. But why? Is it deliberate, or do politicians just have bad taste? With their sartorial advisors and ample funds, surely they could make the effort to see a tailor? Well the reason is actually three-fold: Firstly, politicians all want to appear relatable - they avoid looking too slick or flashy so as not to alienate working class voters who can\u2019t afford a \u00a35,000 suit. During last year\u2019s election campaign, Hillary Clinton was blasted for wearing a $12,000 (\u00a39,600) Armani jacket and Theresa May sparked outrage for wearing a pair of \u00a3995 leather trousers.

In the Ravens' announcement Friday, the team did not cite a reason for Cody\u2019s release. However, a Ravens spokesman told the Associated Press that the team was \"aware\" of the investigation. Cody's agent, Peter Schaffer, told the Sun that his client\u2019s dog, a bull mastiff, had died after the NFL player took the animal to a veterinarian. \"He loves this dog,\" the agent said. \"Why would he have the dog treated otherwise?

Are you ready for the answer? Here it is: None. There are exactly zero Black Friday deals worth getting enough to hurt someone, or risk being hurt yourself. This is what Tickle-Me-Elmo thinks of the fact that your deranged, barbaric consumerism allowed your mind to go there even for a second: (via YouTube) While we're with Elmo on this one -- and you really should be too -- hordes of people around the nation must be at least a little less sure.

That strain of criticism became all the more pronounced in the buildup to the AMC drama's series finale, with Vulture launching the latest broadside against the show's popularity as author Michael Idov argued that it wasn't truly popular, just overhyped. (To support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in Russia.) To some degree, this is true. Back when the series debuted, the media wrote about Mad Men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. The first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times \u2014 a much more perilous event in an age when DVRs and streaming services were less prevalent. But by season two, the awards and critical attention Mad Men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run. Still, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in Idov's words, shoving Mad Men down readers' throats. Here are five. 1) Readers wanted to read about it In my pre-Vox life, I was the TV editor of The A.V.

Shockingly, federal funding for research into pizza nutrition has been limited, so there\u2019s no strict scientific consensus on how many calories make the jump from pizza to paper towel when a slice is blotted. The closest approximation comes from the Food Network\u2019s series Food Detectives. Host Ted Allen and a team of researchers from Popular Science came up with the figure of \"35 calories per slice on average (3.5 grams of oil).\" CNN\u2019s Dr. Roshini Raj gives a similar appraisal: \"You are probably cutting 20 to 50 calories a piece \u2013 not a whole lot, but [...] if you have a couple of slices, it adds up.\" With an average slice of cheese pizza weighing in at 272 calories, blotting off 35 calories per piece equals a 13% reduction. Nutrition-savvy readers might recognize that 35 calories also equates to 1/100th of 3,500 calories: the number doctors generally agree equals one pound of human fat.

An alarming new study shows that it\u2019s not just cancer, heart disease and other ailments we have to worry about when it comes to smoking: lighting up can also alter our DNA. A new study has found that smoking alters more than 7,000 genes in ways that may contribute to the development of these diseases, and don\u2019t go away completely even when we stop smoking. Scientists based their conclusions on results from blood samples taken from 16,000 people in 16 other studies, finding that those who stopped smoking saw their genes recover for the most part within five years of quitting, showing that the sooner you stop smoking, the better. But the research team, led by Dr. Stephanie London of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Science, also found that some genetic changes remains 30 years later, according to the study. The researchers looked at a process called DNA methylation, which are genetic changes that don\u2019t alter the underlying cold but can change how they are expressed.

That has been true in the public sector, where disclosing pay information is often required.

It's so huge, in fact, that it doesn't actually orbit the sun. Not exactly.

Here's how that works. When a small object orbits a big object in space, the less massive one doesn't really travel in a perfect circle around the larger one. Rather, both objects orbit a combined center of gravity. In situations we're familiar with \u2014 like Earth orbiting the much-larger sun \u2014 the center of gravity resides so close to the center of the larger object that the impact of this phenomenon is negligible. The bigger object doesn't seem to move, and the smaller one draws a circle around it. But reality is always more complicated.

By taking the Alcoholics Anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective. Instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions: The impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety. By celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal. The Dangers of Dreaming Big We are encouraged on a daily basis to \"dream big\" and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things. This phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived.

But after the third baby was delivered, they realized a fourth was hiding behind her three sisters. \"They had got the three out and they said, 'More feet,'\" Fugate told Good Morning America. \"'More feet' ... that's all I heard and I said, 'Nooo!'\" Though once unexpected, Kenleigh Rosa, Kristen Sue, Kayleigh Pearl and Kelsey Roxanne are now known as the \"Fugate Four\".

They'll have to remain in observation at University of Mississippi Medical Center until May. According to the New York Daily News, giving birth to four identical babies is rare. Only 60 cases have been documented in medical history. Even Fugate's doctor, Dr. James Bofill, was shocked -- and embarrassed.

That last one may not have made it on your checklist for finding your last home, apartment or condo, but doctors now say it probably should have. Even though they save energy, some light-emitting diode (or LED) streetlights are too bright and may actually be putting your health and security at risk, according to new recommendations from the American Medical Association, the largest professional association of doctors in the U.S. The benefits of LED lights include a lot of energy and cost savings. They use up to 50 percent less energy than conventional lights. And the lifetime of LED lights is two to four times that of older, non-LED lights, which means lower maintenance costs for cities that need to change a street\u2019s lightbulbs when they go out. But the bottom line from the AMA is that high-intensity LED streetlights that emit too much blue light can actually throw off sleep patterns of the people living in those neighborhoods and make nighttime glare on roads worse than conventional lights. \"Despite the energy efficiency benefits, some LED lights are harmful when used as street lighting,\" Maya A.

Quartz reporter Mike Murphy compiled a new collection of data showcasing the price of video game consoles, adjusted for inflation. The results certainly put the $599 Oculus Rift into perspective, as the all-time priciest system is the relatively obscure Neo Geo, which launched in 1990 for the equivalent of $1,179 today. (It was $649.99 back then.) Take a look: At least you were getting your money's worth from the Neo Geo. Somewhat unbelievably, the system was still supported as late as 2004, when its final game -- \"Samurai Shodown V Special\" -- was released. The chart also reveals that Nintendo systems have always been pretty good values. All things equal, Nintendo consoles fall toward the bottom of the list, perhaps because the company places such emphasis on first-party software like \"Mario Kart\" and \"Super Smash Brothers.\" The company makes a lot of money on its own games and original properties, in other words. Some might complain Nintendo's systems also seem a bit outdated by the time they're released -- in terms of sheer horsepower, the Wii lagged behind the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, much as the Wii U is technically less impressive than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

For beginners, start with five minutes a day, then work up to 15.  WHAT TO EAT Cardio exercise such as skipping requires a healthy heart.

Cut Out Fizzy Drinks Seriously \u2013 this is one of the easiest ways to start dropping off the pounds. Whilst each individual bottle might not contain that many calories, the tendency to drink it in large quantities adds up. Try swapping out fizzy drinks for just plain water \u2013 and if you simply must have something more, swap to something like a fresh fruit smoothie.

Last fall, the Warriors hired a famous person for an obscure position, tabbing two-time MVP Steve Nash as a player development consultant. The job description was as amorphous as the title suggests. Nash worked out a bit with Klay Thompson. He sent texts to Steph Curry. A few days every month he flew from his home in Los Angeles to Oakland. Occasionally he addressed the team, walking through actions and demonstrating ball screens. But Nash, who retired only a year ago, was not looking for a full-time gig. He is a father of three, the general manager of the Canadian national team and a promising movie producer. In 2014, when Nash was still a Laker, he agreed to film conversations with other luminaries for a Vice Sports series called \"Back & Forth.\" In the most notable video, Nash sits on a black leather sofa, wearing a T-shirt and shorts.

For a football-obsessed nation like Nigeria, talent can be found in every corner, but there's definitely something special about Ajegunle, or AJ City, as it's known by locals. Since the early 1990s, Ajegunle has been churning out football talent. Famous names such as Taribo West, Odion Ighalo, Brown Ideye, Samson Siasia, Obafemi Martins, Taribo West and Jonathan Akpoborie all started here. Life is not easy for many of the residents of this sprawling ghetto. They have to contend with high crime rates, as well the absence of running water, grid-powered electricity or healthcare. So what are the factors that contribute to Ajegunley's footballing pedigree? Diversity, for one. \"It's a community with so many people from different ethnicities,\" says Bennedict Ehenemba, a football scout for German clubs who is a native of Ajegunle. \"Ajegunle accommodates the Yorubas, the Igbos, the Hausas, the Itsekiris and all the other tribes in Nigeria. \"It's a raw talent hub of Nigeria,\" he tells me. Many success stories can be traced back to two local institutions - St Mary's Catholic Church and the Navy Barracks Camp. They remain safe places for many young people to play the game.

(ANTIWAR) Thirteen years of wars in the Middle East, since the illegal and criminal invasion of Iraq by the United States and Britain in 2003, have killed way over a million people; destroyed Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya, and created millions of refugees. The terrorist attacks by Daesh (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East have strengthened xenophobia, Islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners. Daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of Iraq that led to the emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in Libya and Syria. Can things get any worse? Not only can they, we should expect new wars in the Middle East if Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president is elected next November. Even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives\u2019 enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the Middle East will be. Hillary Clinton is a hawk and warmonger.

Rahmani had been a symbol of efforts to improve the situation of women in her country, more than a decade after the fall of the Taliban regime.

Recent work revealed that the digestive systems of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) resemble that of carnivores and omnivorous bears \u2013 even though their transition to a vegetarian diet happened some 2 million years ago. Their gut and gut microbes are built for breaking down meat and small amounts of plant matter, yet pandas eat up to a third of their body weight in bamboo every day. A team led by Garret Suen from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ashli Brown of Mississippi State studied two giant pandas living at the Memphis Zoological Society in Tennessee: a female named YaYa and a male named LeLe (pictured above). The team observed the pandas\u2019 bamboo consumption behavior, and they collected fresh feces (pictured to the right) as well as samples of mucous excretion. Pandas undergo dramatic seasonal shifts in diet: Most of the time, they eat bamboo stalks, but in August and September, they shift to leaves. Shortly after this summertime shift from woody stalks to less fibrous leaves, the pandas experience episodes of gastrointestinal tract distress, with symptoms ranging from abdominal pain to the excretion of mucous stools containing gelatinous pellets called mucoids.

The most important factor for success According to Alice Schroeder, in 1991 when Bill Gates' dad asked Buffett and Gates what the most important factor for their success was, they both gave the same answer, \"focus.\" Gates' focus was illustrated in Walter Isaacson's new book The Innovators, as well as Gates' fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen: One trait that differentiated the two was focus. Allen's mind would flit between many ideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor. \"Where I was curious to study everything in sight, Bill would focus on one task at a time with total discipline,\" said Allen. \"You could see it when he programmed. He would sit with a marker clenched in his mouth, tapping his feet and rocking; impervious to distraction.\" Steve Jobs was the same way; he was relentlessly focused on attacking problems searching for the best answer.

Save the Children\u2019s \"Lottery of Birth\" report, released on Wednesday, assessed 87 low- and middle-income countries\u2019 child and maternal mortality rates. While many of the findings were deterring, the study noted that a number of underserved countries, including Malawi, have made significant strides in these health areas with replicable programs. Since 1990, the African country has reduced its child mortality rates by 72 percent. Two years ago, there were 68 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 244 in 1990. While Malawi is still far off from obtaining equitable health outcomes among the rich and the poor, it has outpaced other sub-Saharan African countries by committing more government funds to healthcare, prioritizing maternal care and bringing medical resources to rural areas. For example, Malawi is one of just six countries in the African Union (AU) that has met and surpassed its health-spending target, according to UNAIDS. In 2001, the AU pledged to spend at least 15 percent of total government budget on health. Malawi has committed 18 percent to such spending.

A few days after I quit smoking weed for the first time, I started dreaming again and those dreams seemed more vivid than ever.

When asked if it's possible that the release date suggests Brock may be moved to another corrections facility, Jensen said, \"That would not be a possibility.\" \"If it says he's getting released on that date \u2014 unless there's some special circumstance and he receives new criminal charges while in prison and were to be charged \u2014 that is the date of his release,\" said Jensen. An unnamed representative from the same sheriff's office told TMZ that Turner is being held in \"protective custody\" away from any inmates who aren't also in protective custody, and will have an escort who will accompany him on prison grounds. According to the representative, Turner was eligible to receive these protections by virtue", "9 people who discovered just how terrible their exes really are. So if you're going through a breakup right now, we have the perfect support for you. A group of people have taken to anonymous confession website Whisper to share their moment of closure and sweet, sweet relief. Here are some of the best:   [I] Saw my ex on an episode of Cops. I dodged a bullet for sure. Found out my ex voted for Trump... Never been more glad we broke up. Got a bank statement for my ex. So glad we broke up. She is too old to be that shitty with money. My ex got matching name tattoos with her fiance\u0301 of three months.  My ex-boyfriend feared his future kids would turn out gay/lesbian. Thank God we broke up. I re-read screenshots from the end of my last relationship. I didn\u2019t realise how insane and borderline abusive my ex was at the time \u2013 so glad to say I\u2019m at least ten times happier now. I ran into my ex, who casually mentioned that he was high from Windex. I\u2019m so glad I ended that relationship. My ex-boyfriend thinks I \"got cancer\" to get his attention. Yes I gave myself cancer so you would pay attention", "There\u2019s one simple reason badminton is unequivocally the best Olympic sport to watch. I have a take. And it\u2019s not hot. Actually, it\u2019s not even a take, it\u2019s a fact. And that fact is that badminton is the best sport at the Olympic games. My colleagues Luke Kerr-Dineen and Nate Scott have tried to brainwash you into thinking that I have a take. And it\u2019s not hot. Actually, it\u2019s not even a take, it\u2019s a fact. And that fact is that badminton is the best sport at the Olympic games. My colleagues Luke Kerr-Dineen and Nate Scott have tried to brainwash you into thinking that equestrian and rugby sevens are the best, but they are very wrong and I am very right. Trust me, because I know about badminton. When I wasn\u2019t watching the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team lose to the Ikea-demons (aka Sweden) I have spent today transfixed by the badminton livestream. The speed with which these players move is truly staggering, and the fast-pace kept my attention which, in the age of multiple screens at multiple times, is no easy feat. I can\u2019t even make it through a full episode of Friends anymore without checking my phone. I am a true millennial disgrace. But I digress. What matters more than my embarrassing", "This Is Why Your Nose Looks Like It Does. When it comes to appearances, humans are probably the most diverse species on the planet, coming in all shapes and sizes. This goes as much for our faces as our bodies, and of course one of the most prominent items on the facial landscape is the schnoz. Differences in nasal design are thought to be driven by a number of evolutionary adaptations, such as the need for nostrils of a particular size in order to control the volume and temperature of inhaled air. The fact that humans tend to recognize each other by sight rather than smell (in most cases!) is another key driver of our wildly varying facey bits. Surprisingly, these enormous differences in nose shape and size are controlled by a rather small number of genes, which, according to the study authors, encode for specific characteristics such as nostril width, \"pointiness,\" and the inclination of the bridge of the nose. To discover this, the researchers looked at photographs of 6,275 people from across Latin America, cross-referencing these images with a full analysis of their genomes, obtained via a DNA sample. In particular, the study authors analyzed 14 different facial traits, seeking out any genetic similarities between people with similar", "A Temple In Mussoorie Did Something That Helps Save Water Without Breaking Tradition. Sanatan Dharma Mandir is one of the oldest temples of Mussoorie. Thronged by scores of devotees all through the year, the temple is frequented by many Shiva bhakts. As is tradition, people pour water over the lingam with vessels made from copper of various sizes. And this is what gave the temple authorities an idea to help save water without breaking tradition. According to this report in the TOI, the temple officials decided to replace all the larger vessels with those of smaller sizes.

They are gradually phasing out all the big and medium size vessels. The result is that everyone is happy, including environmentalists. The devotees continue to follow rituals and traditions, and the temple has sent out a strong message in water conservation. \"Symbolic gestures like these help spread awareness of the need for water conservation,\" the report quotes an environmentalist as saying.
