["GIF Billy Mitchell takes video games very seriously. He\u2019s been called one of the greatest arcade gamers ever, and there\u2019s even a documentary about his insane high score in Donkey Kong called The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. Even with his own full-length documentary film, Mitchell is still best-known for one thing: He was the first person to get a perfect score (3,333,360 points) in Pac-Man. Mitchell set the record in 1999, almost two decades after the game was originally released. \"You start off on the first board, and on board 21, that\u2019s where it reaches the maximum difficulty,\" Mitchell said in a recent interview about the achievement. \"You have to navigate all the way to board 255 doing the same repetitive thing. You can\u2019t miss a dot, a prize, a blue man. You can\u2019t die once.\" In the video, Mitchell explains how, at level 256, there\u2019s only enough memory in the game for the left-half of the board. The right-half of the game is filled with computer garble that looks something like the Matrix code. \"You get to the end, and there\u2019s nothing to do but die.\"", "You, like most people, probably want to avoid psychopaths . How do you steer clear? Well, if you've ever watched a horror movie, you'll know to stay out of dark woods, unlit alleyways, and to never, ever go into the basement to investigate that strange noise down there. Oh, and you should probably also avoid prison. But, sad to say, those steps are unlikely to be enough. Psychology tells us that psychopaths actually walk among us everyday. Research suggests something like 5 percent of people show psychopathic tendencies These folks aren't necessarily committing crimes, but this small but significant portion of the population does display some essential traits of psychopathy, like lack of empathy, selfishness, lack of guilt, and plenty of charm . And while it's true that there's really nothing you can do to ensure that you never have to deal with everyday psychopaths, apparently there is at least one way you could decrease your chances--you could avoid going into certain professions. According to a fascinating (if not exactly easily actionable) recent PsyBlog post, psychopaths aren't evenly scattered through the population . According to research done by psychologist Kevin Dutton called the Great British Psychopath Survey, some jobs seem to attract them and have higher than average numbers of psychopaths among their practitioners. And sorry, business leaders, you're not going to like which gig tops the list: CEO Lawyer Media (TV and radio) Salesperson Surgeon Journalist Police officer Clergyperson Chef Civil servant Some of these are more surprising than others. Who would have guessed the clergy are prone to psychopathy, for instance? Though, I guess, upon reflection, you could see how a job regarded as especially holy might attract those obsessed with their own importance. And I am, of course, personally shocked to see journalists here. (I look around at colleagues with newly suspicious eyes.) Also, how did politician not make the list? The other end of the scale is also interesting but perhaps offers fewer puzzlers. PsyBlog also offers a list of those jobs least likely to be taken by psychopaths, and, as you'd expect, most are intensely focused on empathizing with or caring for others.

The logic behind the Reddit user's final tally, in his words: \"I calculated how many bricks it'd take to build a 2400 square foot home, which is 117600 bricks. I then just took the cost of the Supreme brick, I made it 40$ to include the shipping and such. So, 117600 x 40 = 4,704,000.\" There are some holes in dude's math, though. First off, it'd be surprising if Supreme made more than 15,000 of these bricks in the first place. There's also a discussion on the price of the bricks, with some saying you wouldn't be paying shipping charges per brick, which would change the overall price. Either way, as one commenter noted , that's just for the bare house. One cold, non-WiFi-having, non-floor having abode. They then brought up an interesting point: \"I wonder if the resell price for bricks would affect the Supreme brick housing market. I mean you'd figure that a brick could very well go for like 60-70 resale if it's extremely hyped. That would make your house worth a little over $7 mil at $60 per brick. This might be a good business investment.\" What rich hypebeast is ready to see if Supreme would take $4.7 Ms out of their bank account to lay the foundation on this Supreme brick house?", "If you had $100,000 to shoot a music video but the star never showed up, what would you do? Pomp&Clout director Ryan Staake faced this dilemma on a shoot for rapper Young Thug's song \"Wyclef Jean.\" But, Young Thug never actually stepped foot on set. Rather than scrape together footage to create a makeshift video, Staake cleverly turned the whole situation on its head\u2014and the result is a highly entertaining, meta-masterpiece of a music video. The video starts with a conversation about the vision for the project, but it's quickly explained with interjected typed sentences, drawings and captions all describing how things went awry. Police presence on the shoot, changes in creative direction or behind-the-scenes glimpses at post-production edits are spelled out in the video\u2014all to the tune of Thug's \"Wyclef Jean.\" Fans appropriately freaked out on Twitter about the unexpected music video and disbelief that it actually was approved and released. Young Thug Wyclef Jean video is art. Director is a genius. \u2014 h (@halsey) January 17, 2017 Young Thug's Wyclef Jean music video is a masterpiece.

In fact, maybe that's the moral of this story: None of this matters....but you're still watching.\" And we'll probably watch again and again.

If you recall, we told y\u2019all about the Facebook tantrum Sinead O\u2019Connor had a few days ago, when she had made some strong accusations about Arsenio, Prince, and Eddie Murphy. In a nutshell Sinead claimed that Arsenio supplied Prince with the drugs that ultimately killed him and she even went as far as to say that Arsenio spiked her drink back in the day and that Arsenio is Eddie Murphy\u2019s and Prince\u2019s \"bit#h!\" That\u2019s pretty wild, right? Well Arsenio ain\u2019t taking too kindly to Sinead\u2019s Facebook rant, so he did what any sane person would do- he lawyered up and shot back at the \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" singer with a lawsuit that\u2019s large enough to buy everybody in Sinead\u2019s native country of Ireland one small value meal from a fast food joint... ARSENIO DROPS BIG $$$ LAWSUIT ON SINEAD O'CONNOR ARSENIO DROPS BIG $$$ LAWSUIT ON SINEAD O'CONNOR Arsenio just slapped Sinead O'Connor with $5MILLION lawsuit over her Prince rant and claims that Aresenio supplied the legendary Purple One with drugs that ultimately caused his death. I betcha next time she'll think twice before letting her typing fingers take off with a mind of their own on Facebook, LOL. Check out the details on the lawsuit:  via TMZ: 'Arsenio Hall just clapped back at Sinead O'Connor with a $5 MILLION defamation lawsuit over her claim he was fueling Prince's habit. His lawyers, Marty Singer and Lynda Goldman, filed the suit Thursday morning, in which Arsenio calls Sinead a \"desperate attention-seeker\" for posting an incendiary rant on Facebook earlier this week. She called Prince a \"longtime hard drug user\" who got his supply from \"Arsenio Hall (AKA Prince's and Eddie Murphy's bitch).\" In the suit, Arsenio flat out denies ever supplying Prince with illegal drugs -- and adds, he hasn't had contact with Sinead for 25 years. He also denies spiking her with drugs back in the day ... as she claimed. As for why she targeted him -- Arsenio says she's repeatedly said she met Prince a couple times and she \"detested\" him. She also says she told Prince \"to go f*** himself.\" Arsenio implies this is par for the course with Sinead, saying she is \"well known for her media antics and for seeking attention through inflammatory Facebook posts.\"'", "D.J.'s got moves! Of all the things viewers notice while binge-watching Fuller House this weekend, perhaps the one they'll least expect is this: Candace Cameron Bure (who is totally hilarious while reprising her role as D.J. Tanner) is great at the physical stunts. The show gets surprisingly physical in multiple episodes thanks to both choreographed dances and intense wrestling matches, and Bure did all the stunts herself, regardless of the fact that there was a professional stunt double on hand. \"That is me, every single move,\" Bure tells E!'s Kristin Dos Santos in the video above of a scene involving Mexican wrestling. \"They hired a stunt-woman, and they said, 'Don't worry, just watch her and we'll just kind of do close-ups of your face, she's going to do everything.' And when I watched her run through the routine the first time, I went, 'She's not doing it, I'm doing the whole thing!'\" Bure's Fuller House costars could do nothing but praise Cameron Bure's ass-kicking skills. \"It was amazing,\" Andrea Barber says. \"The reactions you see in the audience are genuine.\" The Mexican wrestling scene in particular even inspired Jodie Sweetin's Christmas present to Cameron Bure, which we are now definitely going to need proof of.", "Oregano may seem like an unlikely ingredient in the fight against climate change. But this modest herb could make cows\u2019 methane-heavy belches \u2014 a big contributor to the warming of our planet \u2014 a little less potent. Oregano\u2019s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow\u2019s rumen. Danish researchers who are investigating oregano\u2019s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows\u2019 methane emissions by a quarter. Nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle. NPR points out that oregano oil isn\u2019t the only solution to cutting down cows\u2019 ballooning emissions. Scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical. But those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows\u2019 methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk. We could just eat less dairy and beef. But while some Americans are starting to shift away from meat, that change may not happen soon enough. It might behoove us to get our cows chewing oregano cud, since that could be one small solution we could implement fast.", "While money can certainly provide you access to greater health care, it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re any less susceptible to illness than the \"average Joe\"- just ask some of the most famous celebrities in the world. In case you somehow believed that famous people don\u2019t get sick, here\u2019s a list of some of the world\u2019s most famous people who courageously battle chronic health ailments of various kinds... Pamela Anderson shared in 2002 that she had contracted Hepatitis C, an infectious disease that affects the liver, from ex-husband and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Tommy Lee. In 2011 and 2013, Catherine Zeta-Jones checked herself into Silver Hill Hospital to receive treatment for Bipolar II Disorder. She has been openly public about her battle with the psychiatric disorder in an effort to rid the disease of its social stigma. The actress who plays Haley on Modern Family was forced to undergo a kidney transplant in 2012 due to her battle with kidney dysplasia, also known as multicystic dysplastic kidney. The condition causes cysts to form on the kidney. The 35-year-old model and reality TV personality suffers from the autoimmune disease psoriasis, which causes red, itchy and scaly skin patches. Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks went public with his Type 2 diabetes diagnosis in 2013. His doctors believe the severe weight fluctuations from his acting career may have played a role in causing him to develop the disease. Trump underwent an appendectomy, which is performed when the appendix becomes inflamed due to bacteria and/or pus. Modern science hypothesizes that living without an appendix makes it notably harder to rid one\u2019s body of certain types of infection. Jon Hamm, the Golden Globe and Emmy award-winning star of Mad Men, suffers from a chronic skin condition called vitiligo. The condition is characterized by the death of skin pigment cells, and the consequent loss of skin pigment. Venus Williams is taking time away the tennis court due to her battle with Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome, a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease in which the body\u2019s moisture-producing glands are attacked by white blood cells. The 67th U.S. Secretary of State has suffered from fainting spells, concussions, and blood clots, as well as an underactive thyroid gland, for which she takes blood thinners and synthetic thyroid hormone replacement therapy, respectively. Miley Cyrus was born with tachycardia, a condition that causes a higher-than-normal resting heart-rate. Former President Bill Clinton has dealt with a number of heart hearth issues. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2004, and had two coronary stents placed in his heart in 2010. The winner of a record 28 Olympic medals, Michael Phelps is the most revered Olympic athlete of all time. It hasn\u2019t been easy however, as suicidal thoughts and alcoholism led to a diagnosis of clinical depression, followed up by time spent in a rehab facility. The Australian actor had two spots of skin cancer removed in 2013 and 2014, both from his nose. He expects these will not be the last spots to be removed. The TV star discovered during a regular cardiologist check-up that she has a leaky valve, which places extra strain on the heart and can cause congestive heart failure. In 2006, the award-winning singer-songwriter battled breast cancer with a lumpectomy, the removal of a piece of the breast, and radiation treatment. Crow has also been diagnosed with meningioma, a benign brain tumor that has thus far required no treatment. The U2 singer has had glaucoma since the 80\u2019s, and wears his sunglasses so often because his eyes are extremely sensitive to light. This famous NBC News anchor of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2013, a cancer that affects plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. The Dancing with the Stars winner was diagnosed with and underwent treatment for thyroid cancer in 2012. Thankfully the treatment was a success and she is now cancer-free! Bret Michaels has lived with Type 1 diabetes since he was six years old. More recently, he\u2019s dealt with a number of extreme medical issues, including a stroke in 2010. In 2001, actress Sharon Stone was hospitalized due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a form of stroke. The comedian and actress had a heart attack in 2012, and has since shifted to a whole-foods diet to improve her heart health. Michael Douglas was reported to have throat cancer in 2010, though a few years later Douglas clarified that it was actually tongue cancer. The son of metal legend Ozzy Osbourne was diagnosed in 2012 with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. The young pop-singer was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease lupus in 2014. She checked into rehab for chemotherapy treatment the same year.", "The LinkedIn Mistake That\u2019s Hurting Your Career Why is your colleague earning an extra $1,000-plus a month while you\u2019re still slaving away? It\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t do this. Most people talk about how to avoid mistakes in theory. They say if you don\u2019t do X, you won\u2019t get Y. But how does it play out in real life? Let\u2019s look at things from the perspective of the person who has the budget to hire. Recently, I went to hire three health writers. In my search for candidates, I thought it would be best to look in a place where health writers already existed. I picked a website called Everyday Health (Alexa rank: 2,831) as a good place to check out. The Job I looked at it like this: Everyday Health is a recognized site that covers health topics. They do research on their content. The stories are very consumer friendly. That hit requirement No. 1 for me, that they were vetted as an expert in their area. The second thing I was looking for was someone whom I could contact by email, so I could document our conversation and get a proposal from them. With that second criterion in mind, I wanted to see what writers contributed to the publication. Luckily, they place all their writers on the same page. On Everyday Health\u2019s contributing writer page, they had 110 writers listed. Well, let\u2019s break down how the profiles of these 110 writers. The Stats 25 of them didn\u2019t have links to a bio or website. Nine linked to an Everyday Health page, so chances are, they were staff members and faculty. One linked to their book on Amazon. Two led to dead links. One linked to Facebook. One linked to Google+. 37 linked to their LinkedIn pages. 33 of these pages only accepted inMail. The other four had a button to connect. Nine linked to their Twitter pages. Of these Twitter pages, six linked to their websites, but only four had a website with an email address. 25 linked to their website. Of these 25 websites, 21 of them had contact information or a form to fill out. Out of all 110 writers, I could only contact 25 of them by email. The Opportunity Did you know that, according to a study by Bankrate, 63 percent of Americans couldn\u2019t handle a $500 surprise bill? What if your washing machine broke? How about the transmission in your car? Or worse yet, if you were sent to the emergency room? An extra $500 a month in any household could go a long way, either to handle a surprise bill or to improve the quality of life. The three writers I\u2019m in the process of hiring will be earning significantly more than that. The Problem As I mentioned, I could only reach 25 of these 110 writers. That means that out of the 110 people who could have significantly improved the quality of their lives by being showcased as experts in their field, I was only able to contact 22 percent of them. Missing the Mark So 78 percent of these talented individuals completely missed out on that opportunity. Why? I had no way to contact them. The 37 people I could have contacted on LinkedIn, which most people feel is a business network, didn\u2019t hear a word from me. That\u2019s because when I went to their pages, I saw their re\u0301sume\u0301s and saw that these people were selling their professional services, but I only had two choices. Do I pay for LinkedIn Premium out of my own pocket just so I could send them an inMail, as I would have had to for 33 of them? Do I connect with the other four, yet lose their information among the other 7,000 LinkedIn connections I have? The problem here is that not a single one of these LinkedIn profiles had either a website or an email address listed anywhere on their site. I mean, I still had to calculate which writers matched our style and which ones fit within our budget. But 85 of these 110 individuals didn\u2019t even get a chance to be in the running, because they haven\u2019t invested in their professional brand. The Solution If you intend to work hard, set up your brand, and be featured as an expert, you need to see it through. The reason you are doing this is so you can get more work. Here I was, ready to hire, yet so many people missed the opportunity to be contacted. In fact, if these 37 people on LinkedIn did one thing differently and had their email addresses listed, 56 percent of these contenders could have contributed their bids as opposed to 22 percent. That increases your probability of getting hired by 34 percent! If you don\u2019t have your email addresses listed in an easily accessible place on your LinkedIn profile, or better yet, a professionally designed website, you are going to be losing income-earning opportunities every day. That needs to change. Optimize your Web properties and become easily accessible to others who are looking to hire you for your expertise. People like me aren\u2019t going to jump through hoops to try to give you money. We want you to be easy to access so we can start a dialogue to see if you are a good fit. Stop missing out on opportunities and start setting yourself up for success. Go out there and invest in building out your professional brand in the way it needs to be seen. Add that email address to your LinkedIn page, then get that website up and operational.", "The potential return of Georges St-Pierre has been speculated upon for months, but the biggest hint to date dropped earlier this week. The former welterweight champion, who semi retired in controversial fashion back in Nov. 2013 after going six years undefeated, is currently in the throws of a full fight camp, according to La Presse. The Canadian newspaper reported quotes that were given to Globe MMA by Georges\u2019 best friend and former cornerman Kristof Midoux, who verified that GSP is in camp right now. \"I will bring in sparring partners who will show him no deference,\" Midoux said. \"The best of the best, people who don\u2019t know him.\" After defeating Conor McGregor at UFC 196 Nate Diaz went on retired fighter Chael Sonnen\u2019s podcast to put forward his theory that GSP was in attendance at at the event to challenge McGregor in the event that the featherweight champ won. \"Yeah I heard (they were planning on having Conor call out GSP) but I put a big old hole in that shit. What did they think, that I\u2019m some game they can play? I can\u2019t be fucked with, I been in the game too long. They wanted to have this big old GSP vs. McGregor bullshit, with Georges sat in the front row at UFC 196, I don\u2019t even wanna hear about that shit. Get the fuck outta here with that. What the fuck? I pissed off Conor McGregor, I pissed off GSP, but most of all I pissed off the UFC. Well guess what? LOL motherfuckers. Georges is full of shit, he\u2019s a bully, he was going to fight this little Irish featherweight guy? He would have held him down, that\u2019s a freak show fight man.\" However, Midoux put the McGregor or Diaz rumors to bed and laid out the list of fighters GSP would like to face in the event of a comeback. \"Of course he\u2019s interested in avenging his performance versus Hendricks,\" Midoux said. \"He and I both know he did not lose that fight, but he did not exactly win it either. With that said, he\u2019s more interested in Lawler since he holds the title and beat Hendricks.\" Bring it on!", "She must be doing something right. That's what Russian activist Katya Romanovskaya thought after she awoke last week to find a giant wooden penis chained to her car.

The outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin shared a photo of the wooden penis on Facebook, commenting that her work was finally recognized. (Story continues below) Romanovskaya made headlines last year after it was revealed that she was one of two people behind Russian satire account @KermlinRussia. Along with Arseny Bobrovsky, Romanovskaya often posts pithy quips about the failures of the Russian government in the style of Stephen Colbert or Jon Stewart. Now it seems some pranksters -- perhaps supporters of Vladimir Putin -- have tracked down Romanovskaya and left her a present. The New Republic, which first reported the special delivery, writes: This is the kind of cockamamie (sorry) prank that reeks (sorry) of Nashi, the pro-Kremlin youth group founded after Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2005.

Norwegian professor Johan Galtung is known as the \"founding father\" of peace studies as a scientific subject and is recognised for correctly predicting numerous historical events, among them the Tiananmen Square uprising in China and the September 11 attacks. He attracted controversy in 2000 when he predicted US global power would collapse by 2025. But under the Bush administration he revised his forecast for the collapse to 2020. Now, he says that reality that is materialising following election of the bombastic billionaire. Mr Trump\u2019s election on an anti-immigrant platform coincides with one of the final phases of the decline predicted in the social scientist\u2019s 2009 book The Fall of the American Empire\u2014and then What? where he forecast the rise of facism before the country's power receded. The President-elect has vowed to deport three million illegal immigrants as soon as he enters office and build a wall along the American border with Mexico. He told Motherboard the election of Mr Trump \"speeds up the decline\", although he qualified the statement, saying: \"Of course, what he does as a President remains to be seen.\" Dr Galtung added that the President-elect's critical attitude to Nato also indicated the US would cease to be a superpower. The Republican has previously indicated the US might not come to the aid of those in the alliance if they failed to meet the designated defence spending. \"The collapse has two faces,\" Dr Galtung told the tech news site, \"Other countries refuse to be good allies and the USA has to do the killing themselves, by bombing from high altitudes, drones steered by computer from an office, special forces killing all over the place. \"Both are happening today, except for Northern Europe, which supports these wars, for now. That will probably not continue beyond 2020, so I stand by that deadline.\" Yet Xenia Wickett, head of the US and Americas programme at think-tank Chatham House told The Independent it was \"totally unrealistic\" to believe the US would stop being a global power by 2020. \"The US is a global power for many reasons. It has the strongest military in the world, it has the most robust soft power in terms of its universities, [...] in terms of its companies and in terms of the reach of its media. It also remains the biggest economy in the world. The idea that any of these things are going to change in the next four years is unrealistic.\"", "The Poke\u0301mon Go craze is sweeping across America. See how the game works, why everyone's so crazy about it, and all the stories that have come from it, from the game's positive impact on depression victims to armed robberies.

The meme: Poke\u0301mon Go What it is Poke\u0301mon Go is a (possibly overrated?) augmented-reality game that launched in the United States late last week. In a nutshell, the game lays a sort of semi-transparent Poke\u0301-world over your actual, geographical location, which you can explore by physically walking around while staring zombie-like at your screen. [The first Pokemon game for smartphones is not what I expected] Poke\u0301mon Go has some things in common with the Poke\u0301mon franchise that captivated kids in the late 1990s: As in those games, the objective is to find and capture mythical creatures called Poke\u0301mon, which can be upgraded and squared off against each other. Poke\u0301mon Go differs in a few key respects, though. For starters, as of this writing, there\u2019s no actual mission to work on or some big boss to beat \u2014 the point of the game is to amble around more or less aimlessly. You can\u2019t trade Poke\u0301mon yet, although that\u2019s allegedly coming, and features such as battling and training have been deliberately watered down. Go also has a wildly popular feature that allows you to take screenshots of Poke\u0301mon in the \"wild\" \u2014 i.e., on your desk, on a child\u2019s head or on your wife\u2019s hospital bed immediately before she gives birth. Those screenshots, which have blown up on Twitter and Reddit at a truly alarming rate, are critical to the appeal of the game.

It was supposed to become available in more countries from there, but so many people are already playing the game \u2014 overloading its servers \u2014 that international rollout has been paused indefinitely. Naturally, that is not stopping some determined players in Europe and elsewhere: It is possible to download Poke\u0301mon Go, no matter where you are, by changing your phone\u2019s region settings. [Poke\u0301mon Go craze sweeps nation: Players find monsters \u2014 and worse] Who started it Go was developed by Niantic, a company spun out from Google and known to many as the studio that previously brought you \"Ingress.\" That game is conceptually similar to Poke\u0301mon Go, in that you have to get out and explore the \"real world\" to play it. Niantic chief executive John Hanke explained his motivation this way in an interview with the New York Times last month: \"Everyone is spending all this time inside, by their computers. No one goes to the local parks. We wanted to do something that was aspirational: Let\u2019s get people outside. ... Part of the joy of the game is going off the beaten path. We\u2019re not about being strapped in a couch in \u2018The Matrix.\u2019\" How to play it as if you know what you\u2019re doing There are already a million guides to playing Poke\u0301mon Go out there, from Polygon\u2019s tips for the \"ultimate beginner\" to Game Revolution\u2019s \"advanced\" strategies. Regardless of where you fall on that spectrum, though, the best way to not look like an idiot while playing is to ... not look like you\u2019re playing. Seriously. (Others may think differently about this, but I was sort of embarrassed when a smug stranger in the park across from The Washington Post office sidled up to me and said: \"You\u2019re playing Poke\u0301mon, aren\u2019t you? EVERYBODY IS.\") To avoid such encounters, I suggest a dual strategy: One, find a viable cover for your phone-distracted wandering. (A dog is helpful here, as is any car ride in city traffic when you\u2019re sitting in the passenger seat.) Two, limit yourself to casual, incidental checks in public \u2014 of the kind you might usually deploy for your email or Facebook notifications. Added bonus: This will also help you avoid walking into people or suffering other accidents. A smart observation to make at your next nerdy dinner party More than a mobile game, Poke\u0301mon Go is sort of a massive-scale trial run for augmented-reality technology: a chance to get consumers used to the idea of interacting in mixed virtual and physical environments. The more people adopt it, the more situations like the one I described above \u2014 where it felt awkward to be called out for playing in public \u2014 will actually seem normal, even expected. As the co-founder of one augmented-reality company told NPR, \"I think this could be a real driver of early adoption and bringing people into the fold.\" And last but not least, further reading:", "So Yevette drove home, donned a plaid shirt, black pants, baseball hat and sneakers and topped it off with a false mustache. Then they went back to school, and Elijah was, wonderfully, able to take part in the Donuts with Dads event. Yevette took to Facebook later that day and posted, \"Today at my son Elijah\u2019s school, as I was dropping him off I asked him why there were so many cars. He said [it was] Donuts with Dad, so we quickly went back home cause I wasn\u2019t about to let him miss out.\" \"I know seeing other dads with their kids isn\u2019t easy for mine,\" she continued. She pragmatically added, \"But it\u2019s life, at least I can do whatever it takes to put a smile on that face.\" Yevette also shared pictures of her and her son with his friends at school. Of course, the pictures quickly went viral, not only among single parents in a show of solidarity, but also with dual parents lending their support. The story that the casually snapped selfie outside of the school does not tell, however, is that the mustachioed Yevette was filled with nerves. But seeing the beaming smile across her son\u2019s face reminded her of why she was doing what she was doing. After all, she didn\u2019t want to see Elijah miss out on anything just because her kid\u2019s dad isn\u2019t a part of their lives. So, with the pull of donuts apparently too strong for the Vasquezes to miss out on, they walked proudly into the school, Yevette wearing an outfit that Elijah had helped to assemble. However, the youngster\u2019s advice didn\u2019t end with the wardrobe. In fact, Yevette told Inside Edition, \"He kept saying, \u2018Walk like a man, mom. Walk like a man.\u2019\" Elijah may have been on the receiving end of some jibes from some other students, but he didn\u2019t care \u2013 he and his mom were in it together, and the smile on his face said it all. In fact, far from being embarrassed, he was happy that his mom went that extra mile just so he didn\u2019t miss out on the event. Most of the responses to the Facebook post, from fellow lone parents, dual-parents and those raised in a single-parent family, were positive too. Though Yevette did sense a slight bit of discomfort from some dads that morning, she later told CNN, \"Most of the dads thought it was really cool.\" One commenter on Facebook summed up the feelings of many when they wrote, \"I don\u2019t know you, but what I do know is your son\u2019s face tells it all! He loves you and this was a great thing you did. He might not have it all but he has everything in you. You\u2019re amazing!\" Many praised Yevette for playing both roles, while others acknowledged the strong values she instilled in her son. Another commenter wrote, \"When he has a family of his own I have no doubt in my mind he will remember this moment and strive to be the best dad he can be.\" The idea behind running initiatives such as Donuts with Dad is to get parents more involved with their kids. And while some critics may suggest that, for the sake of those who are left out, it\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t happen, Yevette herself disagrees. Speaking with Eye Opener TV, Yevette said, \"I\u2019ve gotten a lot of comments saying they should take these days away. I don\u2019t agree with that at all.\" Instead, she suggests a brother-sister day so that these kids feel they have \"every opportunity that everybody else does at school.\" Yevette\u2019s Facebook post so far has been shared more than 6,500 times, garnering more than 22,000 reactions. Yevette has also received messages of support from people from all over the world. The story has even run on major news outlets such as ABC, Today and CNN. All Yevette wanted, however, was a bit of fun so that her kid didn\u2019t miss out like so many times before. She told CNN, \"I saw that same sad look on his face and I didn\u2019t want that. I wish I would have done it sooner.\" And with two younger sons, she may get the chance to do it again.", "Why are some voices more attractive than others? It's complicated. Previous studies showed that men tend to prefer women with high-pitched voices, which are associated with high levels of estrogen. And women? They tend to prefer men with deep voices, which are linked with more testosterone. But new research suggests that we're also attracted to voices that are similar to our own -- because the similarity makes us feel that we're part of a certain social group. \"The voice is an amazingly flexible tool that we use to construct our identity,\" Dr. Molly Babel, a linguistics professor at the University of British Columbia in Canada and the lead author of the new study, said in a written statement. \"Very few things in our voices are immutable, so we felt that our preferences had to be about more than a person\u2019s shape and size.\" For the new study, Babel and her colleagues asked college-aged men and women in California to rate the attractiveness of 60 different voices (30 male, 30 female) belonging to people living west of the Mississippi River. The researchers found that many men and women preferred voices of people from their own regional area or community. \"The speakers we used were mostly from California, but some were from neighboring states,\" Babel told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Three of the voices came from as far away as Minnesota. The voices were variable because they covered this geographical and therefore dialectal range, but they were not immensely variable. There weren't any easy to (at least generically) identify southern U.S. accents or New York/New Jersey accents. The words that we used in our study also helped narrow down the variability, and were useful in illustrating the dialect range of our voices.\" For instance, the study subjects preferred female voices that pronounced the \"oo\" sound \u2014 as in the word \"goose\" \u2014 further forward in the mouth. That's typically a characteristic of West Coast speech. \"All of the listeners in our study were born and raised in California since at least toddlerhood, and were students at the University of California, Santa Cruz at the time of the study,\" Babel said in the email. \"So, our study is as much about the listener population as it is about the speaker population. What we found is that these Californian listeners had a preference for voices that exhibited typical sounding voices, but what exactly this means is different for the male and female voices.\" This study was published online in the journal PLOS ONE on Feb. 19, 2014.", "GTA V Player Uncovered A New Never-Before-Found Secret In-Game By dialing the secret phone number 1-999-367-3767, you\u2019re automatically connected to \"Black Cellphones\" and soon after an explosion is triggered (for reasons best known to the creators). What\u2019s more, doing this also changes the appearance of your cell phone. Totally makes sense (it doesn\u2019t). Another interesting thing to note is that this number wasn\u2019t present in-game when it was data-mined by players a while ago for secret phone numbers available. Could this mean Rockstar added this in as a cryptic hint to a upcoming GTA V DLC pack? We don\u2019t have any clear answers for now but we definitely have a video featuring the secret being uncovered. Watch it below \u2013", "Daniel Dopps is a chiropractor from Kansas and he has just had one of the most ridiculous ideas ever known to humankind. Ever. Dopps has invented Mensez, an adhesive \"lipstick\" that is applied to a woman\u2019s lady parts to block their menstruation. And it comes undone when the woman urinates. Yes, this man was clearly not at school when his class was taught about the female anatomy. In a post on Facebook, Mensez claims: Have you ever woke up with your lips stuck together? It didn\u2019t hurt and it was kinda fun. All you had to do was to wet your lips from the inside with saliva and they became unstuck. This is the principle behind Mensez. Mensez is a natural combination of amino acids and oil in a lipstick applicator that is applied to the lips downunder during the period. It causes them to stick together, strong enough to prevent leakage, that is until the user urinates. The urine instantly unsticks the labia and allows everything to wash out into the toilet. 'Simply wipe, and reapply,' it advises. In an even more bizarre turn of events, his product is patented.  Unfortunately for Dopps, he managed to alienate and insult his entire customer base with another Facebook post, where he wrote: Yes, I am a man and you as a woman, should have come up with a better solution than diapers and plugs, but you didn\u2019t. Reason being women are focused on and distracted by your period 25 per cent of the time, making them far less productive than they could be. He goes on to say that periods \"play with [women\u2019s] heads,\" and that periods can be \"gross, crusty, smelly and incredibly awful\".", "Madonna unloaded her thoughts about the presidential election, Donald Trump, ageism and her personal life in an interview with actress Elizabeth Banks for Billboard magazine published Monday. The 58-year-old pop icon said it felt like \"someone died\" after Trump defeated her preferred presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, in November. \"It felt like a \u00adcombination of the heartbreak and betrayal you feel when someone you love more than anything leaves you, and also a death,\" the singer told Billboard. \"I feel that way every morning; I wake up and say, \u2018Oh, wait, Donald Trump is still the president,\u2019 and it wasn\u2019t a bad dream that I had.\" \"It feels like women betrayed us. The percentage of women who voted for Trump was insanely high,\" she added, joining others who have criticized other women for voting for Trump, including actress Lena Dunham. Madonna\u2019s interview with Banks occurred just before her raunchy charity fundraiser in Miami, Florida but nearly a month after the presidential election. \"Women hate women. Women\u2019s nature is not to support other women. It\u2019s really sad,\" the \"Material Girl\" said. Madonna\u2019s support for Clinton was no secret. The singer had promised to perform oral sex on anyone who had voted for the Democratic presidential candidate. Just days before Election Day, Madonna implored her 8.3 million Instagram followers to \"vote Clinton or we are all F*CKED.\" She believes women failed to vote for Hillary out of \"jealousy\" and \"some sort of tribal inability to accept that one of their kind could lead a nation.\" \"Other people just didn\u2019t bother to vote because they didn\u2019t like either candidate, or they didn\u2019t think Trump had a chance in the world,\" Madonna said. \"They took their hands off the wheel and then the car crashed.\" The election results left Madonna \"devastated, surprised, in shock,\" she said, adding: \"I haven\u2019t really had a good night\u2019s sleep since he has been elected. We\u2019re f*cked.\" The singer said she met Trump 20 years ago during a photo shoot at the President-elect\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. \"He\u2019s a very friendly guy, \u00adcharismatic in that \u00adboastful, macho, alpha-male way,\" Madonna said of meeting Trump. \"I found his political incorrectness amusing. Of course, I didn\u2019t know he was going to be running for \u00adpresident 20 years later.\" However, she still doesn\u2019t think people like Trump should be \"heads of state.\" \"I just can\u2019t put him and Barack Obama in the same \u00adsentence, same room, same job description,\" she said. \"We\u2019re the laughing stock of the universe right now. We can no longer criticize other governments, other leaders. I\u2019m hanging my head in shame.\" Elsewhere in the the lengthy interview, Madonna railed against agism in the entertainment industry. \u2018Relevance\u2019 is a catchphrase that people throw out because we live in a world full of discrimination. Age is only brought up with regard to women,\" she said. \"It\u2019s connected to sexism, chauvinism and misogyny.

Well, to people who are educated and are not chauvinists or \u00admisogynists, yes.\"", "If your experience in the dating world isn't at least a little bit awkward, you're doing something wrong. Especially in a relationship that's only a few months old, there are bound to be hurt feelings, and embarrassment, and confusion. When do you tell the person you're seeing that you'd like to be exclusive? Or that you're just not into them anymore? There are no easy answers, and we're not pretending to have them. But for some nuanced insight, we consulted relationship expert Andrea Syrtash, author of \"It's Okay to Sleep With Him on the First Date,\" about how to navigate some of the most uncomfortable dating scenarios. Read on for Syrtash's top tips on dating with confidence. The awkward situation: You want to ask someone you just met on a date What to say: \"I would love to get to know you. Would you be open to going out for a drink with me?\" Before you extend the invitation, Syrtash recommended looking for a ring or any other indicators that the person is currently unavailable. But if you can't see anything, don't ask, \"Are you single?\" They'll let you know. Make sure to be confident and friendly keep your body language open and maintain eye contact. In this situation, your delivery is just as important as your language, Syrtash said.  Remember: Worst-case scenario, they'll decline, and you'll probably never see them again. The awkward situation: You want to ask a good friend on a date What to say: \"I need to tell you something and I feel a bit vulnerable right now. I would love to take you on a romantic date \u2014 not a friend date \u2014 and just see what happens. Would you be up for that?\" This scenario is a bit more high-stakes than asking out a total stranger, because you don't want to jeopardize your friendship. That's why Syrtash recommends trying to suss out whether your friend might be interested in you, too. For example, if they only invite you over to build furniture and they're always talking about their crushes, you might want to ask yourself if it's really a good idea to ask them out. Another tactic Syrtash recommended is dropping subtle hints before inviting them on a date. Start with some gentle touching \u2014 maybe put your hand on the small of their back \u2014 and try to be a little more flirtatious. See how they respond. The awkward situation: You're not sure who should pay on a first date What to say: Nothing. Syrtash advised against talking explicitly about who's going to pay. (It kind of kills the romance.) In general, Syrtash believes that whoever initiated the date should pay. The other person should accept graciously. Interestingly, among her clients, she's noticed that most women who date men do still expect the man to pay. If you expect the other person to pay but you're planning the date, try to pick a place that isn't so expensive so you won't feel guilty when your date foots the bill. Syrtash suggested arranging a date over happy hour drinks. When the bill arrives, even if you expect the other person to pay, you should still offer to pay and know that your date might agree to split the cost. And if your date does end up paying, make sure to thank them \u2014 even if you weren't feeling a romantic connection. The awkward situation: You'd like to be exclusive with the person you're seeing What to say: \"I really enjoy spending time with you and I'd love to do it more. I'm not comfortable if you're sleeping with other people and I figure that's worth bringing up now. How do you feel?\" Syrtash cautioned that it's not a great idea to have this conversation on a first or second date. But once you feel like you two are \"dating\" \u2014 whatever that means to you \u2014 it's okay to bring it up. Remember: The person can't read your mind. The key here is to stay positive and to confidently assert your needs \u2014 instead of being accusatory or putting the other person on the defensive. So don't say something like, \"Don't waste my time.\" The awkward situation: You feel like the person you're dating wants more from the relationship than you do What to say: \"I'm having so much fun and I want to be open about the fact that I'm still dating others and I hope you are, too.\" You don't need to give a long explanation for why you're dating other people, Syrtash said. But be prepared for your statement to open up a bigger conversation. The person might get defensive: \"Well, I'm not looking for [an exclusive relationship] either!\" Or, the person might tell you they were hoping to be exclusive \u2014 in which case, that's good to know now.The awkward situation: You're not sure how to tell family and friends that you and your partner met through a dating app What to say: \"We met through an app and hit it off.\" Plain and simple. If people get uncomfortable, Syrtash said, that's their problem \u2014 not yours. There shouldn't be a stigma attached to online dating. Again, it's all about staying confident. If you say it sheepishly, Syrtash said, you're inviting more awkwardness than is necessary. The awkward situation: You run into an ex while you're out with your new partner What to say: \"This is super awkward, but my ex is here. Can we move? I just don't feel like talking to him/her.\" The bottom line here is that you don't need to invite your ex into your date, Syrtash said. Either exchange brief greetings or move so your ex can't see you. There's no need to cause drama. When you let your current partner know that your ex is in sight, you can even laugh and make a joke about it \u2014 hence the phrase, \"This is super awkward.\" Either way, be aware that this situation might open up a conversation with your new partner about your last relationship. The awkward situation: You just called your partner your ex's name What to say: Laugh and make a joke. If this has happened once or twice, don't overthink it, Syrtash said. Laugh and move on, or don't acknowledge it if you think your partner didn't even notice. If it's happening all the time, you might want to ask yourself what that's really about. The awkward situation: Someone's breaking up with you after a few months, and it's a total surprise What to say: \"I was on a different page. It would be helpful for me to know how long you've been feeling this way.\" Syrtash emphasized that there's no one, blanket statement that can make a breakup less awkward for the person on the receiving end. Even if you do have a stock answer ready for the moment, you'll probably be so upset that it won't come out right. But Syrtash said it's okay to ask some questions, such as the one about how long the person has known they wanted to break up with you or, \"Can you identify why you don't think we're compatible?\" It's also okay to express that you're feeling disappointed. At the same time, it's not always appropriate to ask, \"Is there someone else?\" You may not get an honest answer. The awkward situation: You're breaking up with someone after a few months What to say: \"You deserve to be with someone who brings out the best in you. I don't think we are bringing out each other's best.\" Another option here is: \"I want the best for you and I don't feel that I can provide it. I feel awful because I care about you a lot, but I need to be honest.\" Oftentimes, Syrtash said, when someone's getting broken up with, their instinct is to show the other person how great they are. Remind them that you're not bringing out their best, and that the relationship isn't healthy for either of you. As hard as this is for you, remember that it's hard for the other person, too. That's why it's important to be patient, and to listen and be kind.", "Decide for yourself if Rotten Tomatoes is always right, or if it just really likes animated animals and indie films... Rotten Tomatoes has been on every movie fan\u2019s lips this month, as Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice opened, and currently sits at a brutal 29% on the site. Although fans gave the flick an audience score of 71%, the rotten rating has been getting a lot of attention, with 209 of the 293 critic reviews counted landing in the \"rotten\" camp. Ouch. Since the site launched in 1998, it\u2019s \"tomatometer\" has been aggregating critic reviews (and audience opinion) to let fans know if the overall response has been positive or negative \u2013 it\u2019s a system that isn\u2019t without flaws, but it\u2019s a solid starting point when considering critical reception. But with a box office smash like Batman V Superman coming in so low, we have to wonder which films managed to wow critics enough for a near-perfect rating. Read on for 10 Movies That Got 100% On Rotten Tomatoes (And A Few That Got Close). The Rules: Because it\u2019s hard to gauge critic reaction in retrospect or on a handful of reviews, we are looking at only those films which were released after the site launched in 1998. Many older movies, particularly those deemed to be classics, have 100% but no doubt would have faced more criticism upon their release. All of these films have over 100 critic reviews included. We\u2019re also including films with a 99% rating.  10 Shaun The Sheep Movie (99%) This madcap British comedy is one in a long line of spinoffs based on the hit claymation comedy series Wallace and Gromit. Shaun the Sheep became the star of his own TV series in 2007, which led to the full-length film Shaun The Sheep Movie in 2015. The plot itself is fairly simple, with plenty of room for classic Wallace and Gromit-style plots and slapstick. The sheep, bored of the same old routine, trick their farmer into falling asleep, but wind up giving him amnesia in the big city! The sheep and the farmer\u2019s faithful dog have to try and find a way to give their farmer back his memory so that he can come home. It\u2019s funny, fast-paced, and while there is plenty of silliness to it, you have to appreciate an entire caper, written entirely without dialogue. 9 Leviathan (99%) A bleak drama, Leviathan manages to avoid many of the pitfalls associated with foreign films that seek to make a point. Set in Northern Russia, the film centers on a family whose land and home is going to be taken from them by the corrupt local mayor, unless they (and an old friend who is now a lawyer) are able to stop him. Unlike the traditional underdog story, Leviathan does not guarantee us a feel-good ending, but is instead a stunning look at the rotting heart of a society in despair. Beautiful, moving, and Oscar-nominated, not even the depressing subject matter (or the subtitles) can detract from how good this film is. 8 Gloria (99%) Another film festival favorite, Gloria is an uplifting and poignant story of starting again in middle age. Set in Santiago, it centers on the recently divorced Gloria (Paulina Garcia) and her whirlwind love affair with a former naval officer. Garcia\u2019s performance is one of the highlights of the film \u2013 as is seeing a movie revolve around the kind of character that is all too rare in American cinema. At the end of the day, Gloria\u2019s journey is not about the love that she seeks with men in clubs, but the love that she develops for herself. Fun, inspiring and bursting with vitality, Gloria is beautiful and hopeful through and through. 7 Zootopia (99%) Everyone has been raving about Zootopia in recent weeks, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. This adorable tale (or should that be tail?) is Disney magic at its best. In a perfect society of anthropomorphic animals, predator and prey get along just fine... until someone goes savage, and it\u2019s up to new cop on the block Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) to solve the case. Of course, there\u2019s more to it, with an inclusive message coming from Judy\u2019s species \u2013 as the first bunny cop, she\u2019s got a lot to prove. Full of hilarious references for the grown-ups, it\u2019s a slam dunk of an animated film. With an audience rating of 95%, clearly everybunny loves Zootopia. 6 A Separation (99%) A riveting thriller-style drama about a marriage falling apart, A Separation is another film festival darling from 2011. Set in Iran, it centers on a husband and wife who love each other, but who file for divorce when the mother wants to leave the country with their daughter to give her a better life, and the husband cannot bring himself to leave his father who has Alzheimer\u2019s. When the two separate, the husband becomes embroiled in a legal battle with the woman who he hired to take care of his father, and their lives fall further apart. It\u2019s a moving look at very real and flawed characters, complex and nuanced. Critics and audiences alike loved it, with an audience rating of 92%. 5 Man on Wire (100%) This 2008 documentary about tightrope walker Philippe Petit and his famous stunt in 1974 wowed critics and audiences alike (with an audience rating of 87%). Combining an artistic stunt and a criminal caper, his story winds from the conception to the execution of a plot to string a tightrope wire between the roofs of the Twin Towers \u2013 and perform an act on that wire for nearly an hour. The film is a masterpiece of tension, yet hugely irreverent and exhilarating at the same time. Man on Wire is a joy to watch, and Petit\u2019s adventure will win your heart. Man on Wire is everything that a documentary should be. 4 Finding Nemo (99%) Another Pixar offering to receive a near-perfect rating, it is no surprise that Finding Nemo makes it onto this list. The only real surprise is that it took quite so long to get a sequel! This fun, fishy adventure is absolutely uplifting. From the father who develops his confidence to the new friend who figures out how to live life in more than three-second spurts, to the kid at the heart of it all, everyone gets to be a better version of themselves in the end. The characters are engaging, the writing is full of clever gags and subtle nods, and the action keeps us glued to the screen. With an audience score of 86%, we can only hope that Finding Dory does just as well. 3 Selma (99%) Based on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s fight for equal voting rights in 1965 after the end of segregation. Centered on the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama that led to the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the film is a gripping biopic that received almost unanimous acclaim. David Oyelowo gave a stunning performance as Dr Martin Luther King Jr, with a storyline that is nuanced and passionately written. Many critics also mentioned how well the film dealt with where we are today, and paid homage to Dr King\u2019s legacy without diminishing the progress that still needs to be made. Audiences agree that this powerful film is a must-watch, giving it an 86%. 2 Short Term 12 (99%) With 35 wins across the film festival circuit of 2013, Short Term 12 is a movie that deserved far more mainstream attention than it got at the time. Brie Larson gives a standout performance as Grace, a young supervisor at a group home for at-risk teens. Between her personal journey with her co-worker and partner Mason (John Gallagher Jr) and the struggles of the young people under her care, the audience is taken on an emotional rollercoaster that ends in hope. A film filled with warmth and heart, Short Term 12 pulls no punches with an incredibly difficult subject. Indie filmmaking at its best. 1 Toy Story (100%) The filmed to launch the juggernaut that is Pixar, everybody can agree that Toy Story is a modern classic. Based on childhood fantasies of toys coming to life when humans aren\u2019t around, Toy Story mixes nostalgia with a classic buddy comedy, set to catchy tunes and in a brand new format (at the time). Critics applauded its charm, its narrative, its clever writing and its heart, and audiences agreed (giving it an audience score of 92%). What\u2019s even more impressive is that the entire Toy Story trilogy made it into the Tomatometer top lists, with Toy Story 2 getting 100%, and Toy Story 3 dipping only slightly to 99%.", "Linda Burkhardt was killed by a drowsy driver on her way home from Christmas shopping on December 7, 2012. Her daughter, Ana Burkhardt, 31, of Sumner, Washington, shared her story with The Huffington Post in honor of Drowsy Driving Prevention Week. My mother had been out Christmas shopping for her two very young grandchildren. At the time, one was 4 months and one was 4 years old. She was on her way home when the other driver fell asleep at the wheel after she had left a party. That driver has admitted to the police that she knew she was drowsy when she left the party. The crash happened at 9:41 p.m. Police came to my sister's house, and she notified me. My mom was 55. Prior to the accident, I didn't know anything about drowsy driving. I'm trying to get the word out, by connecting with other families who have lost someone to this. I emailed and called county officials about putting up a sign in memory of my mom [at the site of the accident]. Eventually they told me they would do that and that we could watch them put it up. I also requested other changes. I asked for rumble strips to be put in, and they're working on that now. They repainted the lines on the road, they put in road turtles [raised pavement markers] in the center lanes, and they added signs warning of approaching intersections. It's a very windy, 50 mile-per-hour road. I know by making changes on that road, I've saved someone's life or made someone think they should be more responsible on the road. I would like the law to state that when a drowsy driver admits to being drowsy before they even start driving, they need to be held responsible just as a person who was drinking and driving is. They need to be given more than a fine ... for maiming or killing an innocent person. My sister Alicia and I lost our mom before we were even 30 years old. That driver took Mom away from us. The greatest thing in my mother's life was her grandchildren. She never got to see her granddaughter start school or her grandson's first steps. It breaks my heart that I'll have to explain to my son when he asks, \"Who is the lady in the pictures of me when I'm an infant?\" How do you explain that to a child? She was there for his birth and then there was just so little time.", "Donald Trump just loves to talk endlessly about how much he respects and supports military veterans. Of course, most of that is just lip service he pays so he can appear to be patriotic and get in good with potential voters and Republicans who are so fond of sending members of the armed services to fight endless wars. Earlier this week, Trump held a rally rather than attend the GOP debate because he was afraid of facing questions from Fox News host Megyn Kelly. He trumpeted the fact that he had raised some $6 million for veterans. And he then promptly put the money in a foundation that only he controls. But before the debate-avoidance event, a vet group in Queens that helps homeless veterans wrote and But before the debate-avoidance event, a vet group in Queens that helps homeless veterans wrote and requested some funding from the Donald for their cause.

And it will very likely make you angry as well:", "Donald Trump's children say they're not registered to vote in New York's April 19 primary. How did that happen? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) When Donald Trump went on \"Fox and Friends\" on Monday morning, he shared some strange news: Two of his children, Ivanka and Eric, won't be able to vote for him in New York's April 19 Republican primary. Wait, really? How did that happen? In the most basic terms, they missed the registration deadline. But while the three Trumps have spent the week saying they \"didn't register to vote\" in time, it's actually a little bit more complicated than that. Ivanka has said several times that she's a registered independent, because she prefers to vote for individual candidates over broader party platforms. Her brother Eric has also indicated he's registered as an independent. The problem for them is that New York has very restrictive laws around switching one's party affiliation. While new voters were permitted to register up until March 25 \u2013 less than a month before the primary \u2013 the deadline for switching party affiliations was way back on October 9 of last year. That still doesn't mean it would have been tough to make the switch to the party that, you know, their dad will probably represent as presidential nominee. As an experiment, I went through the whole process at my desk this morning. It involved printing out a PDF document (which New Yorkers can pick up from county election board offices or some state agencies), then filling it out by hand. It took two minutes, to the second (full disclosure \u2013 I didn't fill it out with my real information. My name isn't \"John Post,\" and my Social Security number certainly doesn't end in \"1-2-3-4.\") Yes, New York has some weird deadlines for switching party affiliation. And yes, any one of us could have made the mistake that Eric and Ivanka Trump did. But most of us aren't the children of major party candidates for president. As The Fix's Philip Bump wrote on Monday, the Trump campaign has an organization problem, from the delegate battle right on down. If his own kids \u2013 who, by their own admission, have participated quite actively in this campaign \u2013 can't get voter registration right, it could be a sign that the rest of the Trump campaign is seriously lacking in organization, too.", "Scams can be so lucrative that they're even attractive to drug dealers.

The FCC said scheme participants told DEA agents the companies were set up to bill thousands of consumers, mostly small businesses, for a $9 monthly directory assistance service on their local AT&T landline phone bills.

The Sonoma Marsh Restoration Project is a 20-year-long endeavor by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the California Coastal Conservancy and the California Department of Fish and Game to revitalize a nearly 10,000-acre network of wetlands and connected habitats. According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state purchased the land in 1994 from Cargill Salt Co., which had used the area as artificial salt ponds, driving out the natural habitants not suited to the water's highly saline conditions. Almost completed,the Sonoma Marsh Restoration Project is the Bay Area's largest wetlands restoration project ever undertaken, the San Jose Mercury News reports. \"It's a stunning achievement,\" Marc Holmes, program director of the Bay Institute, a participating environmental group, told the Mercury News. \"It's a phenomenal ecological restoration, one of the most important coastal wetlands projects ever done in the United States.\" Upon completion, the project will have restored habitats for some of the area's special status mammals and birds, namely the salt marsh harvest mouse, California clapper rail, and black rail as well as some endangered fish, incluidng the Delta smelt, Sacramento splittail, steelhead trout, Chinook salmon and the Dungeness Crab. One of the project's final steps, a $10 million, 3.4-mile pipeline, was celebrated Friday for its completion, the Press Democrat reported. The pipeline will bring recycled, treated water from the Sonoma Valley sewage plant to the wetlands The 550 million gallons a year the pipeline transfers into the former salt ponds will aid in diluting the area's bittern, a highly saline byproduct of salt-making, the Mercury News reports.", "Since he announced his bid for the presidency in June 2015, Donald Trump steadily accrued the support of a number of celebrities \u2014 some of whom are more notable than others.

Pete Skomoroch, founder of early-stage startup Skipflag and formerly a principal data scientist at LinkedIn, called the search engine-powered Google Assistant \"the best I\u2019ve ever used.\" Other people in the bot ecosystem, like Matrix Partners investor and former Facebook Parse cofounder Ilya Sukhar, have had similarly rosy things to say about Allo. \"Allo\u2019s assistant seems best in class. Everything else is meh,\" Sukhar tweeted shortly after the release of the chat app. This is the beginning, said Google vice president of engineering Scott Huffman, the \"first time you\u2019re able to have conversation with Google.\" This virtual assistant has the power to answer questions, perform translations, or plan a night out, and it is already embedded in Allo. But in the coming months it will also become part of Google Home and a true competitor to Amazon Alexa and other virtual assistants inside devices. Allo\u2019s release comes at a time of rapid change and investment in chat apps. The race to the killer bot If you haven\u2019t followed along, here\u2019s where we are in the chat wars. In the span of less than six months, Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft \u2014 hands down some of the biggest tech companies in the world \u2014 either launched a bot platform for their chat app, gave developers access to their platform so they can make their own bots, or, in the case of Google, created a new chat app. Since April, tens of thousands of developers have created bots for Facebook Messenger, Kik, Slack, and the like. But none of these has been a breakout hit, the one that \u2014 like a rising tide \u2014 has the potential to lift the collective boats of virtual assistants and the bot ecosystem in general. In short, there\u2019s been no killer bot \u2014 until Google Assistant. Microsoft\u2019s Tay had potential to be a killer bot. But it turned out to be a racist, sexist jerk that smoked weed in front of the police. We checked: There are no plans for Tay to make a return at this time, a Microsoft spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. It\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison, exactly, Tay and Google Assistant. Tay was made to be more conversational than what we\u2019ve seen from Google Assistant so far, but Tay was derived from Xiaoice, a bot made by Bing researchers that has the ability to do many of the things Google Assistant can do today. So it could be that Google \u2014 the last of the tech giants to show us its consumer-facing chat client for the coming chat wars \u2014 has built the first killer bot. What Google Assistant gets right Already downloaded 10 million times on Android, Allo and its Google Assistant are not without flaws, but here are a few things they do get right. First, Google Assistant leverages the powerful search capabilities that made Google a verb and a multi-billion dollar company. As my colleague Emil Protalinski described it, Google Assistant is \"like chatting with Google Search and Google Now in one.\" Second, Allo appears to fundamentally understand the importance of group chat. Want to send a new message with Allo? Before you see Incognito Mode, Google Assistant, or your friends, you see \"Start a new group chat.\" The ability to operate a bot within a group immediately gives Allo an advantage over platforms like Facebook Messenger, which does not allow bots to chat in groups. While in group chat, you can do Google searches together, look for a restaurant together, play group games, and, it appears, do anything else Google Assistant can do. This will be even more powerful when Google Assistant can make purchases, schedule appointments, or complete tasks for a group. Another standout feature: Smart Reply. Over time, Google Assistant promises to suggest responses based on the way you speak and your response to thumbs-up / thumbs-down surveys, given at the end of each query. More than generic common answers, Google Assistant learns your lingo and common responses. One more plus: Google Assistant may not be the only bot on Allo for long. The race to conversational commerce A day before the public launch of Allo, Google announced the acquisition of API.ai, a platform for building bots and virtual assistants through chat platforms and devices. This suggests that Google Assistant may operate alongside other bots made for the Allo platform. API.ai is currently used by more than 60,000 developers. \"API.ai offers one of the leading conversational user interface platforms, and they\u2019ll help Google empower developers to continue building great natural language interfaces,\" Huffman wrote in a blog post. Google\u2019s efforts underscore what exactly is up for grabs in this high-stakes game. Chat apps like Messenger and Line and WeChat and Kik have become some of the largest platforms in the world, larger than social media, and they\u2019re now seen as a way to deliver goods and services. More than 20,000 bots have been made for Kik, tens of thousands have been made for Microsoft and Facebook, and developers appear to be very receptive to Apple\u2019s recent launch of iOS 10 and an App Store for iMessage. Since the launch of iOS 10 a little over a week ago, more than 1,600 stickers or app extensions have been created for iMessage. These tech giants are beginning to build ecosystems around their platforms and their hundreds of millions of monthly active users. Even companies like Oracle and LinkedIn \u2014 companies not really associated with chat \u2014 launched bot initiatives in past weeks. This conversational commerce epiphany, and the stampede by U.S. tech giants to open platforms to third-party developers is happening in large part because of what WeChat has already accomplished in China. People use WeChat to shop, pay for services like utility bills, and speak to businesses (as well as friends). The ubiquitous app uses QR codes to bring commerce into the offline world. It\u2019s the most popular messaging app in China, and last week WeChat parent company Tencent announced that the chat platform has started to test use of xiaochengxu, or Little Program. Little Program will allow WeChat users to download and use apps inside WeChat, similar to iMessage. Conversational commerce has been achieved in China because users can have new experiences, pay for things, and socialize with the world from inside WeChat itself. Much of what you need to do on a daily basis \u2014 split a bill, put money in a savings account, make purchases in the offline world \u2014 can be done without needing to jump into a webpage or another app. But that\u2019s not how Allo works. Where Allo falls short Want the latest headlines in Allo? You\u2019ll see the top three results. Tap \"More\" and you\u2019re brought out of the app and onto the mobile web. Want to watch a YouTube video on Allo? You\u2019re brought to the YouTube app. Want to watch a YouTube video when using iMessage? You watch the video inside iMessage. Upon its release, Google said Allo was made to solve the problem that happens every time you need to leave the app. This is the problem that arises when you\u2019re chatting with a friend in order to figure out what you want to do tonight and need to search for a restaurant or check movie times. If the purpose of Allo is to solve this problem, it\u2019s going to need to do more inside Allo. Building conversational commerce for a platform is largely about providing a holistic experience within a single chat app. Today Allo\u2019s experience stitches together aspects of the Google suite of apps, web search, and the chat app. In the chat wars ahead, if other messaging app companies manage to get their own ecosystems operating primarily inside their apps \u2014 doing away with the need to leave to talk to a business, add a friend to the conversation, or buy groceries \u2014 they stand a good chance of converting users. It may only be the beginning for Allo and the chat wars, but whether Allo succeeds or not may depend on how much of the Allo experience is woven together from web searches and the suite of Google apps, and how much of it operates within Allo.", "Sales of battery-based vehicles have lagged well behind industry expectations, but there's a silver lining for manufacturers: Buyers of these vehicles are younger and more affluent than drivers who purchase comparable gas-powered models. But for many drivers, going green wasn't the only reason to choose electric. According to research by auto data firm TrueCar.com, many electric vehicle buyers were attracted by the deals being offered by such manufacturers as Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Honda as they try to build momentum in the category. The Ford Focus offers a bit of insight into the divide between traditional and electric car owners. A typical buyer of the model's conventional, gasoline-powered vehicle is 46 years old and has a household income of $77,000. The Focus Electric, however, is typically purchased by a 43-year-old with a household income of $199,000. That pattern repeats itself across the industry, according to TrueCar. Buyers of the electric Fiat 500e average 45 years of age and have a household income of $145,000. That\u2019s twice the money of a conventional Fiat 500 buyers\u2014and two years younger, on average. For the U.S. auto industry on the whole, the typical buyer is 52 years old with an $86,000 household income, Krafcik said. Based on the manufacturer suggested retail price, battery-based vehicles typically cost more than comparable gas models. But that gap is closing as manufacturers drive down the cost of the green technology\u2014and often swallow much of the premium in order to boost demand. Not all battery-car buyers are looking for a bargain, however. Tesla has never run incentives on its Model S sedan, which can cost upwards of $100,000.", "Plain seltzer or sparkling water\u2019s lack of sugar, calories, added colors or artificial flavors and its relatively low acidity makes it a generally healthy choice compared to most beverage options on the market, including most sodas, juices and sports drinks. But check the product label to avoid added sweeteners or sodium or other additives. Seltzer is water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide added to give it bubbles. Sparkling water is the umbrella term for carbonated water, including naturally carbonated sparkling mineral water and artificially carbonated seltzer and club soda. Studies have not shown ill health effects from drinking seltzer or other plain sparkling waters. 2006 study found an association between drinking colas and low bone mineral density. But the association was not seen in those who drank other carbonated beverages. Colas, with their low pH (a measure of acidity), also have the potential to erode tooth enamel. But a study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that the pH of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel. Carbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said Dr. John Ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, who co-authored the paper. \"It\u2019s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that\u2019s in your classic soft drinks that the pH can drop below the critical pH of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome. For example, Coca-Cola has a pH of about 2.4,\" making it potentially over 100 times more erosive than sparkling water (because pH is on a logarithmic scale). Bottled seltzers that have been flavored with citric acid, the acid found naturally in citrus fruits like lemons and limes, may be acidic enough to damage enamel. But you can get flavor in a less acidic form by adding a slice of lemon or lime (or other fruits, vegetables or herbs, such as cucumber, mint or basil) to plain sparkling water. According to a spokesman from the American Dental Association, the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water. In-home sparkling water makers, such as SodaStream, have gained popularity in recent years because they save money and have environmental benefits, but an additional advantage of making your own sparkling water from the tap may be the fluoride, which the ADA emphasizes is essential for maintaining long-term oral health. An additional health note: Club soda, which contains added sodium to mimic the taste of mineral water, is not the same as seltzer. The amount of sodium can be small and varies by brand, but it can add up if consuming many servings. Too much sodium can increase blood pressure, and current sodium levels among most Americans are already considered too high.", "The kinds of stories that scar you for life.

The watchful paintings. \"This has creeped me out ever since I heard it: One night there was a man walking alone in the woods. He noticed that it was getting dark outside and he needed to find a place to sleep. Eventually he came across a cabin and decided it would suffice. When he went in, he noticed that the walls were covered with paintings of people and their eyes seemed to be following him. It freaked him out a little, but since it was late he decided to ignore it and go to sleep. When he woke up in the morning, he noticed that the paintings were gone and there were only windows...\" \u2014Emily Benjamin, Facebook 2.

The girl was getting nervous and asked her boyfriend if they could leave, but then the car wouldn\u2019t start. Since this was the time before cell phones, the boyfriend had to go out to find some help, leaving his girlfriend to wait.

It was about this girl who was so close to her dog that every night it would sleep under her bed, and whenever she was scared or lonely she would put her hand under the bed and the dog would lick it. One night she kept on hearing a dripping sound. She found it a bit unsettling, so she put her hand under the bed and felt reassured by the hand-licking. The dripping kept on going, so she finally got up to see what it was. She walked into the bathroom and looked in horror.

On their first anniversary he asked again and she said \"no\" again. The same thing happened year after year and she always said no.

When she got home with the doll, she left it downstairs and went upstairs to do her homework. A little while later, the doll began walking up the stairs saying \u2018one step Rebecca\u2019, \u2018two steps Rebecca\u2019 and so on in a sing-song voice, all the way up to 10 stairs.

He couldn\u2019t stop thinking of that one door all night and wondered why it hadn\u2019t been changed. The next morning, curiosity got the best of him and he peeked in the keyhole on his way out. He saw a lady with long white hair standing in the corner, facing away from him. He shrugged and went about his day. He returned to the hotel later that night, exhausted and eager to get back to his room, but he saw the door again. He figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to look and when he did, it had been blocked. Something bright red seemed to have been put in front of the keyhole. \u2018They must have noticed me looking in earlier,\u2019 he thought, embarrassed. He went on his way to bed. The next morning he asked the hotel employee checking him out about the room. The lady said, \u2018Oh, last time someone stayed in that room, it was a bride waiting for her wedding to start.

I asked why and she said there was a cult that drove around at night looking for lights to go on and off in a house, and those were the houses they chose.

His strategy: \"When you are expecting me to do the traditional thing, I will just choose to do something that is uncharacteristic.\" Ofeibea Quist-Arcton/NPR Nigeria is the English-speaking world's Scrabble superpower. Africa's most populous nation is home not only to the global Scrabble champion, but team Nigeria ranks as the world's top Scrabble playing nation \u2014 ahead of the U.S. in second place. The Scrabble world champion is The Scrabble world champion is Wellington Jighere . He's 33, has a soft voice, a slow smile and a penchant for fedoras, earning him the nickname \"the Cat in the Hat.\" Jighere acknowledges that he's taciturn by nature, but also has an explosive, infectious laugh, though he considers Scrabble is serious business. \"You can't afford to waste too much energy doing unnecessary chatter,\" he says. \"During a tournament, I see it as business time. And that is no time to be joking around.\" Jighere plays chess to relax, \"and for fun,\" he says. Jet-lagged and weary, Jighere was crowned the world Scrabble champ last year in a grueling 32-round competition in Australia. Up to 30 of the top 100 global players are from Nigeria, which has the highest percentage of any country in the top 200. The Nigerians' apparent collective strategy \u2014 short words that rack up the points. Nigerians have been credited with perfecting that tactic under the tutorship of senior team coach, Prince Anthony Ikolo. He says Nigerians are passionate about Scrabble and the short word method gives them an edge. Many put Nigeria's towering Scrabble prowess down to its players ability to \"choke the board\" as they say, with this defensive play. \" The game of Scrabble is actually built around short words \u2014 especially five letter words,\" says Ikolo. \"If you have such a word base, then you are good to go. But it would be a very big mistake for the world to think our players only know short words, especially five-letter words,\" he warns. The coach says \"the short words help you to be defensive [by blocking longer words from opponents], but when it's time to be offensive, we know those long words also. Nigeria is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to Scrabble,\" says Ikolo. Ikolo, who's also a university mathematician, came up with lists of five-letter words and distributed them to his players, including Jighere the world champion, to train them how to block the board. The coach says, armed with these, the Nigerians could take on and beat competitors playing seven-eight- or even nine-letter words. The other strategy was to gather his players at a hotel, before the tournament, and have them play two days of nonstop Scrabble. It appears to have worked. Jighere though says his personal strategy is to have \"no strategy at all. I play a fluid kind of game. Yah. I really don't have a particular kind of style that you can pin me to, \"he says. So, when you are expecting me to do the traditional thing, I will just choose to do something that is uncharacteristic. It's what sets me apart from everyone else.\" Jighere should know. He and team Nigeria triumphed at the Jighere should know. He and team Nigeria triumphed at the World English-Language Scrabble Players Association world championship in Australia in November 2015. They fully intend to hang onto that success when they defend those titles next year in Kenya, he says. Nigeria's president, Muhammadu Buhari, phoned Australia to congratulate him, says Jighere with a big smile. \"It felt so warm to have him speak with me right then and there. It was a very, very important experience. He told me how proud he is of my accomplishment and how proud I have made the nation as a whole, not just the nation but Africa as a whole. And that it has really gone to prove that we are truly the giants of Africa.\" Jighere bested a Briton in Perth, while Team Nigeria dethroned the U.S., which had been at the pinnacle for about decade, with Nigeria yapping at its heels, determined to topple the Americans. \"We are currently ranked No. 1 nation in the world for Scrabble,\" says the champ. \"In the world we have the highest number of persons in the top 100 rated Scrabble players. We have as many as 20 to 30 tough masters in Nigeria that can really give you a tough fight any time any day.\" Ikolo, the coach, will attest to that. Jighere's friends and fellow Scrabble masters cut him no slack, in the jovial, noisy and garrulous atmosphere during the Lagos tournament. Ikolo gleefully told NPR that, until the Nigeria National Scrabble Players competition, in the main city Lagos, at the tail end of July, Jighere had failed to win any significant tournament after his success in Australia last year. \"Since he became the world champion, he has been beaten blue and black by his colleagues. It tells you how strong Nigeria's Scrabble is. It tells you that the Scrabble scene we have here is a very tough one. It's highly competitive and nobody can boast tomorrow that I'm going to win this, I'm going to win that when it comes to Nigerian Scrabble playing.\" So why Scrabble? \"Ah, I didn't exactly choose Scrabble,\" says Jightere. \"I ran into some friends who were tournament players and I beat them. They told me 'Ah, if I could do this well against them, that means I should come to the next tournament.' \" He adds, \"And I was like, \"Ah, you mean they play this in tournaments? OK, let's go. And the rest, as they say, is history.\" And he laughs. That was in 2002. Today, Jighere sits atop the global Scrabble tournament ladder. He describes how he had to overcome fatigue and jet lag to win in Australia. Learn those words, commit them to memory and stay cool \u2013 and awake. Scrabble was given official recognition as a sport in Nigeria in the 1990s. But local players, coaches, parents, officials and tournament organizers say government assistance has been patchy and more must be done to support, sponsor and finance Scrabble. \"Why will the government and corporate firms not look the way of Scrabble?\" laments coach Okolo. \"Government and corporate firms should come to the aid of Scrabble.\" The Lagos State government provided the venue \u2014 Teslim Balogun stadium for indoor sports \u2014 for the recent tournament, as well as organizing some logistics. But senior team coach Ikolo says while cash prizes are welcome, the authorities \u2014 and corporate sponsors \u2014 should do more to capitalize on Nigeria's global success at Scrabble. \"We don't value that Nigeria is ranked the best Scrabble playing nation in the world,\" says Ikolo, \"and we have the world Scrabble champion, Wellington Jighere.\" Enlarge this image Angela \"I'm not very shy!\" Osaigbovo, 10, of Nigeria came in second in a recent youth tournament, and triumphed at Scrabble camp in August.

Otherwise known as Rosa maris or \"sea rose\" according to the Greeks and romans, this medical herb has been used as a remedy for centuries back. In our culture, this herb is known as rosemary. th century. The rosemary is great for regulating the high blood pressure and for repairing digestive problems. This remedy is also used for numerous other diseases, such as heart problems, and was especially used in wines by Hungarian Queen Isabella in the 14century. The Queen was 72 years old and was dealing with gout. When she started using the rosemary as a medicine, she discovered immediate results and her skin became so much younger that even the Prince of Poland considered marrying her. According to research the magnificent rosemary is an amazing antioxidant, full of flavonoids which improve the circulation, regulate the thyroid\u2019s work and alleviates headaches. The rosemary has been particularly useful in cosmetics for encouraging hair growth. If you are suffering from stomach issues or crams, the rosemary will fix them immediately. Studies confirm that this herb positively affects the weight loss process as well, by burning fat effectively. One study, published in 1995 discovered that rosemary can destroy body toxins and act as a genuine diuretic. Furthermore, rosemary is able to prevent all sorts of inflammation, from bronchitis to ear, nose and throat infections. If you use rosemary externally and combine it with oil, it will relieve symptoms of sciatica, rheumatic pain and muscle soreness. Since it stimulates the circulation so well, the rosemary accentuates the hair growth and prevents dandruff and hair loss. The rosemary is not for oral use nor should it be given to children. Also, pregnant women are advised to consult their doctor before using it. Usually, small amounts in meals and while cooking are allowed. You can always prepare tea from the rosemary leaves and flowers which will calm the organism and help it relax. Moreover, rosemary can annihilate symptoms of depression and reduce menstrual cramps significantly. To use the rosemary to its best, here are two recipes that will help you: Take a teaspoon of fresh or dried rosemary and cover it with one cup of boiling water. Leave liquid to steep for 15 minutes and then strain with gauze. Take two cups per day, in the mornings and in the afternoon. Night dosage is not recommended since it can disturb the sleep. Rosemary tincture: Mix 1\u20442 cup medicinal alcohol with 1 tablespoon of rosemary leaves. Allow mixture to soak for 10 days, and then strain with gauze. Take 15 to 20 drops mixed in a glass of water every day. You can also use it externally to treat rheumatism and hair loss.

However, the anonymity provided by creeping through profiles (particularly public ones of people who aren\u2019t your Facebook \"friends\") is gone when you enter Stories mode. As you can see from the above screen grab, courtesy of CNet, there\u2019s a clear list of the people who view your story. So if you\u2019re creeping on a particular story, the person who posted will definitely know. Another potential drawback of Facebook\u2019s new enhancement is that Facebook isn\u2019t currently tracking screenshots of stories. So if you\u2019re having thoughts of some Yo Gotti-inspired action in your DMs, be aware that someone could be potentially taking pictures of your videos before they self-delete. The days of Facebook being exclusive to college students have been over for nearly a decade. If you want to test drive the new modification, be aware that your boss and or grandparents probably follow you on Facebook. ", "The Doomsday Clock, a metaphor for global catastrophe, remains set at three minutes to midnight. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Science and Security Board, in conjunction with the Board of Sponsors, which includes 16 Nobel Laureates, announced their annual decision on the clock's setting Tuesday afternoon, and said it would stay the same as last year. They said they based their decision on the global threat of climate change, as well as continued nuclear tensions between the U.S. and Russia and between Pakistan and India, and the recent claim by North Korea of testing a hydrogen bomb. Lawrence Krauss, chair of the Board of Sponsors and a renowned physicist and professor at Arizona State University, said that the decision to not move the clock is a sign of the troubles facing humanity. \"It is of grave concern that the situation remains largely the same,\" he told reporters. Despite the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by nearly 200 nations that agreed to reduce carbon emissions, Krauss said that \"the fight against climate change has barely begun.\" In order to improve the situation so the clock can be moved back, the Bulletin calls on the citizens of the world to implore leaders to reduce nuclear modernization programs, engage North Korea to reduce nuclear risks, follow up on the Paris accord deal and deal with commercial nuclear waste problems now. Each year, the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists analyzes global threats including nuclear weapons, climate-changing technologies, emerging biotechnologies and cybertechnology to determine how close the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock should be to midnight. Midnight, in this case, represents the apocalypse. Last year the Board agreed to move the clock to 11:57 -- two minutes closer to midnight than it was before -- because of a failure to halt climate change and an increasing nuclear arms arsenal. Kennette Benedict, executive director of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, told reporters that world leaders' failure to act on these issues endangers every person in the world. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded in 1945 by University of Chicago scientists who had helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The metaphoric Doomsday Clock was created two years later. The clock has moved 22 times in 69 years. The closest it has come to midnight was in 1953, when it was set at two minutes to midnight after the United States and Russia tested hydrogen bombs.", "How to Prevent Asthma Attacks the Natural Way I had asthma when I was a kid. I thought I was totally cured by it until it hit me again just recently. Asthma is a ubiquitous and costly disease and even despite repeated claims in the medical community that an asthma cure is impossible, that shouldn\u2019t stop you from looking after yourself. You don\u2019t have to be an expert on the subject, either, but you should at least understand as much as you can. I don\u2019t want to rely on drugs/chemical medication, so I look for more natural ways in battling or preventing asthma attack, and I\u2019m so honored to be part of this amazing platform where I can share bits of pieces to those going through the same path. First: get the right nutrients for your body. That starts with good diet, an integral part of an overall asthma treatment plan. When I say good diet, I mean a sustainable healthy diet. Good Food Community is all about that.

Identifying the culprits can be very hard, and the most bewildering part of it all is hidden or masked food allergy. Desserts have been a great part of family gatherings and parties, and eggs and dairy are among the most common food triggers of asthma attacks. This is very sad. Fortunately, I discovered Delicielo, which provides home-made, handmade artisanal breads and vegan desserts. \"What makes our desserts healthy are the high quality ingredients we use for every product that we have.

Sudden, sharp movements, especially when associated with cold, can bring on an asthma attack in seconds or most commonly known as Exercise Induced-Asthma or (Exercise Induced- Bronchoconstriction). However, steady, regular exercise, which promotes full lung expansion, will control it and adapt physical activities to your individual level of fitness. In the summer, it can almost get worse or flare off or just susceptible. Even then, though, the disease does not have to keep you from doing sports or enjoy the beauty of a sunset. You just have to know and respect your own limits. There\u2019s no need to limit yourself (and your pooch) to walks around the block or runs in the park. Dogs crave adventure, and many breeds are perfect for hiking, biking, or even swimming buddies. From my standpoint/perspective: First of all, It\u2019s vital to learn to identify your asthma triggers and take steps to avoid them. Being personally accountable is the key. Second of all, food isn\u2019t just fuel, contrary to popular belief and sadly, most doctors and asthma clinics underestimate the role that food plays in causing asthma. Every bite of food you eat sends some sort of message to your body. And your body responds accordingly. As far as I can tell, you don\u2019t have to live your life in fear and wondering, always waiting for the subsequent attack. May this article be a source of guidance to make yourself feel more calm and at ease. Knowing how to deal with your asthma better is in itself comforting.

Finally, an emergency room physician in Indianapolis had an idea. \"The first question he asked was if I was taking hot showers to find relief. When he asked me that question, I basically fell into tears because I knew he had an answer,\" Crowder said. The answer was cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS. It\u2019s caused by heavy, long-term use of various forms of marijuana. For unclear reasons, the nausea and vomiting are relieved by hot showers or baths. \"They\u2019ll often present to the emergency department three, four, five different times before we can sort this out,\" said Dr. Kennon Heard, an emergency room physician at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. He co-authored a study showing that since 2009, when medical marijuana became widely available, emergency room visits diagnoses for CHS in two Colorado hospitals nearly doubled. In 2012, the state legalized recreational marijuana. \"It is certainly something that, before legalization, we almost never saw,\" Heard said. \"Now we are seeing it quite frequently.\" Outside of Colorado, when patients do end up in an emergency room, the diagnosis is often missed. Partly because doctors don\u2019t know about CHS, and partly because patients don\u2019t want to admit to using a substance that\u2019s illegal. California overwhelmingly passed a measure to legalize marijuana for recreational use Tuesday. Similar measures passed in three other states, but... CHS can lead to dehydration and kidney failure, but usually resolves within days of stopping drug use. That\u2019s what happened with Crowder, who has been off all forms of marijuana for seven months. \"Now all kinds of ambition has come back. I desire so much more in life and, at 37 years old, it\u2019s a little late to do it, but better now than never,\"he said. CHS has only been recognized for about the past decade, and nobody knows exactly how many people suffer from it. But as more states move towards the legalization of marijuana, emergency room physicians like Dr. Heard are eager to make sure both doctors and patients have CHS on their radar.", "Can Curry win more titles than Jordan?

An audit in mid-April concluded the program improved productivity and worker health, and reduced absenteeism, The New York Times recently reported As one employee told the publication, \"a happy worker is a better worker,\" and the report added to a chorus of social scientists calling for fewer hours to boost work output. Can that formula be replicated across the Atlantic? Corporate coach Annie Perrin agrees that when companies make an effort to make their workers happy, it pays off. \"What the evidence suggests overwhelmingly is that the more organizations invest in their people, the more the people are going to invest back into the organization,\" she said in a recent interview with CNBC's \" \"What the evidence suggests overwhelmingly is that the more organizations invest in their people, the more the people are going to invest back into the organization,\" she said in a recent interview with CNBC's \" Power Lunch .\" The concept of a shorter workday could succeed, she said, as long as employees are intensely focused and working for those 30 hours. \"We don't think about measuring work that much in terms of hours. That's only one-half of the equation. The other half is the energy that you bring to those six hours of work,\" said Perrin, who has worked with companies like Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) as executive vice president at the Energy Project.

ROME \u2014 At what was meant to be a love fest for 900 nuns at a meeting of the International Union of Superiors General at the Vatican on Thursday, Pope Francis didn\u2019t just rock the boat; he may have created a tidal wave. During the question and answer session of the meeting, one of the sisters at the conference brought up the fact that women had served as deacons in the early church. Then, according to the National Catholic Reporter, she asked the pope, \"Why not construct an official commission that might study the question?\" Francis then said that he had discussed the matter of those early deaconesses with a professor several years earlier, but that he remained unclear about what role they actually served. \"What were these female deacons?\" Francis said he asked the professor, according to the National Catholic Reporter. \"Did they have ordination or no? It was a bit obscure. What was the role of the deaconess in that time?\" Then, apparently thinking out loud, he endorsed the idea. \"Constituting an official commission that might study the question?\" Francis asked. \"I believe yes. It would do good for the church to clarify this point. I am in agreement. I will speak to do something like this.\" The pope went on to address other concerns from the group of sisters, and dole out advice like \"take a deep breath\" and \"get more sleep\" and then revisited the topic. \"I accept,\" the pope said. \"It seems useful to me to have a commission that would clarify this well.\" Deacons in the Catholic context act as a sort of priest-lite: they cannot perform the sacrament of the Eucharist (give holy communion) and they don\u2019t have to take the vow of celibacy; in fact many are married. But they can perform any number of ministerial roles, from baptisms to funerals, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops website, which is something many of the world\u2019s Catholics just might appreciate. Quoting canon 1024 of the Code of Canon Law, Catholic website Crux points out that at the moment, \"only a baptized male can receive the sacrament of ordination, so the law does not presently permit female deacons.\" Crux editors then question whether Francis will change the law, which is within his powers as pope. As exciting as this is for roughly one half of the world\u2019s Catholic population (the female half), surely not everyone will be pleased at the idea of women nudging one step closer to the all-male clergy club that rules the Catholic Church. Almost immediately, liberal priests tweeted their praise. Father James Martin, a prolific author priest from New York, tweeted that the news filled him with \"immense joy\" and that, \"Women deacons would be able to baptize, preside at marriages and funerals, and preach at Mass. It would be an immense gift to the church.\" A more conservative priest tweeted, \"Has @Pontifex forgotten about this 2002 study about diaconate where issue of women deacons was examined?\" referring to a Vatican study that all but nixed the idea.", "Meet Yulia Viktorovna Vins from Russia is a body builder.

According to the law, HB2 or the \"bathroom bill,\" when you\u2019re in public building\u2014a government agency, a public school, whatever\u2014the gender listed on your birth certificate is the only one that matters. You remember the initial hubbub: North Carolina and the federal government suing each other, the boycotts and the hashtags and the Bruce Springsteen concerts cancelled. In spite of that, North Carolina\u2019s government hasn\u2019t repealed the law, and this week, the state lost high-profile sporting events, too, as the ACC and the NCAA pulled their championship games out of the state in protest. (If the NCAA is looking at you sideways, you know you\u2019re doing something shady.) But we\u2019re not here to talk about how the bill is bad and discriminatory. The DOJ made that call months ago. So did popular opinion, both nationwide and in North Carolina itself. Especially now that the NCAA and ACC joined in the boycott the loss of business represents a significant economic penalty for North Carolina. And it\u2019s North Carolinians, most of whom don\u2019t even support the legislation, who get stuck with the bill. So we decided to figure out how big a bill it is. Adding It All Up One thing to note: You\u2019re never going to get an exact, cent-perfect total\u2014mainly because we\u2019re talking opportunity cost here. But here\u2019s what we do know. First, people are suing the crap out of these guys. North Carolina\u2019s Republican leadership racked up at least $176,000 in legal fees so far, $47,000 of which is just lawyers for the beleaguered Governor Pat McCrory. Why do those numbers matter? They are paid with tax dollars, and they\u2019re rising. In June, the North Carolina legislature approved diverting $500,000 from the disaster relief fund to Governor McCrory\u2019s offices for HB2 litigation. Sure, this HB2 situation\u2019s a disaster. But in a state that sees two, three hurricanes per year ... they might have done other things with that money\u2014especially as hurricane season gets underway. So it costs taxpayers money to fight lawsuits. How much does it cost them that businesses now see North Carolina as a bad investment? According to the think tank Center for American Progress, business boycotts and pullouts have cost North Carolina another $87.7 million. Charlotte has recently been a popular filming location, so when Lionsgate puts the kibosh on filming in North Carolina after HB2, just that led to three million dollars down the drain. North Carolinians lost $58.3 million when PayPal and an \"unnamed tech company\" canceled their planned expansions to the state. North Carolina has been vying the past few years for attention as the Silicon Valley of the South, but the loss of those jobs\u2014and the anti-HB2 amicus brief signed by 68 companies, including notable tech giants like Apple, Dropbox, Salesforce, Slack, SV Angel, Yelp, and Zynga\u2014 have put a damper on that campaign. \"There\u2019s a clear drumbeat here, and a bit of a snowball effect,\" says Laura Durso, senior director of the LGBT Research and Communications Project at the Center for American Progress. \"More and more companies are taking a look at their own values, and living those out.\" But by far the sector of North Carolina\u2019s economy most strapped by HB2 backlash is tourism. Leaving aside sports for a second, by the figuring of Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority, the Greater Raleigh Convention and Visitors Bureau, and the Greensboro Convention and Visitors Bureau, the state\u2019s three largest cities lost $109.4 million to canceled conferences and other events since HB2. That\u2019s things like the Bruce Springsteen concert, which probably contributed about $700,000 to that loss alone. But now we get to where it really hurts North Carolina most: sports. And here we\u2019re talking the total economic impact as opposed to direct spending. That includes the ticket sales and hotel rooms, but also the cost to the florist down the street who would have done arrangements for a post-game reception. When the NBA pulled their All-Star Game, North Carolina missed out on $106 million. When the NCAA and ACC followed suit with their championship games, it means a loss of at least another $91.4, $51 million from the NCAA events and $40.4 million from the ACC\u2019s. While it might sound frivolous in comparison to losing, say, 400 highly skilled PayPal jobs with an estimated total salary of $20 million, college basketball abandoning North Carolina is hitting the state in its heart. \"It obviously a loss for our grand basketball tradition,\" says Chris Sgro, executive director of LGBTQ rights organization Equality North Carolina and a member of the state\u2019s General Assembly. \"In many of our cities, we\u2019ll have a sporting event drought for years to come if we don\u2019t repeal HB2.\" As one North Carolinian put it: \"college sports is religion in North Carolina.\" And for now it\u2019s gone. The Grand Total Adding all that up, the total cost to North Carolinians so far from HB2 protests is slightly more than $395 million. That\u2019s more than the GDP of Micronesia. And the bulk of it is from sporting organizations, who even five years ago would likely not have waded into political territory like this. But experts aren\u2019t that surprised that the NBA, NCAA, and ACC have taken this step now. \"They\u2019re not out on a limb here,\" Durso says. \"They\u2019re in line with their base.\" The near unanimous outcry against HB2 and in support of the NCAA and ACC confirms that. Legislating discrimination has become an expensive bad habit.", "During Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes, actress Meryl Streep was given the Cecil B.

Entrepreneur, author and public speaker Tim Ferriss recently discovered just how crucial our food is when writing his new book, Tools of Titans.  In his research, he spoke to some of the most successful people in the world - be they top performers or entrepreneurs - about their tactics, routines and habits, including their diets. Ferriss found that a lot of the world\u2019s biggest achievers credit their eating habits with their success. So just what do they do? It might sound boring, but eating the same thing for breakfast every day might be a good place to start. When you\u2019re busy, deciding what to eat when you wake up in the morning is just one more thing to think about. Best-selling author and blogger Seth Godin, for example, revealed to Ferriss that he has the same smoothie, consisting of frozen bananas, hemp powder, almond milk, prunes, and walnuts, every morning, according to Thrillist. Alongside your smoothie, if you want to be really successful, try drinking titanium tea. The tea is Ferriss\u2019 own blend made from Pu'er (an aged black tea), dragonwell green tea, coconut oil, MCT oil, turmeric and ginger. Despite its foul smell, Ferriss drinks the tea - which he calls \"rocket fuel for the brain\" - every morning and believes it\u2019s one of the best ways to energise yourself for the day and encourage fat-loss. Perhaps unsurprisingly, coffee is not a recommended source of energy - Ferriss found his productivity levels soared when he gave up caffeine.  He believes it\u2019s fine in moderation but if you drink too much, it \"can contribute to long-term chronic fatigue\" which will inhibit productivity. In his book, Ferriss also recommends adding goat whey protein to your diet to boost your immune system.  Whilst it doesn\u2019t exactly sound appetising, it was recommended to him by Charles Poliquin, \"a famed strength coach, who's worked with Olympic medalists in 20+ sports,\" Thrillist reports. The reason goat whey is preferable to other whey proteins is that a lot of people struggle to digest lactose: \"You can dodge that in large part by trying a goat whey protein instead of a normal dairy whey protein,\" he says. And perhaps one of the most important ways to improve your chances of success is in fact not to add anything to your diet but to eat nothing at all - Ferriss recommends fasting for three days every few months. He spoke to Dr. Dominic D'Agostino, associate professor at the University of South Florida\u2019s college of medicine, who recommends doing a \u2018purge fast\u2019 one to three times per year to \"purge any precancerous cells that may be living in your body.\" Because when you\u2019re healthier, you\u2019re more able to focus and thus more likely to achieve your goals.", "We went to Area 51 to Play Pokemon Go and You Won\u2019t Believe What We Found With the launch of Pokemon Go, the world was curious to know if any Pokemon were to be found at the infamous Extraterrestrial Highway Area 51, and if so, would there be any Pokestops or Gyms? Area 51 is one of the most secret and heavily guarded military bases on the planet and home to much alien folklore. The curiosity reached a boiling point, and people demanded answers. Will we find Free Pokemon Cheats and Coins? Situated in the southern portion of Nevada, the base has long been considered one of the most mysterious U.S. Armed Forces establishments, with rumors suggesting it\u2019s used to store alien lifeforms and build high-tech weaponry to fend off alien attacks. This all depends on the size of your tin foil hat, of course. The Extraterrestrial Highway is State Route 375 (SR 375) located in south-central Nevada in the United States. The area did indeed feature Pokemon team hunting grounds and also several gyms and Pokestops. We even found a Pokemon right at the back gate of the military base and several rare Pokemon features in the immediate surrounding area. We were shocked to find empty gyms. There were two completely empty gyms right outside the back gate of the base in the very small town of Rachel, NV. This town has been featured in movies such as Paul, Independence Day, and many others. At the time of this writing, Fraghero controls 8 pokemon gyms along the extraterrestrial highway leading up to Area 51 itself. We caught several types of Area 51 Pokemon Warning: Don\u2019t try to do this, we were extremely careful and didn\u2019t break any rules, not to mention our reporter is an ex-military veteran. We won\u2019t be responsible if you end up being detained or worse. Here\u2019s what we found along the Extraterrestrial Highway, and all the way to the Back Gate of Area 51: At the corner before you turn on to the highway there is an Alien Jerky Shop with multiple Pokestops The sign marking the start of the highway. There is also a gym and a Pokestop located here! We found this guy at this abandoned gas station: Just chilling in the middle of nowhere: You will see all kinds of weird stuff on the highway, and almost each one has a Pokestop: Once you get close to the main gate of the base, they block all mobile signal, but there was a bit of signal at the back gate, which we\u2019ll cover below. The road to the main gate of Area 51: We out here Located right by the Main gate road: After the main base gate road, if you drive a few more miles down the road you get to the town of Rachel, NV. This town is home to the world famous Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, which has been featured in many movies (Paul, Independence Day, etc.) Located there were 3 gyms, and 5 Pokestops. To our shock and surprise, the gyms were completely empty. Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn you stole our hearts. We stole your gyms. More empty gyms! Located around the town are several Pokestops and Pokemon: Located right by the town of Rachel is back gate road. This road leads to the back gate of Area 51. We were able to have mobile signal for the entire drive all the way up to the actual gate. Here\u2019s a photo of the south gate: (We would post our own, but it\u2019s illegal to photograph this area): Here\u2019s a screenshot of our Pokemon Go app at the Back Gate of Area 51: (There\u2019s Pokemon!) And again at night: On the drive home, we found a Pikachu nearby, at almost every power plant/station (Pikachus store energy in their red cheeks): We also found Charmanders at large truck stops/gas stations in the \"Diesel\" section. Area 51 definitely has a lot to offer for Pokemon Go Tricks players, but it would be stupid to venture out there without doing some extensive research prior to making a trip. However, someone needed to go there and get answers for the millions of Pokemon players out there with this Pokemon Guide, and Fraghero was happy to volunteer for the arduous task.", "W hen Lauren Hernandez was 1 year old, she met Joe Iosco. She may not remember it, but this day was a defining moment in her life. As she grew older, Iosco, her mother\u2019s long-term boyfriend, was always there for her. He acted like the best father that anyone could ever ask for. He supported her, loved her, and treated her exactly as he treats his own biological daughters. Maybe that was because he didn\u2019t feel like he was acting like a father. He really did consider Lauren to be his very own child. At 18 years old, Hernandez graduated high school. At her graduation party, she knew exactly what gift she wanted. Iosco had no idea what was coming. When Hernandez handed him a gift, he was a bit thrown off. He thought this was supposed to be her party! Inside, he found a beautiful poem. He thought that was it, and he was already getting emotional. Then, he sees that there is another envelope hidden at the very bottom of the gift box... official adoption papers. This is the greatest gift that either of them could ever have asked for on this day.", "You might want to think twice before purchasing conventionally grown strawberries, spinach, or nectarines. According to a new report from the Environmental Working Group (EWG), these foods are the most likely to be contaminated with synthetic pesticide residue. The findings are part of the EWG\u2019s 2017 \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"Clean Fifteen,\" a list of the most and least pesticide-ridden foods. To compile the ranking, the EWG analyzed tests conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug of more than 36,000 samples from 48 different types of conventionally grown produce. \"Even low levels of pesticide exposure can be harmful to infants, babies and young children, so when possible, parents and caregivers should take steps to lower children\u2019s exposures to pesticides while still feeding them diets rich in healthy fruits and vegetables,\" said Dr. Philip Landrigan of the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, in a statement. For the second year in the row, the EWG found that strawberries were the most contaminated fruit. Just last year, the red berry knocked apples\u2014which held the title of most contaminated for five years\u2014from the top spot. Pesticide residue has increased in strawberries because of out-of-season demand. This year, the most contaminated strawberry had traces of 20 different pesticides. Also moving up on the list this year are spinach and nectarines. Spinach jumps from the eighth to the second most contaminated product. The USDA found spinach samples contained more residue by weight than all other produce tested, and 75 percent of samples contained residue of permethrin, an insecticide that is used to treat lice and repel mosquitos. In high doses, it can cause damage to the nervous system. So what conventionally grown produce is safe to purchase? Sweet corn, according to the EWG. Only 1 percent of samples of both sweet corn and avocados (last year\u2019s top pick) had any detectable pesticides. Though you\u2019re safe from pesticide residue because of the food\u2019s protective exterior, it\u2019s important to note that the EWG does warn that a small amount of sweet corn, as well as papaya and summer squash, are produced from genetically modified seeds. (Buy organic if you\u2019re trying to avoid altered produce.) The EWG lists, which started in 1993, have gained a reputation among many notable doctors and health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, for reducing pesticide exposure in diets. But the Dirty Dozen list has also attracted some criticism for focusing on quantity of pesticides rather than toxicity. According to Sonya Lunder, EWG senior analyst, the group has taken to highlighting crops, like hot peppers this year, as the \"Dirty Dozen Plus.\" These produce picks don\u2019t meet the traditional criteria, but have been found to have residue of highly toxic pesticides on them. Additionally, some critics have pointed out that the levels of pesticide residue found on the food in this list, though higher than other fruits and vegetables, are generally still well below EPA tolerance levels. However, the EWG stands behind their list and cautions consumers to pay attention to any substantial trace of synthetic pesticide. Lunder told RealSimple.com in an e-mail that in the past, the Environmental Protection Agency has \"revoked tolerances\" or changed legal limits or altogether banned certain insecticides thought to be safe after revising risk assessment. For example, last fall the tolerances for Chlorpyrifos, a pesticide once widely detected on fruits and vegetables, were revoked after it no longer met the EPA\u2019s safety standards. The Dirty Dozen: Strawberries, Spinach, Nectarines, Apples, Peaches, Pears, Cherries, Grapes, Celery, Tomatoes, Sweet bell peppers, Potatoes The Clean Fifteen: Sweet corn, Avocados, Pineapples, Cabbage, Onions, Sweet peas, frozen Papaya, Asparagus, Mangos, Eggplant, Honeydew, Melon, Kiwi, Cantaloupe, Cauliflower, Grapefruit", "It sounds like a dream: Checking your bank balance to find it higher, much higher, than it should be. But it can \u2014 and does \u2014 happen. American consumers have seen bank mistakes in their favor for thousands and even hundreds of thousands of dollars. \"I felt like I was in a Monopoly moment,\" Leslie Holland told NBC about opening a statement from her brokerage account to see $23,000 that wasn't hers. \"Like getting the card that says bank error in your favor: Collect $200.\" \"You do have that moment of 'Oh my God, I won the lottery,'\" said Holland, a marketing executive in Louisville, Kentucky. She didn't call her bank immediately. \"I was walking around in windfall shock. You think about 'Can I keep it?'\" Mike Lieberman had the same thought after the sale of his Brooklyn apartment in 2014. After he signed over his proceeds to a visibly tired teller, he noticed the deposit slip showed a mistake in his favor \u2014 to the tune of $700,000. \"It's weird,\" he told NBC News. \"Like in a movie when you see something happens to a person and a million things run through their mind in a split second. I looked at it [and thought] 'Holy cr*p, this is really not right. Can I keep it, can I spend it, can I invest it and give it back before anyone notices?' This all goes through your head really fast.\" Industry insiders insist that while mistakes do happen, they are very few compared to the billions of successful transactions carried out every day. \"We conduct billions of transactions on a daily basis that are correct on both sides,\" said Doug Johnson, senior vice president for payments and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association. But \"there's always the potential for human error.\" And when mistakes are made, \"'Don't keep it,' is the firm advice,\" Johnson said. \"Eventually, the bank will come back to the customer. First they'll reverse the transaction but also potentially generate a police report after effective research, meaning the bank will contact the customer ... and ask the logical questions: Did they notice that it was inadvertently deposited, why didn't they alert the bank, why didn't they return the funds. It creates a whole confluence of events that are not attractive.\" One Georgia teen learned this the hard way. After spending $30,000 in his bank account that didn't belong to him, the young man earned a 10-year sentence, according to local news reports. A teller had deposited a check from a client with the same last name into the teen's account; he spent most of the funds on a BMW. Lieberman, a former neuroscientist, speculated on how a person might make such a bad decision. The same part of the brain that gives us a rush when, say, we win a hand of cards, kicks in when we confront a scenario like unexpected money, Lieberman suggested. The limbic system is like the rewards circuitry. \"There's a lot of dopamine signaling ... your heart rate goes up, your pupils dilate, you start sweating. That's when you make bad decisions. A lot of this is evolutionary response.\" The pre-frontal cortex, which controls reasoning and judgment, is one of the last parts of the brain to fully develop. \"It takes training and learning and life experience\" to not let that quick rush override your judgment, said Lieberman. \"I'm fortunate that I didn't do something stupid.\" After his split-second deliberations, Lieberman pointed out the $700,000 mistake to the teller. Holland pointed out her bank's error, too. \"At the end of the day this isn't my money and I kept visualizing a little old lady who's missing $23,000. I'm glad my mother taught me right from wrong,\" she said. To avoid such situations, keep a close eye on your accounts. \"Manage your balance yourself in addition to what your bank is doing,\" Johnson said. Online banking may have made it easy to throw out the old fashioned check registers, but he uses his to reconcile his account to the penny, \"even though I only write a check to the woman who takes care of our cats every two months.\" Software is also available to double check the bank's figures. And at the teller line, look at the deposit slip as confirmation and verify it is the amount intended. Also, Johnson said, double check remote deposits made with phones. \"It's really important in this world to protect yourself and to take responsibility even though we largely depend on financial institutions to do that for us,\" Johnson said. Still not convinced? Consider this: \"Back to my cybersecurity paranoia, some measures assist customers in protecting from unauthorized transactions on the other side,\" he said. \"You can definitely play a major role in the first line of defense.\" Because even if you're not in a hurry to report that big deposit, we would all want to know right away if money's going out that shouldn't.", "It was a mom drink, the kind of thing people brought over for a potluck -- if they wanted to disappoint the children. She remembers her family taking in a German foreign exchange student, who couldn't get enough of the stuff. \"I hated it,\" says Schinderle, who grew up \"all over\" Wisconsin, and went to high school in Eau Claire. \"I was like, 'this tastes like nothing.

Schinderle was \"reintroduced\" to the local product during high school, in the late 1990s, when LaCroix started offering more flavors. It grew on her. And on America. Today, LaCroix is ubiquitous, the best-selling brand of sparkling water in the country. For many consumers, it's supplanted diet soft drinks as a guilt-free addiction; last year, a And on America. Today, LaCroix is ubiquitous, the best-selling brand of sparkling water in the country. For many consumers, it's supplanted diet soft drinks as a guilt-free addiction; last year, a Bloomberg business story lauded LaCroix for its fiercely loyal clientele. JoAnn Schinderle wouldn't want you to go around embarrassing yourself by pronouncing LaCroix wrong. From 2010 to 2014, while Pepsi and Coca Cola's shares of the water industry shrank, LaCroix's parent company saw its share grow by two-thirds. Schinderle's seeing the drink more and more along the West Coast. Based in Portland, Schinderle travels the region working as a stand-up comic. Now that Washington, Oregon, and California all allow recreational use of marijuana, some conscientious users are picking LaCroix instead of booze when they're getting stoned. It's also popular among people who are hungover, or recovering alcoholics. Schinderle herself is drinking a lot more of it during a recent calculated stretch of sobriety. \"I'm trying to lose weight and get on TV,\" she says. She always felt a twinge of Wisconsin pride when she saw the pastel-colored cans in the hands of stylish Portlandia hipsters and sunkissed beauties in L.A. Then she heard how they were pronouncing it. \"La-kwah,\" they said. As if Schinderle had fallen bumped her head and somehow woken up on the French Riviera. Taking it upon herself to gently correct them -- \"LaCroix,\" she says, leaving a hard 'r' in there -- Schinderle's been surprised to find people fighting back, as if they know better than her. One talked down to her, as though she was a \"brand ambassador\" for LaCroix. Schinderle pulls rank. I'm from Wisconsin, she says. The drink is named for the city of LaCrosse, its home, and for the St. Croix River, and anyone who pronounces that river \"kwah\" was French and is dead.

That's precisely why the drug could be an effective treatment for people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), early studies show. A large-scale clinical trial is set to move forward next year to test the therapeutic benefits of MDMA\u2014a.k.a. ecstasy, or molly\u2014in survivors of war combat, sexual assault, violent crimes and other traumatic experiences. SEE ALSO: New artificial intelligence technique could erase fear from your brain This week, the Food and Drug Administration said researchers could move ahead with the trial after a series of smaller trials proved successful. The bigger Phase 3 trial could pave the way for the agency to approve ecstasy as a legal drug within a few years. \"It changed my life,\" C.J. Hardin, a U.S. Army veteran who served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, told the New York Times.  \"It allowed me to see my trauma without fear or hesitation and finally process things and move forward,\" he said. Promising results push FDA to green light broad trials for Ecstasy as treatment for PTSD https://t.co/yS1mNo4eHY \u2014 David Philipps (@David_Philipps) November 29, 2016 Hardin participated in an earlier clinical trial in South Carolina that combined weeks of psychotherapy with limited doses of MDMA, administered under a psychiatrist's guidance. The Phase 3 trial could follow a similar approach, and include hundreds more patients. Like so many street drugs, ecstasy use comes with (and is also known for) a wide array of health risks, like high fevers, liver failure, cardiac arrest or brain damage. But the drug remains popular among recreational users for its \"prosocial\" effects\u2014the increased sensations of friendliness, affection and trust.  Studies of MDMA's effects on the brain show the drug triggers the release of a hormone called oxytocin, thought to bring about those prosocial feelings. Ecstasy may also tamp down feelings like fear or threat, by weakening activity in the brain's amygdala region. Two 2014 studies found that MDMA reduced subjects' abilities to perceive negative emotional states in other people. Not only that, but the drug also made participants less bothered by social rejection. Like MDMA, PTSD also significantly alters brain activity\u2014but in a completely different way.  Traumatic stress can cause increased activity in the fear-stoking amygdala region, studies show. It also interferes with neurochemical systems that moderate stress and affect memory functions. By combining MDMA with therapy, patients can quiet their disabling fears and explore the root of their trauma in a more productive way, said Brad Burge, communications director for the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a small nonprofit funding MDMA clinical trials. \"When people are processing extremely difficult or fearful emotions, as is the case with PTSD, it can be very helpful in allowing people to clearly describe what they're experiencing,\" he told Mashable by phone from Santa Cruz, California. Hardin, the U.S. veteran, said ecstasy helped him climb out of a world marked by sleepless nights and dreams of explosions and death. \"The MDMA sessions showed me a light I could move toward,\" he told the Times from his home in Charleston, South Carolina. Ann and Michael Mithoefer, a wife-and-husband team leading clinical trials in South Carolina, said they found a combination of non-drug therapy sessions and drug-assisted sessions together reduced a range of negative symptoms in their patients. In one trial, the patients reported a 56 percent drop in the severity of symptoms like general anxiety, depression and nightmares. At the end of the study, two-thirds of patients no longer met the criteria for having PTSD, according to the Mithoefers' research published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology.  Follow-up exams with patients found the improvements lasted over more than a year after therapy. The trail was one of six Phase 2 studies backed by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. Burge said that among the 106 total participants, 66 percent no longer had PTSD by the end of the trial. The association as of now is the only U.S. organization driving clinical research in MDMA for therapeutic use in PTSD.  The drug first emerged from the labs of German drug manufacturer Merck in the 1910s. In the following decades, researchers\u2014included the U.S. Army in the 1950s\u2014explored the synthetic drug's potential uses in psychotherapy and psychiatry. But when ecstasy became a popular club drug in the 1980s and 90s, governments worldwide cracked down. U.S. regulators in 1985 placed the pill on a list of prohibited substances that included heroin and LSD. The association was created that same year. Burge said the organization needs to raise at least $20 million to support three to four years of Phase 3 trials. A chunk of that money will go toward paying a drug manufacturer to make pharmaceutical-grade MDMA for the research. He said he expects the FDA to formally green-light the Phase 3 trial in early 2017, and potentially approve the drug for prescription use by 2021. \"We see a very clear path ahead,\" Burge said. \"More people are realizing that we need better approaches to the treatment of PTSD. That's contributed to more [societal] openness toward this research.\" Medical experts who spoke with the Times said they were hopeful out the upcoming clinical trials but remained wary of the potential for drug abuse. After all, opioid painkillers like OxyContin are prescription drugs. And the U.S. is now suffering an epidemic of opioid addiction. \"It's a feel-good drug, and we know people are prone to abuse it,\" Dr. Charles R. Marmar, the head of psychiatry at New York University\u2019s Langone School of Medicine, told the newspaper. Marmar is a leading PTSD researcher and was not involved in the study. And of course, prolonged use of ecstasy might harm the brain, several studies have shown. A 2011 study found that long-term users risk damaging their brain structure and developing significant memory problems. Another study in 2013 found long-term ecstasy use may alter brain activation in regions that affect verbal memory. Still, Marmar said it \"will be of great use\" if the clinical studies show positive results. \"PTSD can be very hard to treat,\" he told the Times. \"Our best therapies right now don't help 30 to 40 percent of people. So we need more options.\"", "Michael Reynolds\u2013Pool/Getty Images Noam Scheiber at the New York Times posted a fantastic piece Monday about a surprising source of opposition to the Obama administration\u2019s new overtime regulations: media and political elites. Helaine Olen Helaine Olen is a columnist for Slate and co-author of The Index Card. She is the host of the Slate Academy series the United States of Debt. As of Dec. 1, the law will require employers to pay the vast majority of salaried employees earning less than $47,476 annually overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours a week, double the current standard. As Vice President Joe Biden said when he announced the new regulations earlier this month, \"If you work overtime, you should actually get paid for working overtime.\" The administration estimates this will raise the pay of more than 4 million workers by $12 billion over the next decade. And if an employer doesn\u2019t want to pay the bill? Well, employees gain free time. Sounds great, right? Not, apparently, if you are a New York publishing insider. \"You want to bump into the boss at 8 o\u2019clock at night,\" Dan Reynolds, the chief executive of Workman Publishing and a man otherwise known as, uh, the boss, told Scheiber. Or a political activist. In a statement released shortly after the rules were announced, Andre Delattre, the executive director of the United States Public Interest Research Group, better known as US PIRG, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization, whined, \"A person of means\u2014in service of a cause to which they feel deeply committed\u2014can volunteer to work for our organization for free for as many hours as they wish, but a person of lesser means\u2014who is no less committed to the work we do\u2014cannot agree to work for our organization for less than $47,476 without having their work hours strictly limited in order to keep our costs affordable.\" What\u2019s going on here? When the Obama administration first announced their intention to reform the overtime regulations two years ago, some of the most vehement protest came from employers of low-wage workers, like the fast food industry. And little wonder. While hourly workers are almost always eligible for overtime pay, salaried workers are not\u2014unless, that is, they earn less than the overtime threshold. When that amount was set at the current $23,660, there was an easy enough dodge. Give someone a managerial or professional title, and you were all but home free. While some companies\u2014Hi, Chipotle!\u2014have been sued by current and former employees who allege that their highfalutin\u2019 job descriptions did not match the reality of their less than impressive responsibilities, it seems all but certain the vast majority got away with the practice. The new rules are, of course, an attempt to do away with this rather disgraceful behavior. But raising the issue brought another uncomfortable truth to light. Employers in lower-prestige professions like fast food are not the only ones treating employees unfairly. Any number of higher-end, more prestigious industries were relying on the business model, too. Scheiber calls it \"The Devil Wears Prada economy,\" after the famed Lauren Weisberger novel, widely thought to be about her time working for Vogue\u2019s Anna Wintour. This is, of course, something of an established path for career advancement. You work long hours at your intro job\u2014like, say, editorial assistant, or political canvasser, or would-be Hollywood agent\u2014and try to take on extra duties as well, in the hopes the boss will notice you and promote you up. This model has its supporters, including Slate\u2019s Jordan Weissman, who wrote last year, \"while overtime functions pretty well when it's used to discourage companies from working vulnerable employees in low-skill positions to the bone, it's not necessarily appropriate in creative industries where educated young people are out to make a name for themselves and margins are thin.\" However, an argument could be made that by enabling this sort of behavior at the more prestigious ends of the labor market, we are making the practice more acceptable for everyone by normalizing it. Americans, somewhat famously, are a nation of workaholics. In 2014, a Gallup survey found that the average American claimed to be putting in 47 hours a week on the job. As I pointed out last year, most of us seem to think that\u2019s proper, or at least acceptable. We idealize Silicon Valley, where outsize workweeks are the norm. Yet this sort of time on the job is not exactly effective. Academic studies show that work performance deteriorates rapidly after someone puts in more than 50 hours a week. In fact, the drop-off point might even come after significantly fewer hours on the job. An Australian survey recently found that for people over the age of 40, performance began to decline after a mere 25 hours a week. Moreover, it\u2019s easy to suspect that the bosses claiming that their underlings are desperate to work long hours for low pay are telling themselves what they want to hear. A quick tour of Glass Door, a site for job listings and career advice, makes it clear that many of US PIRG\u2019s employees and former employees have a different take. \"Take better care of your employees. Invest in them. Give them the financial resources to have a live outside of work,\" one wrote the week after the new regulations were announced. \"With such a low pay and laborious workload, it\u2019s hard for people to make it a long-term job,\" a former canvasser claimed. \"Very long hours, high turnover, terrible work/life balance - employees are expected to devote almost all their time to their jobs (80+ hours a week),\" wrote a third. Liberals like to point fingers when people like presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims, \"Wages are too high,\" because, as he put it a Republican debate last November, \"People have to go out, they have to work really hard and they have to get into that upper stratum.\" But as the US PIRG example reveals, it turned out they\u2014OK, we\u2014have something of a problem of our own.", "You'd think it'd be impossible to have a late loved one seemingly come back from the dead.

The ex-speaker of the House from the 1990\u2019s, Newt Gingrich, who has reappeared on the political scene in 2012 to oppose Mitt Romney for a Republican presidential candidature- claims that Trump is the right nominee to do so.

That, he said, could have \"Democrats on defensive virtually everywhere in the country. Particularly if Trump decides to go big.\" Is there anyone watching the 2016 contest so far \u2013 Trump supporter or opponent \u2013 who doubts that the man will go big? Answering questions from Facebook viewers, Gingrich expounded on the theme. The unexpectedly strong challenge Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has mounted to Hillary Clinton\u2019s nomination for the Democrats only underscores the former secretary of state\u2019s vulnerability in a general election, he said. If Clinton does eventually secure the nomination \u2014 which appears to be a sure bet at this point \u2014 the young people who turned out for Sanders in state after state could well find their way into the Trump camp come Election Day, Gingrich said. Trump has said the same thing as Trump has said the same thing as TPNN reported Clinton\u2019s ongoing email scandal, her deep and embarrassing (for a Democrat) ties to the financial world, and the continuing cloud that hangs over the global money laundering operation known as the Clinton Foundation will make it impossible for her to count on former Sanders\u2019 supporters, Gingrich pointed out. \"There will be a lot of Democrats out there looking for someone to go to,\" he predicted.\u2019 By \u2018someone\u2019 it could be meant the ex-reality-television star and billionaire businessman, Donald Trump. So, that means that the Republicans who challenged Donald Trump in the first season must get on board for the general elections, stated Gingrich. \"I tell all the folks who have the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 sign, they need to replace it with a \u2018Never Hillary\u2019 sign,\" stated the former House speaker.", "As we all know, in one of the scenes in the recently released Sultan, is seen sporting a pot belly look.

Deborah Smith was refused entry from the club, and went home to complain on The Loft's page. She wrote: It is 3.30am and I have been refused entry to the LOFT in Weston Super Mare!!!! Why???? Because some foreign t**t says I was too p**sed to enter. Too p**sed? Assumed buy (sic) a god dam foreigner? In my country? England!!!!! Born in Somerset... and told I am too wankered by some olive coloured T***! Her rant continued on the club's Facebook page: She also promised to share her views on \"every social god dam(sp) media site I can find\". But the club\u2019s response (which was taken down by Facebook for some reason) ended up making the drunk rant a viral hit. The Loft's response read: Thank you ******* *****, for your racist spiel this morning in our inbox and all over our Facebook wall. It certainly made us grimace that even in today's society there are such dim lights still flickering in the background harboring such racist and personally disgusting views towards other human beings.  We have a society of acceptance and tolerance within the UK, yet there are people who still exist with such out dated and outrageous beliefs of racial hatred. As for your refusal at The Loft, did you not for one second think that the door staff could have been British citizens with a proud heritage? As for \"Olive coloured f***ing a****le\" (sic) What color would you prefer the doormen to be in your country? Is there a particular shade of white that is acceptable? Maybe you feel it should be part of the interview process, to hold candidates against a color chart and deviations shall not be permitted past a shade either side.  Maybe you would like us to have a pure white British, non-Muslim member of staff, on call for your benefit so you can accept the rules when you are told them. Again color and heritage seem to be so important to yourself when understanding \"Sorry you can't come in you have had too much to drink.\" The rules the door staff are following are those set by an institution you may have heard of known as the BRITISH government and it's a pesky legislation called the licensing act. Last time I checked it was situated in England the country you appear to have claimed ownership of. Fancy those \" god d** foreigners\"(sic) as you like to call them upholding English rules. Fancy someone telling you in your country, your own rules from your own government. How dare they ? To save any further mix-ups on the door, we feel we should assist you with your understanding and communication with regards to your rights of entry at The Loft in the future. They are revoked, removed, and categorically rescinded. The reason for this is: We feel that you wouldn\u2019t like it in here. We let people in of every skin color, in fact we even let non-English white ones like Canadians in, fancy that someone being white but not British? We allow people who follow all faiths even Muslims, Christians, Roman Catholics, Pastafarians, Sikhs, Jedi and Buddhists. We welcome members of the LGBT community as well. All of the above are Human beings every last one of them! People are not required to wear a badge as to their sexual preference, religion or country of origin, because people are just people.

It was especially hard for Katrina Henry, the woman who was captured in the viral video \u2014 and now she\u2019s speaking out about it. More than 750,000 people have watched video of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, woman\u2019s overdose since it was posted on Tuesday by a man who said he wanted to show the reality of the opioid epidemic. \"It makes me sick,\" Katrina Henry told CBS affiliate WDJT in Milwaukee. Distressed by what it showed, she said, \"That\u2019s not me. I would never do something like that.\" But in the grip of her addiction, she did. Jon Adams said he started recording after someone called 911 to get the woman help. \"People need to see. They need to see what happens,\" Adams said in the video. As the drugs overwhelmed her, Henry lost control and crashed into a parked car, unconscious behind the wheel. Luckily, no one was hurt, but Henry knows it could have been much, much worse. \"I can\u2019t bring myself to think about it,\" Katrina told WDJT. \"I do, and I hate myself so much.\" In the video, three paramedics surrounded Henry as she was lying lifeless on the pavement. After giving her several doses of Narcan, also known as naloxone, a prescription medicine that blocks the effects of opioids and reverses an overdose, Henry was revived. \"She almost killed herself,\" said Adams, as paramedics picked Henry up and carried her to a nearby ambulance.

Things started out a little rough on Saturday when she teetered off the balance beam during her Olympic trials, but ever since then, they've really been looking up. On Sunday she was selected to be one of the five women gymnasts to represent the United States at the Summer Olympics and, maybe even more exciting, on Monday she announced that she's being made into a Barbie. If you need one of these ASAP, it's completely understandable: here's where to buy the Gabby Douglas Barbie before they're gone. Douglas is only 20 years old, but she's already got a huge (and growing) fan club. The world-famous toy company, Mattel, just proved that it's a big fan of Douglas, too. Mattel was founded by a strong, go-getting woman, and the company has always made inspiring young girls to follow their dreams one of its biggest priorities. To that end, the company designed a series of dolls, called \"Shero\" dolls, to spotlight extraordinary, pioneering women. It has made dolls of ballet dancer Misty Copeland, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, and actress Emmy Rossum, according to the Huffington Post. Douglas will join this motley crew with her own, lifelike \"Shero\" doll.  Douglas seems pretty thrilled about the development (who wouldn't be?). She took to Twitter on Monday morning to announce the news. She wrote, \"Excited to debut my @Barbie Shero doll! Let\u2019s continue to break barriers & dream big, girls!\" In the photo she posted, Douglas is at the gym with her Shero doll. They're wearing identical track suits (the doll's is smaller) and she's posing her doll on a to-scale balance beam. It's pretty adorable. When she spoke with People, she expressed how honored she was to be memorialized in Barbie form. She said, \"I\u2019m so excited. My older sister and I used to play with Barbies and create these dramatic fantasy stories, so it\u2019s such a huge honor.\"  Mattel circulated a video interview with Douglas on its Twitter feed that also captured her excitement. She said that she's absolutely \"speechless\" that she has a doll. She added that she \"never would\u2019ve thought in a million years that I would be in this spot. Everyone sees me as a role model and it\u2019s just fantastic.\" Douglas is role model not only for her extreme athleticism (this will be her second time going to the Olympics), but also for her modesty and kindness.  In her interview she also shared how highly she thinks of all young women, no matter their interests and passions. The key, according to Douglas, is acceptance. She said, \"just be you and love yourself and embrace yourself.\"  As for adding this coveted Gabby doll to your collection, it's not for sale yet, but it will be at thebarbiecollection.com.", "UPDATE: The privacy settings on Claire Warner's photo have been changed, but if you'd like to see an example of the symptom she referenced, click here. Claire Warner \"never dreamt\" she'd be posting a photo of her breast on Facebook. Now, however, that photo has gone viral \u2014 but probably not for the reasons you might predict. Warner posted a close-up of her left breast to Facebook, revealing a seemingly innocuous dimple that could actually be a sign of breast cancer. \"This is a picture of my left boob,\" Warner writes in her Facebook post. \"The small purplish bruise is where I had a biopsy taken. The minuscule dimple up and to the left of it is a rare and little-known symptom of breast cancer.\" Though the most common symptom is a new lump or a mass in the breast, a dimple and/or puckering on the breast is also a sign of breast cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About one in eight women in the U.S. will develop breast cancer at some point. Warner explains that she flagged the \"blink-and-you'd-miss-it\" symptom \"exceptionally early\" thanks to another post shared by a friend, and is now sharing her photo as a warning to everyone else. \"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE check yourself (males as well as females) and get your loved ones to check themselves also,\" she writes. \"If I can help one other person, the way I was helped, then it's been worth showing my soon-to-be-reduced left tit to the world.\" After alerting her doctors to the dimple, Warner underwent surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and says she has \"every hope of being cured.\" At the time of writing, the photo has received over 25,000 shares on Facebook, with users commenting on Warner's ability to think of others in her own time of difficulty. \"You are amazing and strong and you'll be fine and even in this, you're putting others first,\" one user wrote. \"With you all the way.\" \"I will be checking mine, thanks for sharing this and wishing you all the best,\" another commented. If you spot something unusual on your breast \u2014 be it a lump, a dimple, or a change in shape or size \u2014 it's smart to heed Warner's advice. While official recommendations no longer suggest getting regular physical breast exams (or doing self-exams), experts do strongly advise being familiar with your own normal, and getting anything unusual checked out.", "The Hydraulic Press Channel has had a meteoric rise to fame over the past few months, simply by satisfying our appetite for mindless destruction and showing millions of people how amazing Finnish accents are. So far, it\u2019s squished everything from bowling balls to non-Newtonian fluid . But now they must face nature's hardest substance: diamond. The diamond was donated to the channel by a generous diamond retailer looking to jump on the viral bandwagon. As stated in the video, it\u2019s a 1.2 carat jewel and worth at least $4,000, complete with its own certificate to prove it\u2019s the real deal. So, as Lauri Vuohensilta \u2013 the mad genius behind the channel \u2013 says in the video: \"They say diamonds are forever, but how long?\" As it turns out, not very long. So, how was the diamond broken so easily? As some have pointed out, the \"hardness\" that diamonds are known for only really refers to their ability to be scratch-resistant. While the covalent bonds between the diamond atoms themselves are extremely strong, diamonds can also be brittle, especially if there\u2019s any kind of defect or it\u2019s been poorly cut. Scientists have even discovered materials that are actually harder than diamonds, such as wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still pretty impressive how swiftly the hydraulic press manages to shatter the diamond. That, and the \"bonus crushing\" of the plasticine model at the end is a particularly good one.", "More like Grandpa-lpatine. The conclusion of Star Wars: The Force Awakens left us all with one question: Who are Rey\u2019s parents? While many people believed the final shot was a clue to Rey being a Skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a Kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series. But a new theory has awakened: that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine\u2019s granddaughter. YouTuber Vincent Vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it\u2019s pretty compelling. There\u2019s the matter of their fighting styles. Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move. This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust. Rey\u2019s first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine\u2019s fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental. This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey\u2019s parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. For now. That\u2019s because Rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. While every fledgling Jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during The Force Awakens that point to Rey being tempted to the dark. In the film\u2019s script, it describes Rey as \"standing on the edge of the dark side\". During Rey\u2019s vision, Palpatine can be heard several times. Right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear Palpatine\u2019s scream, and further along, there\u2019s audio of Palpatine saying \"any Jedi\". There are a few other audio snippets included (Luke, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to name a few) but Palpatine\u2019s inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider Luke\u2019s lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. Why else would ol\u2019 Palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to Rey? The notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for The Force Awakens. In the portrait form, Rey\u2019s strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense. But when expanded out, Rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with Kylo Ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they\u2019re one. Finally, what about the accent? A lot of people used Rey\u2019s British accent as evidence that she could be a Kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. Yep. Palpatine. There\u2019s even more compelling evidence when you take into account clues from the film\u2019s script, the accompanying novel, and other hints from the film.", "The phenomenon of tiny homes just keeps growing year by year, and more and more small-space dwellers are spreading the word that the tinier the house, the better.

I know. People do horrible things to each other and often we are better off without someone. I will set these open and shut cases aside. What about the times where the guy (or woman) we are breaking up with is not right for us but is a thoroughly decent human? What if people do the best they can? What if those we select to share our lives with were well chosen and as such happen to be splendid people? What if they know us better than anyone? What if aside from lovers they are friends? What if we can manage to change the terms of our relationship with them without losing them? Aren\u2019t they worth rescuing? Shouldn\u2019t we consider turning our backs on the colorless narrative that a breakup means war, that a person we loved must become an enemy? If you want to break up with someone, please don\u2019t wait. Don\u2019t put it off because \"you don\u2019t want to hurt him\" or \"because it\u2019s not the right time\". You will hurt him. It\u2019s never the right time. Don\u2019t (ack) disappear or dwindle or attempt to fade into the horizon or send subtle signs or let the information trickle and \"speak for itself\". Please don\u2019t break up via text or phone. Break up in person, face to face. Then, be as direct and as clear as you can. While assembling these clear and direct words keep in mind that your priority is to preserve the other person\u2019s dignity. (And yours.) The person in front of you is someone you used to love and spend time with.

Who we are is a collection of everything. To do this moment justice, conjure the full picture. Assume, in your conversation but also in your thoughts, that what went wrong was you.

There might be a sort of idyllic image of farm involved somewhere, but by and large, the reality of how food \u2013 especially meat, dairy, eggs, and fish \u2013 gets to the table is shrouded in mystery. Awareness of the type of facilities where animals are raised is increasing, as more consumers actively seek out labels like \"pasture-raised\" and \"cage-free\" thinking they are in some way superior. But in the case of fish, things are a little less clear. In recent years, wild caught and farm raised has become a distinction between various types of fish found in the grocery store, but can most frequently be seen attached to salmon. The average American consumes two pounds of salmon a year, around two-thirds of which comes from farmed sources in China, Norway, and Canada. While wild-caught is largely self-explanatory, what exactly does farm raised mean in the context of fish, mainly salmon? Floating Pig Farms Around 40 percent of all fish consumed annually, are raised on aquafarms which can either be land-based or ocean-based. Land-based farms raise thousands of fish in ponds, pools or even concrete tanks, where ocean-based aquafarms house fish in isolated cages either off-shore or in the open water. In both cases, fish are overstocked and have little space to swim or display their natural behaviors, creating an extremely stressful environment. Around 40 percent of aquafarmed fish will die before they are harvested. And with good reason. Stocking thousands of fish in a small amount of space and feeding them protein pellets (ironically made from other fish) doused with antibiotics and chemicals, such as PCB, understandably makes for highly polluted water. If you\u2019ve ever had a fish and seen what it looks like when you forget to clean their tanks for a few weeks ... you can start to fathom the idea. Daniel Pauly, professor of fisheries at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, likens aquafarms to, \"floating pig farms.\"", "New York Jets safety Calvin Pryor sports a unique Star Wars-esque t-shirt, in the locker room following practice. Florham Park, NJ 12/16/15 (Saed Hindash | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) FLORHAM PARK \u2014 isn't just a hard-hitting safety in the Calvin Pryor isn't just a hard-hitting safety in the Jets ' secondary. He's apparently a hopeless romantic, too. Most people already know about the football part. All nearly got a glimpse into Pryor's love life, too. The 24-year-old told NJ Advance Media on Wednesday he was nearly the star of a bachelor-themed reality TV show this offseason. \"My agent called and asked me if I wanted to be,\" Pryor said. No, Pryor isn't joking. The concept of the show was going to be pretty simple: A handful of women \u2014 five or six, according to Pryor \u2014 would compete to win his heart. Pryor would take them on dates, and at the end of the series, he would pick which one he wanted. In a way, it's not much different than what Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is doing on his own reality TV show. \" Catching Kelce \" will debut on the E! channel Oct. 5. The show features 50 women try to earn Kelce's love. \"I thought it was a very cool idea with being on TV, the brand, and everything like that,\" Pryor said. \"It would have been fun to take all of them on dates.\" When Pryor's agent originally pitched him the concept, Pryor said he started to think of a few date locations and ideas. The show was apparently going to let him formulate his own plans for dates. The first was going to be a picnic, and the second a trip to the beach. He never got a chance to delve too much into the game planning, though. See, there's a minor holdup: Pryor isn't a bachelor. He has a girlfriend. And she wasn't too keen on him dating around. \"She cut me off before I could explain the details,\" Pryor said. \"I really didn't know if I could just do it for fun, or if it would have to be a serious thing. Once I asked my girlfriend, and she said 'no,' that ended that.\" Still, Pryor said he was flattered by being considered. \"What can I say?\" Pryor said with a smile. \"I'm a good-looking guy.\"", "Parents, they just don't understand. Right? Well, yes and no.  A new survey shows that when it comes to emoji, most seniors totally do get it. Except, that is, with one tiny eggplant-styled exception. SEE ALSO: Facebook's new emoji are finally available to everyone Great Senior Living, a site that focuses on senior care and retirement living, surveyed 500 people aged 55 and older on their emoji use and discovered that contrary to any ageist notions floating around, your parents and grandparents didn't just fall off the digital turnip truck. Over 86 percent of respondents had used emoji at least once, and a majority of them were deploying the pictographs in a manner we would deem to be correct.  \"One of the most recognized emojis by our respondents was the 'Hands Praying,'\" the findings explain. \"Almost 90 percent identified this emoji correctly, yet nearly 10 percent thought this emoji represented a high-five.\" It's totally legit to see \ud83d\ude4f and think either \"hands praying\" or \"high five\" (Emojipedia says this one is technically called \"folded hands\" and can be interpreted as either), and those surveyed were clearly in the know.   The areas where misunderstanding did occur were for the most part reasonable. The classic poop emoji? Seventy-six percent nailed it, but 18 percent looked at that swirly \ud83d\udca9 and thought ice cream. The peach emoji, commonly used to refer to a butt, fared a little worse with 42 percent thinking it meant \"feeling peachy\" and 35 percent thinking it was just a general fruit. This would help explain any \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udca9 texts from the parents \u2014 who doesn't love peach ice cream, after all?   The eggplant emoji, on the other hand, is apparently in need of a PR push.  SEE ALSO: Instagram won't let us interact with the eggplant emoji Sixty-nice percent (insert obligatory \"nice\") believed that \ud83c\udf46 referred to either cooking eggplant or vegetables. And, well, while they're not wrong exactly the youngsters of the world know what it really means.  Interestingly, 29 percent of those surveyed had no problem identifying the eggplant as \"in reference to a penis.\" Far be it from me to speculate, but I would imagine there is some overlap in that latter group and the ones who identified \ud83d\ude4f as a high five. Basically, just because you're over 55 doesn't mean you don't know how to party. Remember that, kids, because you won't be young forever \u2014 and as the hip emoji users of this survey make clear, getting on in your years doesn't mean the good emoji times need to stop. \ud83c\udf89", "An unemployed Oregon man got an extra sweet surprise after purchasing a box of cookies from Walmart last weekend.

Clothes, particularly hard-to-fit items like pants or bras, are difficult to buy online without trying them on first. So several websites, including Qvit.com, are trying to fix that by making the online shopping process as close to the in-store shopping process as possible. Qvit.com's unique development is the use of personalized avatars, allowing shoppers to \"try on\" clothes on an avatar resembling their exact bodies so they can see how the garments will look and even feel. The idea, says co-founder Laura Pastrana, came when she was in college. Dorming with a \"shopaholic\" friend who \"ordered and returned, ordered and returned everything she bought,\" Laura and her friends couldn't believe there wasn't a better way to see how clothing fit before ordering them online. \"We wanted to have a figure that replicated your body and that allows you to try garments on yourself, so like a virtual you, to see how a garment fits,\" Pastrana said in an interview with HuffPost Style. After years of development, in 2013 they finally came up with an avatar, a custom replica of the shopper's body, that allows her to try clothes in three different ways: 1. \"Mirror Image\" Gives the shopper a straightforward reflection of exactly what she looks like in the clothes, down to her customizable skin color. 2. \"Transparency\" Makes the clothes see-through so the shopper can see how closely or baggily they lay on her body. 3. \"The Heat Map\" Shows how tightly or loosely a garment fits with colors not unlike topography (red means \"so tight you can barely breathe,\" blue means \"there is more than one inch between the item and your body\"). The beauty of a customizable avatar, says Pastrana, is that it doesn't rely on predetermined body \"types\" so often used to guide women's shopping choices, i.e. if you're pear-shaped, buy this; if you're ruler-shaped, buy this. \"We're not looking for what designers believe is the perfect fit,\" Pastrana told HuffPost Style. \"We're rather looking for more of a desired fit, i.e. how I want to take it or how I want to wear it, how it reflects my lifestyle or my look or even my mood.\" She added, \"Sometimes, we women go 'Today I feel fat' or 'I feel ugly, so I want something more loose.' So it's usually not about what fits you exactly as much as what you want to wear.\" Amen to that. Qvit.com, which features a boutique-style selection of clothes for both men and women, ranging from $100 - $400, joins a group of e-commerce ventures such as My Virtual Model and \"Swivel\" by Facecake that aim to improve upon the online dressing room experience. Whether high-tech advancements such as avatars and stop-motion technology will ever make online shopping as appealing and user-friendly as the real life, in-person thing still remains to be seen.", "Share.

These ripples in the fabric of space-time, called gravitational waves, were created by the merger of two massive black holes 1.3 billion years ago. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) on Earth detected them on Sept. 14, 2015, and scientists evaluated their findings and put them through the peer review process before publicly disclosing the landmark discovery today. While this finding potentially opens a up a new way to learn more about how the universe works, there's one question in particular non-scientists seem to want answered: Can we finally travel through time now? Just imagine few years from now, hopefully time travel can be made possible. If only einstein was still alive. Rejoyce cosmos enthusiasts. \u2014 Mix (@lobotomixxs) February 11, 2016 @MattMichaelK Anything new found with space/time makes me think time travel is coming. Yes? \u2014 DJ Ol' Youngin (@EasterBunny_24) February 11, 2016 Time travel soon hopefully? https://t.co/BYSHL79hvT \u2014 Mike Masters (@recordmanmike) February 11, 2016 First of all, it's not a bad question. Think about space-time as a fabric that stretches through the universe and is affected by matter like stars, black holes, planets and other cosmic objects. Massive bodies warp space-time around them, creating what we feel as gravity on Earth. It would follow that learning more about it could lead to some kind of understanding of how to manipulate space-time to somehow travel through time. However, according to one well-known expert, this new gravitational wave discovery won't necessarily get us there. \"I don\u2019t think it [the detection of gravitational waves] is going to bring us any closer to being able to do time travel. I wish it would,\" said LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne during a press conference announcing the discovery. Thorne should know, given that he was also an executive producer on the 2014 film Interstellar. Even though we probably won't be able to surf a gravitational wave into the future or the past, this finding still means a lot for physics. The merger of the two black holes \"created a violent storm in space-time,\" Thorne said, allowing scientists to see the disruption in space-time as it passed through Earth's part of space. By confirming that gravitational waves are produced by the extreme collisions of massive objects in the universe, it gives scientists a new way to explore space. Instead of just looking at the cosmos in infrared, optical and ultraviolet light, researchers can now use gravity as another way to investigate. But the book isn't necessarily closed on the time travel question. Some scientists haven't yet counted out the idea that this discovery could lead to something unexpected way down the line. \"The discovery will allow us to explore space and time in a spectacular new way,\" physicist Brian Greene told Mashable. \"Might that one day yield breakthroughs in space travel or perhaps even in time travel? Who knows. But deep understanding is the first step forward.\" Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.", "What does it take to get to the top -- without losing your center? Our \"Making It Work\" series profiles successful, dynamic women who are standouts in their fields, peeling back the \"hows\" of their work and their life, taking away lessons we can all apply to our own. Fashion designer Nanette Lepore is known for her bright colors and feminine styles. Her dresses, jackets, swimsuits and shoes are sold internationally in 120 department stores, 360 specialty stores and 8 Nanette Lepore stores. When we spoke by phone earlier this month, I couldn't resist telling her that I wore one of her dresses in my engagement photos. But it wasn't always evident that Lepore, an FIT graduate, would make it in fashion industry. After working several jobs in New York, the Youngstown, Ohio, native started selling her eponymous line in a small shop in New York's East Village, taking her brand wholesale in 1990. Though she sold $250,000 worth of merchandise at her first trade show, she didn't have enough money to produce the clothes to fill the orders. \"My dad mortgaged his house and gave me the money,\" she says. \"We were paying [my dad] back every six months as we shipped new merchandise. Then one month I lost it all [when expenses outpaced sales], and it was devastating. I had to work for ten years to pay back my dad. My family thought I was going to lose the family house.\" Lepore says she and her husband, Robert Savage, managed to enjoy themselves despite the years of struggle. \"It was a fun, fun time to be in New York and to be young,\" she says of the late '80s and early '90s. \"I had a great husband, who was with me in the business. He would work at Ben Benson's steakhouse at night -- we had our health care through Ben Benson's -- and I would work sometimes till eleven. He would get me after his shift because I would be in the office alone and I'd be afraid to leave then.\" Lepore says the company grew at 20 percent a year from 2002 to 2008. Today, Nanette Lepore has about 100 employees, but family remains central to the company. Savage serves as CEO, and their daughter, Violet, collaborated with Lepore on a teen line for JCPenney. She also often joins her mom on the runway to close the fashion shows. Why do you do the work that you do? I realize in hindsight that it was a career in New York that was kind of wide open when I went into it. There was a small number of Americans -- Stephen Sprouse, Christian Francis Roth, Todd Oldham -- but it felt like a pioneer time. My shop was in the East Village between a soup kitchen and a gas station, and it was all galleries and drug dealers and crack viles. In the mornings, I'd be like, \"If my mother could see me now, she would die.\" There would be homeless guys sleeping all over the street because there was a shelter right there. We got robbed a couple of times. Oh my god, it was an adventure, and I loved that adventure. This business is rough, and I have to be involved in everything from what color zipper to how we're going to get the price down on a dress. But when I finally have a quiet moment in my design room and I'm working with a pattern maker, it's so rewarding. I get to be an artist. What work would you be doing if not this? I've always struggled with writing, but I would love to do it. But I would probably have ended up teaching. My parents were both teachers. What do your parents think about the way you work? My dad comes to every fashion show. My mom passed away a couple years ago, but she was very supportive. This is making me feel emotional. But they were really sweet about it, even though there were years when they didn't see it going anywhere. When it finally turned, they were so proud of me. What advice would you give your 25-year-old self? I do regret that I put off having a family because I was so busy trying to just hang on and build the business. I would have wanted a bigger family. But I would see these designers have kids and the next thing you know they'd be out of business because they would just be overwhelmed. I was cautious of that. But I think you can juggle it. If you're really the kind of person that's super-aggressive about what you do, you're going to make everything work. Also, I wish I would have saved a little more because now I want more money in the bank. How old were you when you had your daughter? Thirty-eight. I was getting up there. Then after that, trying to have a second one became a major situation. Have you ever had the big meeting or runway show coincide with the school play or something else related to your daughter? I've never missed a recital or a play, but her birthday always lands on Fashion Week. When she was little, she didn't know. One thing parents don't realize is up to 5 or 6, they have no idea. I would just tell her it was her birthday a week later. Now she\u2019s pretty good about going with the flow on her birthday. I just feel like I've missed quiet family time \u2013- my husband and her go to my county fair back in Ohio every Labor Day weekend, which I've never been able to do with her. Can you talk about the distribution of work in your home? Who does the cooking? The bill paying? The laundry? I have a cleaning lady that does the laundry, and my husband pays the bills. It's the cooking that's the struggle. For a while we had someone come in and cook on Sundays and fill the refrigerator. Then that started not working. Now I have to look at him earnestly and say, \"You really have to start cooking.\" I have to tell him in the morning, \"OK, you're going to have to go to the grocery store on the way home.\" My dad did all the cooking, but I married someone who doesn't do that. I work really late, so that's hard to get home and start dinner, so I like for him to start it at least. I hate for my daughter to eat a lot of carryout. I would say of our marriage, that's the biggest point of contention. Lepore with actor John Slattery and husband Robert Savage in East Hampton, New York. Do you get enough sleep? No, I don\u2019t. That's a problem because I'm so exhausted and then at midnight I'm wide awake. That's something to learn how to deal with. What do you do relax? I love lying on the floor and watching TV with Violet. I love getting out to the Hamptons and swimming. I do laps, but I feel like it's really relaxing and wonderful. I love to travel. We take family vacations once a year with my dad and my sister and her kids. I really think it's nice that my daughter gets to spend time with her grandpa. Do you think women have a responsibility to help other women at work? I do, and I don't like to find out when there's any kind of animosity or fighting amongst the women here. I like to believe that everyone gets along and that they're all pretty supportive. When I find out something strange, I'm always shocked because I feel like I have such a great, down-to-earth group of women. I lose my temper sometimes because I get overly stressed, and I always feel terrible when I do it. I like to keep a rapport where they know that I might lose it, but I don't hold a grudge or mean it. That's one of the things about being Italian. No one's ever talking in a regular voice, which is hard for people when they come from a family that didn't do that. It's just like I'll panic and then I'll get over it. I don't like when people have quiet grudges. That's harder to live with when you're in a situation where somebody's upset with you and you don't know why. I hate that kind of working environment. I'd rather be upfront with people and clear the air. Lepore (far right) with sister Michele Lepore Hagan, father James Lepore, husband Robert Savage and daughter Violet Savage in Capri, Italy. Do you have a work persona and a non-work persona? I think they're kind of the same. Sometimes I worry that I scare my daughter. I go home and I'm in the barking mood, and she'll look at me with this panicked face. I'm like, \"Oh god, I just scared her.\" Do you think women manage differently than men? Absolutely. My management style versus my husband's is majorly different. I have to be on the ground with the forces, and he manages like, \"I'm this person who is running things and so do what I tell you.\" I feel like if I need my girls to work until nine o'clock, then I'm gonna be with them. Do you think that there's still a glass ceiling? I'm always surprised when I hear about it because you think that women have made so many strides, but I do. Because there's so many cases where I could not have gotten money from banks or help from this person or that person without my husband picking up the phone. We're like, \"OK, this is the man job.\" There are men who want to talk to a man. In some cases, I would not have been as successful as I was without having a man who did the financial part of this business. He can say something as stupid as \"How 'bout those Yankees?\" and they immediately love him. It\u2019s like the old boys\u2019 club. Lepore (second from right) with husband Robert Savage, niece Natalia Lepore Hagan, father James Lepore and daughter Violet Savage in Galway, Ireland. Are you close friends with anyone you work with or have worked with in the past, or do you tend to separate your worlds? It's all one big mush. I like to go out with my staff because we have fun together, but we also can have dinner and talk in a more relaxed way outside of the office. I try to spend time with my director of retail, publicity, my store managers. They enjoy hanging out with me. I like to think they do. Do you have a \"work uniform\"? I like to change it up. I need to experiment with clothes. I need to make sure that clothes that I'm putting out there are everything I need. If it's not what I need, then I'm not serving my customer properly. I take home a whole new wardrobe every season and try to figure out what I missed and how I screwed up. I beat myself up every day if I find something wrong. \"Oh my god, I didn't make enough bottoms this time.\" \"We didn't make plain T-shirts.\" \"This dress doesn't fit right.\" \"This jacket was supposed to go with everything, and it only goes with one thing.\" Do you have a role model? I love Kirsten Gillibrand. I can't believe how much she keeps in her brain. I love Arianna because I can't believe how much she balances. I am in shock at how some people can know so many diverse facts about so many different things and be so well read. I'd love to be political, but then I start to open my mouth and I realize I'm just spouting opinion and I don't really have facts. Kirsten is amazing to me -- she's in Washington, she's raising a family, she knows everything about every issue. That kind of person I'm stunned by. What is your definition of success? Feeling satisfied with what you've achieved. Also, feeling like you love your job. And then just knowing that you have a really good support system, knowing that your family loves you and that you work hard together. According to that definition, do you feel successful? I do. I feel really lucky that I was able to know what I wanted to do, too, because I have so many friends and family that are going through life not really feeling like they ever found what they love. I feel really happy that I discovered what I love.", "Ever catch yourself rolling your eyes at your partner or getting a little too sarcastic during a conversation?

If you find yourself being contemptuous, stop and take a deep breath.", "Although much attention has focused on concussions in high school sports, shoulder injuries are common as well. And these injuries may vary by sport. A recent study found that football had the highest rate of shoulder injuries among high school students. The high school sport with the lowest rate of shoulder injuries was girls' soccer. Less than one in 10 high school students needed surgery for their injuries, and almost half returned to play within a week of their injury. This study, led by T. Walker Robinson, MD, MPH, of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, investigated shoulder injuries among US high school athletes. The researchers collected data about nine sports from a group of 100 nationally representative high schools for the school years ranging from 2005-2006 through 2011-2012. The sports included boys' football, soccer, basketball, wrestling and baseball, as well as girls' soccer, volleyball, basketball and softball. The researchers looked at the rate of shoulder injuries among the total number of \"athletic exposures,\" defined as a single athlete participating in a single practice or game. To qualify as a shoulder injury, it had to occur as a result of the sport, require attention by a trainer or doctor and either be a fracture and/or result in the athlete having to sit out at least one day from the sport. Out of a little more than 13 million athlete exposures, a total of 2,798 shoulder injuries were reported during the six-year study period. This number translated to approximately 2.15 shoulder injuries sustained for every 10,000 athlete exposures, which matches up with the approximately 820,700 shoulder injuries reported nationwide during this time period. The athletes experienced shoulder injuries three times more often during games and competitions than during practices. The sport with the highest rate of injuries was boys' football (almost five injuries per 10,000 exposures), while the lowest was girls' soccer (about 0.5 injuries per 10,000 exposures). Only about 8 percent of the injuries required surgery, with almost two thirds of the injuries being either a strain/sprain or a dislocation/separation. About 40 percent of the injured athletes experienced a strain or sprain, and 29 percent experienced a dislocation or separation. While only about 8 percent of the injured athletes ended up having to sit out the season (or their high school career) as a result of their injuries, about 41 percent returned to play within a week. \"Continued prospective surveillance is necessary to monitor injury rates, to gain further information about risk factors leading to shoulder injuries, and ultimately to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based interventions to prevent future shoulder injuries,\" the researchers wrote. This study was published January 13 in the journal Pediatrics. The authors reported no potential conflicts of interest. The research was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Federation of State High School Association, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, DonJoy Orthotics and EyeBlack.", "Earlier.. A deputy was stabbed and a prisoner is still on the run after allegedly escaping from a Detroit courthouse Monday morning. Police confirmed to The Huffington Post that a deputy was stabbed at the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in downtown Detroit around 8 a.m. The suspect, who was first identified as 25-year-old Derreck White, stabbed the deputy in the neck with a homemade shank made from a plastic comb and escaped with his uniform through an unguarded courthouse door. A statement from the Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon said Derreck White was actually an alias for Abraham Pearson, age 25. Pearson had three aliases, according to the local news station. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said that Pearson is a member of the \"Hot Boyz\" carjacking gang. Napoleon told the station that the incident occurred while the prisoner and two other inmates were being loaded into a cell. The prisoner allegedly turned a sharpened comb into a weapon, then took part of the deputy's uniform and used it to escape. The suspect then carjacked a 2000 grey Dodge minivan driven by a 58-year-old woman, who was unharmed, according to the Detroit Police Department. The escaped prisoner drove off in the vehicle shortly before being involved in a two-car accident while driving the minivan. A perimeter was established to find Pearson in an area near East Lafayette and Concord on the city's east side. The courthouse was under lockdown, but is now letting people back inside, according to the Detroit Free Press. The escapee is currently at large, and is said to be armed and dangerous. He is 5-foot-6 and weighs 155 pounds. He reportedly has a tattoo that says, \"Hot Boyz.\" The Free Press reports that Pearson was in court Monday to be sentenced on a host of charges, including carjacking, armed robbery, unlawful driving away of a vehicle, carrying a concealed weapon, felony firearm, possession of a firearm by a felon and possessing a financial transaction device. He was reportedly found guilty during a bench trial on Aug. 26. The suspect's defense attorney, James Howarth, said his client was found competent to stand trial despite having a history of mental illness, the Associated Press reported. \"In his right mind he would not have done this,\" Howarth said. \"In the year I have known him, he has never showed the slightest symptom of being dangerous.

The theme, \"My Best Day Ever...\" elicited 130,000 submissions . Brady's drawing told the story of her dad coming home after being deployed in Iraq for 18 months. Germick said that emotional connection is what he looks for in Doodles, first and foremost. \"One thing that\u2019s really nice is that this is not about having the most incredible rendering skills and being able to draw super 3D effects,\" Germick told Business Insider. \"This is about being able to express your humanity and your individual interests and passions through a piece of artwork.\" Sabrina Brady's Google Doodle, called \"Coming Home.\" Google", "By now, you've almost certainly seen the video of one extraordinarily lit Christmas parade featuring children's characters pulling some fantastic dance moves. From Twitter to The Shade Room, footage of these hype kid's favorites has gone super-viral, and reactions to the party have been extremely mixed. The video was taken at the Scotland County Christmas Parade in Laurinberg, North Carolina, where the characters danced down Main Street to energize the local crowd. The dancers are from company TandL-Characters, who provide their spirited performers for a range of celebratory events. \"We perform skits and dance because no one wants to go to a party [where] the characters only wave and take pictures,\" the company's founder, Lavonda McLaughlin, told Mashable, \"Our skits and music pieces are part of the company.\" While some viewers sounded off about finding the dancing inappropriate in the comments section of an article in The Laurinburg Exchange, McLaughlin defends her company's approach. \"Children love to dance - especially to the top songs that are played on the radio,\" she continued. \"There is nothing wrong with clean fun.\" Negative comments on the original video also prompted its poster (and hilarious commentator) to post this:  Upon receiving negative comments, \"The kids [who work for the company] were not happy,\" McLaughlin said. \"We have never had any negativity until we did the parade in Laurinburg, North Carolina.\" \"We are a family business,\" McLaughlin explained, revealing she runs the company with husband, Travis. \"We started because [our son] liked to dance, and he was good at it.\" Along with McLaughlin's own three children, the company consists of kids from Durham and Laurinburg, North Carolina, who are all close friends. \"Our team loves to dance and is very talented,\" she explained, \"They don't just see it as a job, they love entertaining and dancing too.\" Here is the company's own video of the event: Honestly, we think this Christmas parade looks fun AF.

When high school sweethearts Joe and Beverly got married, they were just 19 years old. As they drove away from the church in their 1948 Plymouth convertible, they looked forward to what the future would bring. For the Smiths, the future brought the threat of war. Joe ended up being drafted and going to fight on the Korean peninsula during the Korean War in the 1950s. When Joe came back, the Smiths started their lives. Joe and Beverly started a family and Joe eventually owned his own car dealership. When Joe and Beverly would talk about the past with their kids, one thing that always came up was the 1948 Plymouth convertible. Joe and Beverly had had to sell it when Joe went off to war, but it was still a source of happy memories. Realizing how much the car meant to them and with their 60th anniversary coming up, the Smith's son Joel decided that a 1948 Plymouth convertible would be the perfect gift. Joel scoured the Internet to see if anyone was selling one of the antique cars. He said he only found four for sale. The one he ended up purchasing belonged to an elderly man in Indiana. Joel arranged to have the car transported to upstate New York where the Smiths live. With the help of a few family friends, Joel was able to surprise his parents with the car.", "How Trump Won, According To The Exit Polls Enlarge this image toggle caption Genaro Molina/LA Times via Getty Images Genaro Molina/LA Times via Getty Images Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. That's remarkable for all sorts of reasons: He has no governmental experience, for example. And many times during his campaign, Trump's words inflamed large swaths of Americans, whether it was his comments from years ago talking about grabbing women's genitals or calling Mexican immigrants in the U.S. illegally \"rapists\" and playing up crimes committed by immigrants, including drug crimes and murders. But right now, it's also remarkable because almost no one saw it coming. All major forecasters predicted a Hillary Clinton win, whether moderately or by a landslide. So what happened? We don't know just yet why pollsters and forecasters got it wrong, but here's what made this electorate so different from the one that elected Barack Obama by 4 points in 2012. To be clear, it's impossible to break any election results out into fully discrete demographic groups or trends \u2014 race, gender and class are interconnected, impossible-to-disentangle phenomena. But, for now, here's what the exit polls, as reported by CNN, do tell us about a few of those trends that handed this election to Trump. Men backed Trump Women's voting preferences haven't shifted much since the time when they preferred Obama by 11 points. However, men swung more heavily Republican, by the latest exits. In 2012, men preferred Mitt Romney by 7 points. This year, they preferred Trump by almost double that. The exact counts are still likely to shift a bit but, right now, 24 percentage points separate America's women from America's men in the latest exit polls \u2014 that is, women preferred Clinton by 12 points, while men preferred Trump by 12 points. If that ends up being the final tally, it will be the largest gap measured by exit polls since at least the 1950s. Non-college-educated whites, in particular, love Trump Trump specifically appealed to whites during this election, and they clearly preferred him at the polls \u2014 right now, his margin of victory among them is roughly the same as Romney's in 2012, which was 20 points. But there's a massive fissure between college- and non-college-educated whites. Romney won non-college-educated whites by 26 points, according to polling data provided to NPR by the Pew Research Center. Currently, exit polling shows Trump's margin among that group to be roughly one-and-a-half times that. Meanwhile, college-educated whites appear to have preferred Trump slightly, according to current exit poll figures (which, once again, could still shift some). That would mean Trump moderately underperformed Romney, who won this group by 14 points, according to the data from Pew. However, that would still essentially be a win for Trump, considering that at one point, it looked like Trump might be the first Republican in decades to lose white, college-educated Americans. Clinton failed to perform in key counties Clinton underperformed Obama \u2014 sometimes heavily \u2014 in key counties in swing states. For example, Obama beat Romney by more than 381,000 votes in Wayne County, Mich. \u2014 by far the state's most populous county. Clinton beat Trump there only by around 287,000 votes, meaning there's a more than 90,000-vote gap between her win and Obama's win there. In Cuyahoga County, Ohio \u2014 home to Cleveland \u2014 Trump drew about 4,500 fewer voters than Romney did in 2012. However, Clinton drew almost 37,000 fewer, giving her a much smaller win there than Obama scored in 2012. In Milwaukee County, Wis., where it appeared Trump had a much bigger early lead (as we reported earlier), the gap closed considerably as the hours wore on, to around 6,700, by the latest data. Likewise, Clinton trailed Obama's margin in Philadelphia County, Pa., by around 10,000 votes. Those aren't huge gaps, but they do reflect the broader national trend of Clinton losing a bit here, a bit there ... adding up to a loss. Conservatives don't seem married to traditional conservatism Right now, the numbers for conservatives are looking about the same this year as they did in 2012 \u2014 that is, around 80 percent of them went for the Republican candidate in both elections. And in both, they made up just over one-third of the electorate. But, then, Trump is not at all the kind of conservative that Romney was; indeed, he's not at all a traditional conservative. Trump has rejected free trade agreements, called for up to $1 trillion in government spending on infrastructure, and introduced a tax plan that could balloon the debt by $7.2 trillion in one decade, by one estimate. That makes it pretty clear that Trump voters weren't driven by far-right ideology (unless many self-proclaimed conservatives had big changes of heart since 2012). Trump's populist, overtly masculine, anti-PC appeal helped him vault past Clinton. With the GOP controlling both the Senate and House, the question now is how Trump will square his brand of conservatism with that of his congressional counterparts. Those leery white evangelicals? They weren't so leery after all Right now, the polls show that 81 percent of white, self-described evangelicals voted for Trump. That doesn't look too different from 2012, when 78 percent of white, born-again Christians (a term that pollsters often use in place of, or in conjunction with, the term \"evangelical Christians\") chose Romney. All of which is to say that despite white women evangelicals' apparent reluctance to choose Trump, and despite some evangelical leaders' arguments against Trump, this group in the end didn't shift much at all. Trump did well among voters who didn't really like him You'd think that when people see a candidate unfavorably, they'd vote against that candidate. That didn't happen this year \u2014 at least, not the way it did in 2012. In 2012, 94 percent of voters who saw Obama unfavorably chose Romney. Likewise, 92 percent who saw Romney unfavorably chose Obama. But as Amy Walter pointed out at the Cook Political Report Tuesday morning, 77 percent of voters who saw Trump unfavorably voted for Clinton; 15 percent of those people still voted for him. The numbers were slightly less stark among Democrats \u2014 only 82 percent of people who saw Clinton unfavorably chose Trump; 11 percent chose her anyway.

If you find it unpleasant, that's the point. The Australian government hired research agency GfK to redesign cigarette packaging in 2012, and they determined (with seven studies and 1,000 regular smokers) that this was the most deterring color to pair with the anti-smoking graphics.

Mats Linander 2015-03-19 - New York Betteridge\u2019s law of headlines famously asserts that any headline that end in a question mark can be answered by the word \"no\". This \"law\" is of course no law \u2013 creating a counter-example is trivial \u2013 but should rather be seen as a tongue-in-cheek remark on how poor journalism sometimes hides behind dubious headlines. In this post we\u2019ll try to answer to what extent Betteridge\u2019s law applies to current articles on the internet. Using the scripts in this repository , we have crawled 13 separate news sites for a total of 26000 headlines (2000 per site) and tried to answer the 766 of them that end in question mark. Headline polarity A polar question is a question for which the expected answer is either \"yes\" or \"no\". We find plenty of these among our 766 headlines, but also plenty of non-polar questions. Roughly 46% of the 766 headlines ending in question mark are non-polar. They are not yes-no questions, so the answer can\u2019t be \"no\". As such, they contradict Betteridge\u2019s law. Yes and no but also maybe Even though Betteridge\u2019s law clearly doesn\u2019t hold for all headlines, could it be that the remaining 54% all have the answer \"no\", thereby making the law mostly correct? We did another sweep through the polar headlines to find out. There are also a number of headlines that we failed to answer. For instance, the BBC asks if India is the next university superpower but does not define what \"university superpower\" means. It doesn\u2019t seem impossible that India could become that, whatever it is, but we can\u2019t really say if it\u2019s more likely to happen than not. Hence, the answer to this, and to several other questions, will have to be \"maybe\". Among the \"maybes\" there\u2019s a whole plethora of reasons why a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" wasn\u2019t provided. In some cases, like above, we doubt anyone can really say. In other cases the answer is probably out there somewhere, but we failed to find it. And there are of course also various sports related questions that we couldn\u2019t muster up the energy to research properly. Interested readers can check out the raw data set for a closer look. With 46% non-polar and 20% answered \"yes\", at least two thirds of our headline sample violates Betteridge\u2019s law. We conclude that it cannot be \"mostly correct\" either. Conclusion We\u2019re going to go out on a limb here and guesstimate that the remaining \"maybe\" answers can, given enough time and effort, be turned into \"yes\" or \"no\" answers, and that these will be distributed similarly to the 20:17 ratio of the fully answered headlines. That would put the total ratio of \"no\" at 25%. In other words, it appears as if roughly a quarter of all headlines which end in a question mark can be answered by the word no. You can go ahead and call that Linander\u2019s law of headlines, if you will.", "So we started doing the school supply shopping this week. A daunting task even as the kids get older and the lists get shorter. Gone in my house are the days when the most expensive item on the list was the ever-elusive \"just this size\" binder. Now, we\u2019re talking calculators that rival my electricity bill. But I sigh, watch the ads, and get out there and do it. I put on my thickest armor because nothing will be just right for my kids. The kitty folders are too childish; the more mature ones are $200 a piece. Add to that the hysterical mobs crowding the $1 pencils like they were the last chance to win tickets to a 21 Pilots concert, and we have a joyfest that keeps on giving. (Insert sarcastic eye roll here). Yes, I\u2019m frustrated. And let\u2019s talk about that list, shall we? I mean, who in their right mind thinks it\u2019s a good idea to request that our kids purchase Expo markers in bulk or boxes of Kleenex that should be supplied already? ESPECIALLY when those might not get used by my kids? Who thinks it should be my job to bring Ziploc bags to school? Well, I\u2019ll tell you who. This mom. I\u2019m not going to buy just the one extra box of tissues because (let\u2019s all be honest here) I can afford more than that. And *gasp* what if someone other than my precious Timmy uses them? Well, then, haven\u2019t I done a good deed for the year for less than the cost of a coffee? We should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kids, for all these little people who will be making big decisions some day like what to do with YOUR Social Security or how to fix YOUR city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in YOUR body. If you don\u2019t agree with something on the list and think it\u2019s excessive, have a conversation with the teacher. I guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children, the teacher will be able to explain how. Yes, Expo markers are expensive. Get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes ON them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo. You think you have to buy too many glue sticks? I invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that gives the kids one more opportunity to understand all the \"-augh\" words and their various pronunciations and watch multiple children go through half a stick just for that one project. More is more, right? And yes, the theory is that you teach them to use less, but let\u2019s be honest: some just use what they use. Watch kids \"clean\" the floor at the end of the day and, in a rush to get home, throw away all the \"trash\" they found, which includes half used pencils and crayons that would take too long to find a home for. So, let\u2019s fast forward to January. The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren\u2019t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. Dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. And then what happens? Supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid\u2019s teacher\u2019s cart at Target during a grocery run. And forget the $10. Oh no. Multiply that sucker by \u2013 how many kids were in that classroom? Was it 20? 30? Let\u2019s see. Does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? And if it\u2019s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn\u2019t that extra $10 a little worth it? I\u2019m frustrated by our entitlement. We act like we\u2019re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers. Umm, let\u2019s back up a minute. Aren\u2019t they the ones doing us the favor? I mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can\u2019t find a glue stick to finish his project? And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don\u2019t learn as well then. I\u2019m frustrated that we can\u2019t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. Buy the extra box of tissues. Do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones. Be frustrated with me for the right reasons.", "- Jennylyn Mercado will be playing the role of Steffi Cheon\u2019s character in the Filipino adaptation of the Koreanovela hit \u2018My Love From The Star.\u2019 - Director Joyce Bernal confirmed the casting herself during a short interview with PEP.ph - No names were given on who will play the part of Matteo Do, the male lead in the drama Filipino Koreanovela fans, rejoice! Expectations just got higher for the Filipino adaptation of \u2018My Love From The Star\u2019 as Jennylyn Mercado was confirmed for the role of Steffi Cheon, the female lead role. In an interview with PEP.ph (Philippine Entertainment Portal) on Friday, August 7, the director of the remake herself, Joyce Bernal, disclosed the confirmation on the casting. Fans were excited to see Mercado\u2019s take on the role given her acting reputation. Fans were excited for Mercado\u2019s next project on TV. The remake of the fantasy-drama from 2014 was highly anticipated given its fresh plot and top ratings not only in Korea but in other countries as well. In the story, an alien who landed on Earth during the Joseon Dynasty in Korea lived up to 400 more years to meet the love of his life in the character of Mercado, a top actress in the modern era. In line with Steffi\u2019s character, the director was asked if the training of the actress with Jonas Gaffud had something to do with the role. Jun Ji-Hyun originally played the character of Steffi. It can be remembered that just last month the photo of the actress with the famous personal coach of previous Filipina beauty queens including current Miss Universe Pia Wurtzbach went viral. Even though fans speculated that it has something to do with Mercado\u2019s next drama role, no confirmation has been made until then. Bernal stated that since Steffi was supposed to be \u2018model-like,\u2019 Gaffud was perfect for the training. Earlier this year, \u2018Pambansang Bae\u2019 Alden Richards was rumored to play the character of the male lead, Matteo Do, but it seems like the winds have changed. If the director was confident before in mentioning Richards for the role, she wasn\u2019t as sure as she was now \u2013 saying that she has yet to convene with GMA-7 on October to discuss the matter. Fans initially requested Alden to portray the male lead. Given the actor\u2019s commitment with his current love team with Maine Mendoza, fans have started suggesting other male actors for the role of Matteo. Kapuso actor Kiko Estrada, politician-son Jake Ejercito, and model Richard Juan were some of the names tossed in the pool of possible candidates. Jennylyn Mercado previously starred in a Star Cinema film with John Lloyd Cruz entitled \u2018Just the 3 of Us.\u2019 It was directed by acclaimed director Cathy Garcia-Molina, who was also the woman behind box-office hits \u2018One More Chance\u2019 and \u2018A Very Special Love.\u2019", "Supergirl is coming to Lego Dimensions late next month, but she\u2019s not coming easy. Not only is Superman\u2019s cousin a PlayStation 4 exclusive, her figure will only be available in Starter Packs, the full edition of the game most fans already own. One of my favorite things about Lego Dimensions up until this point was a distinct lack of platform-specific content. While Disney Infinity had retailer exclusive variants and Skylanders did the whole Wii/Wii U/3DS Nintendo crossover thing, Lego Dimensions was all out there, save for the odd convention circuit exclusive (I will have you, Green Arrow.) Starting late in September, Supergirl will come bundled alongside Batman, Wyldstyle and Gandalf in the PlayStation 4 Starter Pack for Lego Dimensions . What this means, is that if you already own a Starter Pack (which ran $99 at launch but have slipped down to around $60 or less lately), you\u2019ll have to buy another one for Supergirl. Supergirl packs all the powers of Superman\u2014flying, super strength,x-ray vision and eye-beams, and is also able to transform into Red Lantern Supergirl, adding rage bolts and constructs to her repertoire.

There\u2019s nothing that can shock me anymore, but at this point, Trump\u2019s made it very clear how his temperament is, how his personality is, what his level of intellectual depth is when it comes to policy, and he\u2019s made it abundantly clear that he\u2019s utterly unqualified to be president\u2014no matter what your political views are.\" He continued, \"his entry into being a Republican was questioning the citizenship of the first black president.

For the two metropolises whose bids fall short, stunned disappointment will surely descend, as city leaders bemoan a lost economic opportunity. Yet this inevitable reaction fails to account for a little-understood reality of the Olympics as catalyst for urban development: In seeking to host the games, coming in second tends to work out better, say economists who have studied this phenomenon. The runner-up tends to invest in the same sort of infrastructure aimed at impressing the Olympic committee, such as roadway improvements and modern signage, which assist in spurring trade and commerce. But the No. 2 choice then gets spared the expense and hassle of actually hosting the games. The result is a surge of productive investment in the early stages, and an avoidance of the sort of white elephant construction projects that get built right before the games commence. \"There is no way that it\u2019s in your national interest to host the games, but it may be in your interest to bid for the games,\" said Andrew Rose, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-wrote a 2009 paper on the economic benefits of hosting the Olympics. According to Rose\u2019s research, countries that hosted the Olympics between 1950 and 2006 saw a 30 percent jump in international trade thanks to measures they took while they were trying to impress the IOC -- including political decisions like opening up trade or allowing freer exchange in the national currency. It might sound like a good argument for hosting, Rose said, were it not for the fact that bidding countries not selected saw an economic impact \"every bit as big as the effect of actually hosting the games.\" The positive outcome for the runner-up nations reflects the nature of the Olympic host bidding process, Rose said. In the multi-year campaign for Olympic glory, countries generally take productive steps to open and modernize their economies. \"You want to send a signal to the world and to your own populace that you\u2019re opening up, that you\u2019re an important part of the world, and hosting a mega-event is one way to do that,\" Rose said. \"Of course, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t have to pay for it.\" Stephen Billings, a professor of urban economics at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, N.C., has similarly studied the economic gains seen from hosting the Olympics. His conclusion: Cities that get as far as the finalist stage are already winners. \"There\u2019s no real difference between runner-up cities and the ones that are eventually selected,\" Billings said. He explained that, in nearly all cases, cities bidding to host the games spend the years before the final IOC decision building up their infrastructure, a dynamic that yields positive economic fruits. In fact, many economists have said that having the games rarely benefits the host nation at all. Once they actually win the bid, cities spend massive sums on stadiums and Olympic villages that often prove less useful in the future. The expensive projects tend to experience massive cost overruns as construction deadlines approach. And security costs running into the billions of dollars have made the possibility of running a profitable Olympics even less likely in a post-9/11 world. Of the three cities currently vying for the Olympics, Madrid has presented a self-described \"low-budget\" option, costing an estimated $5 billion. The city says it will rely heavily on existing infrastructure and will only need to build four stadiums for the event. Some 19 new Olympic Village apartment blocks will be reused as housing projects once the games have left town. Those projections haven\u2019t stopped critics on the country\u2019s political left from labeling the event, being sought at a time when Spain is facing Depression-level unemployment and a foreclosure crisis, as \"The Hunger Games.\" Istanbul has pulled out all stops, proposing a $19 billion budget for the Olympics. Tokyo\u2019s proposal involves $8 billion in projected expenses. An April report by the IOC team scored various aspects of each city\u2019s bid, giving an edge to Madrid and Tokyo, with preliminary scores of 8.08 and 8.02, respectively. Istanbul received a score of 6.98. \"Nearly all academic economists who aren\u2019t connected to the IOC agree that the Olympics are extremely expensive events and that cities have almost no chance to make up those costs,\" said Victor Matheson, a professor of economics at Holy Cross University in Worcester, Mass., who has also studied the issue. There have been exceptions, Matheson noted, including profitable games in Los Angeles in 1984 and an Olympics in Barcelona in 1992, which helped transform the Spanish metropolis from an industrial second city into one of Europe\u2019s most important tourist destinations. But those cases are highly unusual: Los Angeles presented a low-ball bid that was accepted by the Olympic Committee for lack of better options. Barcelona \"had the perfect combination for the event,\" Matheson said -- \"a hidden gem city that had a lot to offer tourists, but wasn\u2019t well-known to the world.\" The people pushing for their cities to be Olympic hosts are not ignorant of these facts, Matheson said, but they may convince themselves their city is the next Barcelona. \"It\u2019s almost like what they say about a second marriage: It\u2019s the triumph of hope over experience,\" Matheson said. Andrew Zimbalist, a professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., takes a dimmer view. His extensive research on the topic has shown him that cities most likely to win Olympic host bids are the ones with opaque political institutions captured by special interests, he said. \"The city that wins is likely the one that has outbid everyone because they have a lot of construction companies and construction unions, and maybe lawyers, and maybe investment bankers who are looking to float the loans, all pushing hard for this,\" Zimbalist said. \"It\u2019s a self-perpetuating Olympic juggernaut.\"", "Facebook stalking gets you moody, and the terror of an accidental 'like' in the 'Kavos 2k13' album means the practice is probably best avoided. Looking through endless live feeds of people's carefully curated best moments probably isn't the best way to make you happy. After all, lifestyle comparison against the best everyone else has to offer, is not a fair contest. Regardless, how do you find out who's been checking up on you? Facebook has just added a new feature, which is startlingly similar to one found on rival platform Snapchat, that allows you to find out. The company said that they will never permit features that allow other users to see who viewed their profile, which happens in networks like LinkedIn. However, the new 'Stories' feature on the Facebook app allows you to see who has viewed your stories and specifically which parts of it. Much like Snapchat lets you know when people view your stories. Or like Facebook-owned Instagram, which introduced the feature after it saw the success on Snapchat. Or like Facebook Messenger. Or Facebook-owned Whatsapp. Facebook has prominently placed the feature in all its apps now, begging the question; why do you need four different versions of the app on your phone, just because they don't like a little social media competition? In fact, why do you need an app that just exists to flog crap to you through ads and sell your data and personal information to advertisers?", "We all have a roll of aluminum foil somewhere in our kitchen drawers or cabinets, but we never think to use it on our body!

And while Snapchat has the cachet of being the originator of the Stories format, the closed nature of its platform means that it lacks the same network effects as Instagram. If Snapchat wants to succeed against Instagram in the long-run \u2013 in both the domain of ephemeral sharing and more broadly in social media \u2013 then it might need to take a leaf from its rival's Instagram page and emulate the open-nature of its network. Network effects cause a product's value to compound as more users buy in. Every successful social platform (including Snapchat) owes its prosperity to network effects. As more users sign up, there are more people to connect with and more content to interact with. This increases the benefits of being the platform, which keeps existing users on platform and attracts new sign ups. On the other hand, flailing social networks fall short because \"they never caught on\" and hit critical mass, while extinct social networks die out when no one uses their platform anymore. The openness of Instagram's platform and its superior user base give it a key advantage over Snapchat. Instagram counts over 300 million daily active users (DAUs), almost double that of Snapchat. Users on Instagram can thus potentially tap into a much larger audience. Moreover, Instagram's platform is open and encourages the discoverability of new content, which helps the audience-building endeavor. In contrast, Snapchat's is more closed and difficult to find content on unless you already know exactly where to look.", "Haryana Health and Sports Minister, Anil Vij  is at it again.

The affordability and openness of Google's ecosystem offers huge advantages over Apple's closed iOS. But I understand the case for iPhones: They're reliable, always up to date, and (mostly) just work. Ask the average iPhone user why they stick with Apple's increasingly boring, expensive lineup though and the answer is simple: They're used to iOS. It's simple, beautiful, familiar, and easy to use. Trying to convince one to switch to Android is almost like trying to convince a Windows or OS X user to switch to Linux (the niche, techy PC operating system on which Android is in fact based).

Different apps will be able to set different trust score thresholds at which you can use them. This plan could largely kill the lock screen, finger presses, and other obstacles built into the current every day experience of phone use. In other words, it will make the average Android much more simple and easy to use than the average iPhone. Do I think that will be enough to unseat Apple's throne atop the luxury phone mountain? No. But a huge majority of the world's smartphone users already use Android devices.

Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum Most of the world didn't know anyone lived in the highlands of Papua New Guinea until the 1930s, when Australian gold prospectors surveying the area realized there were about a million people there. When researchers made their way to those villages in the 1950s, they found something disturbing. Among a tribe of about 11,000 people called the Fore, up to 200 people a year had been dying of an inexplicable illness. They called the disease kuru , which means \"shivering\" or \"trembling.\" Once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. First, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people Once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. First, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people called it the \"laughing death.\" Within a year, they couldn't get up off the floor, feed themselves or control their bodily functions. Many locals were convinced it was the result of sorcery. The disease primarily hit adult women and children younger than 8 years old. In some villages, there were almost no young women left. \"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says \"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says Shirley Lindenbaum , a medical anthropologist with the City University of New York. But what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After But what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After ruling out an exhaustive list of contaminants, they thought it must be genetic. So in 1961, Lindenbaum traveled from village to village mapping family trees so researchers could settle the issue. But Lindenbaum, who continues to But Lindenbaum, who continues to write about the epidemic, knew it couldn't be genetic, because it affected women and children in the same social groups, but not in the same genetic groups. She also knew that it had started in villages in the north around the turn of the century, and then moved south over the decades. Lindenbaum had a hunch about what was going on, and she turned out to be right. It had to do with funerals. Specifically, it had to do with eating dead bodies at funerals. In many villages, when a person died, they would be cooked and consumed. It was an act of love and grief. As one medical researcher As one medical researcher described , \"If the body was buried it was eaten by worms; if it was placed on a platform it was eaten by maggots; the Fore believed it was much better that the body was eaten by people who loved the deceased than by worms and insects.\" Women removed the brain, Women removed the brain, mixed it with ferns, and cooked it in tubes of bamboo. They fire-roasted and ate everything except the gall bladder. It was primarily adult women who did so, says Lindenbaum, because their bodies were thought to be capable of housing and taming the dangerous spirit that would accompany a dead body. \"So, the women took on the role of consuming the dead body and giving it a safe place inside their own body \u2014 taming it, for a period of time, during this dangerous period of mortuary ceremonies,\" says Lindenbaum. But women would occasionally pass pieces of the feast to children. \"Snacks,\" says Lindenbaum. \"They ate what their mothers gave them,\" she says, until the boys hit a certain age and went off to live with the men. \"Then, they were told not to touch that stuff.\" Finally, after urging from researchers like Lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. The case was closed after a group at the U.S. National Institutes of Health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later. The group, which Finally, after urging from researchers like Lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. The case was closed after a group at the U.S. National Institutes of Health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later. The group, which won a Nobel Prize for the findings, dubbed it a \"slow virus.\" But it wasn't a virus \u2014 or a bacterium, fungus, or parasite. It was an entirely new infectious agent, one that had no genetic material, could survive being boiled, and wasn't even alive. As As another group would find years later, it was just a twisted protein, capable of performing the microscopic equivalent of a Jedi mind trick, compelling normal proteins on the surface of nerve cells in the brain to contort just like them. The so-called \"prions,\" or \"proteinaceous infectious particles,\" would eventually misfold enough proteins to kill pockets of nerve cells in the brain, leaving the cerebellum riddled with holes, like a sponge. The process was so odd that The process was so odd that some compared it to Dr. Jekyll's transformation to Mr. Hyde: \"the same entity but in two manifestations \u2014 a 'kind', innocuous one and a 'vicious', lethal one.\" The epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic \u2014 the difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue.

Though the Fore stopped the practice of mortuary feasts more than 50 years ago, cases of kuru continued to surface over the years, because the prions could take decades to show their effects. According to According to Michael Alpers , a medical researcher at Curtin University in Australia who tracked kuru cases for decades, the last person with kuru died in 2009. His team continued surveillance until 2012, when the epidemic was officially declared over. \"I have followed up a few rumoured cases since then but they were not kuru,\" he wrote in an email.

Dr. Ermias Belay, a prion disease researcher with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says that's the only scenario in which there is \"definitive evidence\" that humans can develop a prion disease after eating the infected meat of another species. But, he says, there are still a lot of open questions about how and why humans get prion diseases. For one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place \u2014 the Jekylls that can be so easily turned into Hydes. One leading hypothesis, Nature , is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves. For one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place \u2014 the Jekylls that can be so easily turned into Hydes. One leading hypothesis, described recently in the journalNature, is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves. But here's the bigger question, says Belay: \"How many of these diseases actually jump species and affect humans?\" Kuru showed that people could get a prion disease from eating infected people. Mad cow disease showed that people can get a prion disease from eating infected cow. But what about other prion diseases in other animals? Could, say, hunters get sick from eating infected deer? That's what researchers in North America, including Belay, are trying to find out right now. \" Chronic wasting disease in North America is spreading fast,\" says Belay. The disease causes infected wild deer and elk to starve to death. \"In early 2000, we had about three states that reported CWD in the wild in deer and elk. Today , that number is 21.\" Belay says the disease is \"a little bit concerning\" because, unlike mad cow disease and kuru, where infectious prions were concentrated in the brain and nervous system tissue, in an animal with chronic wasting disease, the misfolded prions show up all over the body. They can even be found in saliva, feces and urine, which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk. The CDC is working with public health authorities in Wyoming and Colorado to monitor hunters for signs of prion disease. \"Unfortunately, because these diseases have long incubation periods, it's not easy to monitor transmission,\" says Belay. He says he and his colleagues have yet to find any evidence that hunters have picked up chronic wasting disease from the meat of infected wild animals. \"And that, in itself, is good news for us,\" he says.

To break that agreement, the town paid Nugent half of his guaranteed performance fee of $32,000 from Maude Cobb's annual budget. The move comes amid criticism of comments Nugent made about President Barack Obama in January 2014, calling him a \"subhuman mongrel.\" Nugent, who campaigned with Texas Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott amid the controversy, apologized for those comments in February.

If so, some of the company\u2019s staff say there\u2019s a reason for the longer waits: the coffee chain has been cutting back on worker hours, leading to declining service in stores. As a money-making business, Starbucks has been on a roll lately \u2014 the coffee chain reported another quarter of record sales and profit last week. So it baffled many of the company\u2019s hourly employees in the U.S. when, as business boomed this spring, they noticed a dramatic change: they weren\u2019t getting enough hours of work. Eight Starbucks employees from several cities around the country told BuzzFeed News that since May, the number of work hours assigned to stores by the chain\u2019s Global Labor Scheduling (GLS) system has fallen far below both what they need and what they normally receive. The change came with no warning or explanation from executives; some staff say their schedules were cut in advance, while others have been sent home during their shifts. Many have taken to social media to complain, with some threatening to quit. ID: 9323172 If you have information or tips, you can contact this reporter via email at venessa.wong@buzzfeed.com ID: 9323177 It\u2019s an unexpected turn for the Seattle coffee chain, which has long considered itself an employer of choice in a fast food industry infamous for bare-minimum pay and benefits, and demoralized workers. An internal communication portal used by the company has received numerous complaints from staff \u2014 \"partners,\" in Starbucks lingo \u2014 about reduced hours and declining morale, according to screenshots provided to BuzzFeed News. BuzzFeed News source ID: 9321991 Starbucks told BuzzFeed News there has been no change in labor strategy and managers are being asked to handle staffing as needed on a store-by-store basis. \"We are not trying to reduce labor. We want our stores staffed in accordance with what they each need,\" said spokesperson Jaime Riley. Yet an internal company email reviewed by BuzzFeed News, which was sent to field leaders in May, suggests the company is closely watching labor expenses across the chain as growth slows. It said the weeks in May and June following Starbucks\u2019 Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion are \"historically challenging weeks to forecast and schedule as the business experiences a significant decrease in transactions, resulting in an overspend in labor.\" The email asks field leaders to help control this overspending using a new \"forecasting tool\" that would \"adjust forecasts and compensate for downward trend in business.\" \"\u2018Reducing overspending\u2019 seems like good business sense,\" Riley, the Starbucks spokesperson, said in response to the email. Starbucks staff told BuzzFeed News that store managers use the company\u2019s GLS software to determine how many worker hours they can allocate. The managers input how many transactions they think their location will ring up for a given week, and the system generates an allocation of total labor hours, using an algorithm that also takes into account historical sales. The store manager then assigns those hours to individual workers. But in recent months, staff say that managers noticed their estimates were returning fewer hours. Just by way of illustration, if an estimated 800 transactions usually earned a store 70 hours of labor, the store might now receive only 65 hours for the same estimate. \"Someone seemingly flipped a switch on the labor model,\" one manager who has worked for Starbucks for nearly a decade told BuzzFeed News. \"The whole month of July has been the tightest in scheduling I\u2019ve ever experienced,\" said another longtime manager. Starbucks sales, despite reaching new highs, have fallen short of expectations for the last nine months. The chain experienced a slowdown in U.S. sales growth from April to June \u2014 sales at cafes open at least 13 months increased by 4% compared to 8% during the same period last year. The company has called its recent performance an anomaly and expects its domestic business to pick up again. \"With costs of raw coffee going up and minimum wage rising, they will be looking for cost efficiencies anyplace they can find them,\" said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones.

Riley, the company spokesperson, said the chain has received \"overwhelmingly positive\" feedback about a U.S. pay raise announced this month, which moves a scheduled pay bump forward from next January to this October. On Monday, Starbucks confirmed to BuzzFeed News that it will also pay a $500 bonus to employees who have been with the company for at least two years. When it comes to the perceived cutback in hours, \"we encourage partners to work with managers on staffing scheduling needs,\" Riley said. A number of Starbucks workers \u2014 many who said they used to love their jobs \u2014 have shared their stories online about the effect of reductions in hours. Here are some condensed excerpts. \"Cutting labor is all-consuming.\" \"Because our store manager is contacted constantly about hours, we are asked to send labor updates at 12p, 4p, and 8p every day. But even if we end up 100+ transactions over forecast and have already cut hours, we\u2019re told we should have cut more. My store continually meets and exceeds the confusing, sometimes nearly impossible goals set forth by a computer system and people who are 1,000 miles away.\" - Leslie \"Labor cuts are definitely taking a toll on us.\" \"Although my schedules say 20 hours, since labor is being cut I can never hit the 20 hour mark. That means I don\u2019t qualify for benefits. My husband\u2019s 40 hours a week [at Starbucks] have turned into 29 hours a week. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard to think about the next schedules being put up, and dreading looking at he number of hours we are getting. Trying to calculate how much money we need to make just to get the kids fed, keep the lights on, and gas in the car. No one wants to give up hours, which means picking up shifts is getting harder and harder because everyone is scrounging for hours..I\u2019ve never seen such an aggression about labor before. Over five years, and I\u2019ve never had to truly worry about my hours, they stayed consistent..with the occasional \u2018You wanna go home early today?\u2019 But now it\u2019s \u2018You have to go home, we are way over on labor.\u2019 ... In the past six months, I have heard more about numbers and labor than I have in the five years I\u2019ve been with Starbucks.\" - Caylee \"It didn\u2019t feel like work at all at first. All of that changed a few months ago.\" \"I noticed we seemed to be short staffed more often and it always felt like we were all flustered or moving at a dizzying pace. I also became a shift supervisor about a month ago. Advancing in my position is a huge change as it is. Add in even less people to work with but having the same volume of customers, and I am so physically and emotionally exhausted that my job is not even fun for me anymore. Want to know the last time I had a lunch break during one of my eight hour shifts? I couldn\u2019t even tell you since it has been so long ago. In fact, today I worked a nine hour shift on the floor with just one five-minute break, long enough to take a few sips of my iced vanilla chai and eat a doughnut.\" - Stephannie \"My hours have gone from 26 to 29 hours a week to 20 to18 hours a week.\" \"With only two people on the floor at a cafe, we can barely keep up, as the lobby is neglected and bathrooms and customers are complaining. I plan to hang in there but a lot of partners have no choice but look for other employment.\" - Vickie \"I recently had a baby, and was on an extended maternity leave due to complications. When I returned to work, hours were getting cut too much.\" \"Short night shifts, cut down to two hours because of being sent home early, were too much. We were closing the highest volume store in the city with only three employees in the tourist area of town. It was a constant battle of being sent home early, or scrambling all night, unable to get everything done. Driving 30 minutes to work wasn\u2019t worth it, especially for the poor pay as a barista with a newborn at home.\" - Bailey \"I like working hard. I like being busy.\" \"However, the reality is that if I spend my morning on the floor with six or seven people who are killing themselves to fill customer orders that really call for eight or nine baristas (mostly because [Global Labor Scheduling] doesn\u2019t adequately account for things like multi-part orders or food [orders]), I\u2019m exhausted by the time I get home. Beyond that, being overworked and understaffed hurts partner morale. It makes it so that stores not as clean and pleasant as they should be, and customers are not taken care of in the way that they deserve to be.\" - Noel \"Every transaction is rushed through as the line continues to grow!\" \"Orders are put on the bar where our solo barista makes every single beverage as fast as possible while trying to focus on what they are doing whilst grabbing all those stickers from cafe, drive-thru, and [mobile order and pay]. The drive thru times are suffering horribly; our average ticket is six to eight drinks each car! It looks bad on the company from a guests perspective to have three or four partners on the floor when the place is absolute chaos.\" - Samantha \"I came into this company in January and I loved my first few months.\" \"But you can see it in our faces and demeanors how much it\u2019s taking its toll. And now I received a paycheck for not even $200 that is nowhere near enough to pay my rent and bills. This so for two weeks work!!! Our store has failed two [Quality Assurance Standards Assessment] audits in the month because it never stays clean enough because we never have enough people to maintain the store. We never have schedules ready until a few days before the next week starts. Deliveries are made and stay there for days because on two man sets who\u2019s going to put it away. We\u2019re just exhausted, disappointed and now angry that all of our hard work is being taken for granted. I can\u2019t survive on this dismal pay and only 15 to 20 weekly tips. I\u2019m going to have to cut off my medical insurance and stop 401k just so I can make ends meet! I love my job but I can\u2019t survive in this atmosphere!\" - Andre ID: 9323188 If you have information or tips, you can contact this reporter via email at venessa.wong@buzzfeed.com", "In December 2012, when Michelle Schroeder-Gardner graduated with an MBA, she had $38,000 in student loan debt. She got a job as a financial analyst earning $50,000 a year (plus bonuses of about $12,500 annually), but she set a goal of paying off her debt within six months. Though it took her one extra month, paying off a huge amount of debt in a short period of time set her on a path of financial over-achievement. Since then, she has increased her income each year. In 2013, excluding her salary from her full-time job, which she quit that year, she earned $117,000. In 2014, that increased to $164,000. In 2015, her earnings jumped to $321,000. And last year, she made just shy of $1 million   $979,000, to be exact. Plus, the 27-year-old is a digital nomad. She and her husband live in an RV, chasing 70-degree weather (they were in Arizona when we spoke in late January) and enjoying the views of a slew of national parks including Colorado National Monument, Mesa Verde, Rocky Mountain, Arches, Moab, and others. Her ticket out of debt and into financial freedom has been her blog, Making Sense of Cents, where she offers tips on saving and making money   and publishes income reports. Michelle Schroeder-Gardner of the Making Sense of Cents blog and her husband, Wesley Gardner (Courtesy of Michelle Schroeder-Gardner) It also doesn't hurt that she is naturally frugal. Even though I make $100,000 a month, I'll still wear my favorite shirt even if it has a hole in it, she says. But the biggest reason for her success may be her internal drive. I've always been super competitive, she says. I would always win at a board game or jump rope the most, little things like that, and people would often joke, Michelle's going to be president one day, or Michelle's going to be a millionaire one day, because I was always so competitive, determined, and independent. Her friends and family also thought she would be successful because she always helped others with their problems. Growing up, I was always super determined, so I don't think anyone was surprised with how successful my blog was, she says. It was always expected of me   that I'd do something pretty out of the norm. Here's how she paid off her debt and grew her income so quickly. How did you pay off your student loans so quickly? Six months before I graduated, I received a letter stating how much I would owe every month when I graduated. It was going to be $500 a month or so. I don't remember the number, but it was a number I felt was way too high for my income. I decided I didn't want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life, so I figured I would try to pay it off as quickly as I could so I didn't have to worry about it 10 years from now. I figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later. So in addition to being a financial analyst, I also did a bunch of side jobs. Altogether, I was working 100 hours a week. My side jobs consisted of taking surveys, mystery shopping, doing staff writing, doing research phone calls for companies and other things. As soon as I earned any extra money, I put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldn't be sitting in my bank account and I wouldn't be thinking of other ways to spend it. What were your expenses during this time? My boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and I had bought a house when we were 20, and our mortgage was less than $1,000, but I had other regular expenses like transportation, groceries, etc. We also had combined our finances, so it helped that we shared our bills. When did the blog start coming into the picture? I had actually started my blog in August 2011, before I graduated with my finance MBA. I got the idea one day when I was reading Cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site Daily Worth. I started reading that website and I became super-interested in personal finance blogs. I started my blog as a hobby. I didn't start it thinking I'd make an income from it. Six months later, I made my first $100 from my blog when a blogger friend who was already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser. I didn't even know blogs could make money. Until then, my blog had genuinely just been fun for me. But once I realized I could make money, it boosted my motivation. I sought out deals and wanted to see if companies wanted to sponsor my blog. Also, companies would approach me. When my blog had been just a hobby, they would approach me, but I would ignore all those emails. Once I realized I could make money from my blog, I took them more seriously and gave them my rates. At that time, I charged $100 for a sponsored post on my blog or $150 for an advertisement on my sidebar.  I also made a little bit on Google Adsense and affiliate income, where I was promoting other companies' products, and if one of my readers bought through me, the company would pay me. My advertisers were mainly financial companies like coupon websites and cell phone apps and other services that helped people save money. At that time, it wasn't so much banks, but I do have bank advertisers now and I charge them much more than that of course. I also started looking for opportunities writing for other bloggers and immersing myself into the blogging community. How much did you earn from the blog to begin with? In the beginning, in May of 2012, I earned $500. And by December 2012, I was up to $5,700 that month. The month I paid off my student loans, July of 2013, I earned $11,000 that month. How exactly does the blog bring in money? Now, I'm making money in much different ways from just a few years ago. Before I was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and that's the bulk of my income. There are 15-20 companies I actively promote on my social media and blog platform. The other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which I teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income. In November 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income. I created that because I had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings. Now it's more a form of passive income, since I already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done. My third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising. In those instances, maybe I partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling. Or I participate in a Twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms. Why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016? In 2015, I decided to stop doing all my freelancing. I stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business. I was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but I realized I truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others. By focusing on my business, I was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30%. I also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well. It only took me a few months after I dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income. I was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when I decided I was going to focus just on my own business, then I made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where I am now at $100,000. How has your changing income changed your lifestyle? As a full-time blogger I have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time. My husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time I quit mine in October 2013 when I was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too. At the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time. The main lifestyle change is that we live in an RV, are location-independent and work wherever we can. We sold our house in Missouri in July 2015 and now we work from wherever. Why did you start living in an RV? My husband has always wanted to live in an RV, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an RV. There's always a joke in the RV community that there's always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it.  That's pretty much how it was. But I stepped into an RV one day   we just decided to look at one   and I loved being in it. So we decided to give RVing a shot. It was just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trips, but we came to love it and never went home. We would be gone for a month or two at a time, so we just decided to turn the RV thing into a full-time venture and haven't looked back since. How big was your house?  We had a finished basement, and so if you count that, 2,500 square feet. If you don't, it was 1,200 square feet with three bedrooms. How big is the RV? It's 400 square feet if you include all the slides being out. Did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff? Yes, the Salvation Army came and took a bunch of stuff, and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliances and junk and we had neighbors come and just take whatever they wanted for free. We kept clothing and photo albums. How does living in an RV make your finances different from other people's? It doesn't really change. Our RV cost more than our house, but RVing can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be   just like with a normal home. There are cheap RVs, and there are RVs worth millions of dollars. It's comparable to living in a home, but I have a different view all the time. There are free places to stay, but we mainly choose private campgrounds or state parks that cost money. We usually stay in one place for a month. We like to follow the weather, so we like to stay in a forever 70-degree weather area, and we like to follow activities we like such as riding our bikes outside and going for a hike, so 70-degree weather is what we're looking for all year long. How has all this newfound wealth changed you? I'm not as stressed about money as I was just a few years ago. But I'm just as frugal as before. It's not below me to use a coupon. I just don't like to be wasteful. If there's a way to save money, I'm not going to waste time to find ways to save money, but if a money saver is there, I'll go for it. How has your wealth changed your relationships? It really hasn't changed them too much. We're often told that people are surprised we're the same and that you would expect people making $100,000 a month to not be as nice or down to earth. But many of our friends still call us down-to-earth. How was money handled when you were growing up and what habits or attitudes did you carry into adulthood?  My mom wasn't super good with money, but my dad was better, so I learned what to do from him. He taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly. A lot of people think credit cards are the root of all evil, but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn rewards points with them. I'm still very frugal. I don't pay for any form of TV, I don't have cable, Netflix, Hulu or anything like that. We haven't spent any money on TV since February 2015 to save money and also to not spend as much time watching TV. I feel like there's plenty of things to watch on local channels. If I had any more channels, I'd be in front of the TV all day long. How much time do you spend on your blog? Between 40 and 60 hours a week. I work longer hours when I'm trying to get far ahead in my blog content. I currently do three blog posts a week. Do you have help? I do have an editor who edits my site and a tech person to make sure my site is always up and live and no one is hacking it. What do you do with your extra income?  We invest a lot in Vanguard funds and are saving for retirement one day. By next year, we should have plenty of money to retire early if we chose too. But I still love blogging, so I don't see that ending anytime soon. For the next few years, we plan on RVing here and in Canada, and then afterward sailing full-time and go to other countries. I'd have to find ways to manage my internet access. But we do know many bloggers who blog full-time and sail, so it's not impossible.", "When it comes to posing for Vogue covers, there's no denying that Kate Moss knows what she's doing. But directing the fashion spreads inside the glossy? Well, that's a whole new project... one it seems the 33-time cover girl is eager to embark on. British Vogue announced today that Moss will make her mark on the magazine's masthead, joining the publication as a \"contributing fashion editor,\" beginning with \"a forthcoming spring issue.\" This reminds us of Carla Bruni's guest-editorship of Vogue Paris last winter -- except way better. First off, this isn't a guest spot, but a recurring role. And Kate's not just a fashionable lady, she's an industry veteran who has proven adept at modeling, designing and even singing (well, sort of). As a matter of fact, editing might be one of the few creative pursuits she hasn't tried. The question remains: How well will Kate's captivating presence translate behind the lens, where she won't have those stunning facial features to fall back on? Vogue UK's Alexandra Shulman has faith: \"Her undoubtedly brilliant sense of style, depth of fashion knowledge and understanding of what makes a wonderful image will be exciting to see on the pages of British Vogue,\" she told her magazine this morning. \"I am really looking forward to working with her on ideas.\"", "Here's some not-so-great news, considering many of us will be moving into chillier weather in the upcoming months: New research shows that cold weather might not be good for our hearts. Two new studies, presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2013, show that cold weather not only seems to be linked with heart risk factors, but it also seems to be associated with more heart attacks. The first study, conducted by Dr. Pedro Marques-Vidal of Switzerland, shows that heart risk factors, including high blood pressure, cholesterol and waist circumference, seemed to be higher than average in the winter months -- particularly January and February -- and lower than average in the summer months -- particularly June, July and August. The findings are based on data from 10 studies from seven European countries, which included a total of 107,090 people between the ages of 35 and 80. For example, systolic blood pressure levels (the top number on a blood pressure reading) were 3.5 millimeters of mercury lower, on average, during the summer than the winter. Meanwhile, waist circumference was 1 centimeter, on average, smaller during the summer than the winter. Total cholesterol was 0.24 millimoles per liter lower, on average, during the summer than the winter. \"We observed a seasonal variation in waist circumference but BMI did not change throughout the year,\" Marques-Vidal said in a statement. \"We have no clear explanation for this finding. Total cholesterol may increase during the winter because of changes in eating habits. There was no seasonal variation in glucose, probably because several cohorts did not collect blood samples in the fasting state. We have begun a study on seasonality of food intake which may help explain these findings.\" In the second study, conducted by Belgian researcher Marc Claeys, an association was found between lower temperatures and increased heart attack risk. Specifically, heart attack risk went up by 7 percent for every 10 degree Celsius drop in temperature. However, researchers were unable to find any link between heart attack risk and air pollution, contrary to other research. The study is based on data from 15,964 people who had experienced heart attack, with an average age of 63. \"A potential mechanism to explain the increased risk of coronary events associated with decreasing temperature is the stimulation of cold receptors in the skin and therefore the sympathetic nervous system, leading to a rise in catecholamine levels,\" Claeys explained in a statement. \"Moreover, increased platelet aggregation and blood viscosity during cold exposure promotes thrombosis and clot formation.\"", "A Washington state couple was shocked after they found out they had been babysitting a kidnapped child. John Tuong originally ended up babysitting the boy after his sister asked him to watch her boyfriend\u2019s son. Tuong\u2019s sister promised to return the next day, but never came back for the boy and didn\u2019t respond to Tuong's text messages. \"It\u2019s probably the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\" Tuong told Komo News. \"It\u2019s like something out of a movie.\" Authorities issued an Amber Alert on Tuesday night after learning that the toddler had been kidnapped from his home in Des Moines, Washington. Tuong and his wife had no idea about the kidnapping until the next morning, when Tuong was eating breakfast and happened to see an Amber Alert on his Facebook feed. \"All of a sudden I see this Amber Alert for this child,\" Tuong said. \"And it looks like this child in my bed, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God!

According to authorities, the sister and the child\u2019s grandmother allegedly went to the boy\u2019s home, incapacitated his mother with a Taser and drove the mother to a house in Fife where they tied her up in a garage. The mother escaped and ran to a neighbor's for help, Komo News reports. She was not seriously injured during the kidnapping. According to Tuong, the boy was a great kid and didn\u2019t cry much. He enjoyed the company of Tuong\u2019s dog and his own children. Tuong noted that he can\u2019t believe his sister got wrapped up in such a horrible situation with her boyfriend. \"Honestly I'm at a loss for words right now,\" he said. \"It's just crazy.\" Photo Credit: Komo News", "It is known by many names. \"Opaque couche\u0300.\" \"Pantone 448C.\" \"Death.\" But now it can add one more name to its infamy: The ugliest color in the world.

This is the biggest out of the three DLC packs released so far and Bethesda has claimed that it\u2019s their largest DLC pack landmass wise. The developers have released a plethora of DLCs for its games and since it\u2019s a traditionally RPG-based game development company, many of its DLC packs have been massive. Claiming that Far Harbor is huge has definitely got the community talking. Fraghero has now created a time lapse video of one our editors walking across the entire map of Far Harbor at the slowest pace possible. Make no mistake, the map\u2019s huge and it took us almost 30 minutes to go from one end to another, but is it truly the biggest yet? It is certainly the biggest when it comes to Fallout games, no other DLC released for any Fallout game comes close, but when compared to another Bethesda developed DLC for Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, it isn\u2019t quite the biggest. Shivering Isles took almost 50% more time when compared to this DLC pack, with the final time coming to around 45 mins mark. To be fair, it\u2019s still quite a large map and Bethesda\u2019s really delivered a meaty DLC pack in the form of Far Harbor. People are still discovering new things in the DLC and the overall feedback has been positive.

The phone is already labeled as the iPhone 8, it has already reportedly been confirmed by an Apple employee. DON\u2019T MISS: One of the iPhone 8\u2019s hottest new features was just unveiled by another company The unnamed employee spoke to a Business Insider reporter, sharing some details about what Apple is developing in the region. The employee said that staff in Israel are working on what\u2019s coming next in Apple\u2019s product line, including the iPhone 8. \"The worker used the term \u2018iPhone 8\u2019 unprompted in our conversation,\" Business Insider writes, which was a surprise because the next expected iPhone name would be iPhone 7s. The employee said the iPhone 8 will be \"different\" than the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, which would explain why Apple would be willing to skip the iPhone 7s next year. One other explanation for ditching the iPhone 7s moniker next year is that Apple will celebrate the iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary, and a product name that would contain the \"S\" letter in it might deliver the wrong message \u2014 that the new iPhone is essentially a minor iPhone 7 upgrade. The person also revealed that the iPhone 8 will have a better camera than the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, which is something expected from new Apple smartphones. Business Insider notes that there are 800 employees at Apple\u2019s Herzliya office, which was set up after Apple bought flash memory designer Anobit in 2012 and 3D sensor developer PrimeSense in 2013. Apple has also acquired Israeli camera firm LinX since then, and its technology might be used in the just-released iPhone 7 Plus. The facility works on chips, storage, cameras and wireless technology, sources close to Apple said. The Herzliya office is Apple\u2019s second largest R&D facility in the world, according to what Tim Cook said during a trip to the country in 2015.", "Katy Perry is willing to move past her bad blood with Taylor Swift as long as she hears one little word: sorry. On Saturday, the \"Firework\" singer took some time from her busy schedule to answer questions from fans on Twitter. When someone asked if she would ever work with Swift, Perry responded with a short and simple answer. \"If she says sorry, sure,\" she said. Twitter The feud between Perry and Swift goes all the way back to 2014, when the latter told Rolling Stone about an unnamed fellow female pop star who \"tried to sabotage an entire arena tour.\" It\u2019s this female pop star that \"Bad Blood\" was written about. \"She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me,\" Swift said. \"And I\u2019m surprisingly non-confrontational \u2013 you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her.

The process is still under evaluation. As soon as we learn more, we will share news.\" Clearly, issues remain unresolved between Sony and Bethesda Game Studios in regards to console mods, and with no release date or form of announcement in site, the PS4 community is becoming restless and impatient. Here\u2019s to hoping something\u2019s said soon.", "Narcissistic personality traits seem to have risen as quickly as obesity in recent years. Entitlement has become a defining characteristic of millennials, and everything from selfies to the everyone-gets-a-trophy mentality has been implicated in increased narcissism. Yet in and among all of the social commentary and scientific research about narcissism, one important question remains unanswered: What happens when a generation of narcissists becomes parents? Narcissism is a personality pattern characterized by a lack of empathy, increased levels of grandiosity and entitlement, and a chronic seeking of admiration and validation. In her book, Should I Stay or Should I Go? Surviving a Relationship with a Narcissist, Ramani Durvasula details 30 character traits of narcissism, but she says superficiality, greed and vanity make up its central core. \"It\u2019s like all of the deadly sins rolled up into one person,\" Durvasula says. Everyone is a little bit narcissistic. Narcissism is part of being human, and it\u2019s a standard developmental stage for adolescents and young adults. When narcissism begins to interfere with how a person functions at home and work, though, it becomes problematic and can even veer into the realm of a personality disorder. Narcissists genuinely believe they are unique and entitled to special treatment, and they have a chronic need for admiration and validation \u2014 at any cost. \"Most of us grow out of thinking we are Superman at 6 years old,\" says Durvasula. \"We shouldn\u2019t be running around like that at 41.\" Children don\u2019t offer the type of continuous positive feedback narcissists crave, and narcissistic parents tend to react in one of two ways. Durvasula and W. Keith Campbell, a professor of psychology at University of Georgia and an expert on narcissism, say some lose interest in their children entirely and look for other sources of validation. Others view their children as a reflection of themselves and become hyper-involved and controlling. In both cases, disconnection is the key; even the overly involved narcissistic parent is emotionally detached and lacks warmth. The impact of being raised by a narcissist isn\u2019t well documented on an individual level, and it\u2019s been even less studied on a societal scale. Campbell has written more than 100 scientific articles and three books about the narcissism epidemic, but he admits parenting is a gaping hole in our understanding of narcissism. \"We very rarely study the parents\u2019 narcissism and then predict what will happen to the kids,\" says Campbell. This lack of formal research doesn\u2019t mean experts such as Campbell don\u2019t have theories, however. \"One thing you would see with narcissistic parents is using their kids as a route to self-advancement,\" he says. \"As a narcissistic parent, you look good and feel good because of the success of your kid. The same way that a narcissist can have a trophy spouse, you can have a trophy kid.\" Narcissistic parents have high expectations of their children \u2014 and plenty of them. They push their kids to excel in sports, do well in school, attend elite universities, and work in high-status careers. Narcissistic parents believe their children are special and deserving of special opportunities and privileges, and they refuse to tolerate anything less than perfection. They view their children as a part of themselves \u2014 \"like their arm or their leg,\" Durvasula says \u2014 and when their children aren\u2019t achieving, they withdraw their affection and become disconnected. Children aren\u2019t equipped to handle that disconnection from their primary caregivers. They need parents who are consistent, available and unconditionally approving to form secure attachments. As adults, we rely on these secure attachments formed in childhood to dictate how we relate to others, view ourselves, and even cope with stress. When the formation of that secure attachment is disrupted, the impacts can last a lifetime. Jennifer Doig knows the pain of having a narcissistic parent. Her mother was a classic narcissist, alternately abandoning her and expecting her to hold the household together. Now an adult with children of her own, Doig still struggles to carve a path separate from her mother\u2019s expectations. \"I feel like I\u2019ve worn a mask my entire life\" she says. \"I need to be who I am and I don\u2019t even know who that is. That\u2019s a hard place to be when you\u2019re 41 years old.\" Sara Shaugh was also raised by a narcissist. She says her mother focused on her appearance and weight intensely, and groomed her from early childhood to marry a rich man. When Shaugh was in the hospital with a brain injury and a broken neck and back after being hit by a car, her mother\u2019s top priority was Shaugh\u2019s appearance. \"One of the first things she did was call my hairdresser because my hair was a mess,\" Shaugh recalls. \"This was before they even knew if I was going to live or die. But what was really sick about the whole thing was the whole time I was thinking, \u2018Maybe now my mother will love me because she almost lost me.\u2019 \" These stories aren\u2019t unique. \"Narcissistic parents beget kids with a whole host of psychological problems,\" Durvasula says. These problems include higher than average rates of depression and anxiety, lack of self-regulation, eating disorders, low self-esteem, an impaired sense of self, substance abuse and perfectionism. And we don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. The narcissism of other parents creeps into how the rest of us raise our children. Narcissists\u2019 relentless focus on their children\u2019s accomplishments creates competition among children and between parents. Even the \"mommy wars\" have their root in narcissistic parenting, Campbell says. Most people who get caught up in competitive parenting aren\u2019t narcissists. Durvasula points out that we live in a competitive culture where success is measured by good grades, elite colleges, wealth and status rather than someone\u2019s levels of empathy and compassion. \"We have created a world where it\u2019s almost impossible to get ahead unless you\u2019re a narcissist,\" Durvasula says. Even parents with the best intentions get pulled into this cycle. Most parents who lobby to get their children into elite schools, hire college application coaches or push kids to get straight A\u2019s sincerely want to help them advance in a society with limited options and a growing divide between the haves and the have-nots. But this focus can instill narcissistic traits in children unless parents balance competition with empathy and compassion. Another danger is how the focus on materialism and status shifts the parenting barometer for everyone. When narcissistic parents buy their tweens expensive smartphones and throw their teenagers elaborate sweet 16 parties, their overblown displays of affection become desirable to other kids. Parents don\u2019t want to disappoint their kids, so they give in and buy their children the same things. Pretty soon, it becomes abnormal for tweens not to have smartphones, and narcissistic parents have to find even more elaborate ways to show their affection. Millennials aren\u2019t to blame for the growth in narcissism (despite all of the flack they get). It has its roots in the dawn of the individualism movement in the 1800s, but technology has taken hold of that growing trend toward individualism and made it a way of life. Now, consumers expect an online shopping experience tailored to their preferences and television customized to their viewing habits. Every aspect of the online world is centered around the individual, and growing numbers of Americans spend the bulk of their waking hours online. \"Even in places like Starbucks without computers, there are 30,000 ways to have your coffee,\" Campbell says. \"It makes us feel like individuals, and we feel special.\" This belief in being special is at the root of narcissism, and it\u2019s where healthy self-esteem and narcissism diverge. When researchers at Princeton University studied the roots of narcissism in children, they found that it was predicted by parental overvaluation of their children. Children became narcissistic, at least in part, by internalizing their parents\u2019 inflated ideas of them \u2014 and narcissistic parents are notorious for doing exactly that. There\u2019s no simple formula for predicting who will become a narcissist, or how a child will react to being raised by one. Upbringing matters, but genetics and a child\u2019s personality traits factor in. Fewer than half of the children of narcissists in Durvasula\u2019s practice became narcissists, but there\u2019s no large data pool of adult children of narcissists to study \u2014 for now. Durvasula expects this generation to give psychologists plenty of research fodder. \"One thing I can guarantee you is [children of narcissists] will be plagued by doubt and insecurity the rest of their lives,\" she says. \"The question is how that is going to manifest.\"", "Los Angeles Unified moved forward Tuesday with the second phase of its plan to equip students with iPads, but added a pilot test of laptops -- a signal that the district's ambitious technology project may extend beyond tablet computers. The plan, approved by a 6-1 vote, was the hybrid of a detailed resolution by east San Fernando Valley board member Monica Ratliff and a request by Superintendent John Deasy to take the next step in eventually equipping all 600,000 students with some type of device. In the end, it was Deasy himself who merged his plan with Ratliff's and addressed the various board members' visions and concerns about the troubled first phase of the rollout and where the district should go from here. \"I was glad I was able to reach a compromise with board member Ratliff and continue to advance the opportunities for students,\" Deasy said after the 21/2-hour discussion. Ratliff's proposal addressed security breaches and other issues raised by schools participating in the first phase, which got under way this fall at 47 schools. She wanted to get all of the problems worked out and a detailed analysis made before proceeding with Phase 2 -- a process she estimated would take until next summer. She also wanted to buy laptops -- not iPads -- for some high schools to determine whether those devices would better fit the instructional needs of those students. But Deasy persuaded her and the other board members to allow him to push ahead with Phase 2, which involves the purchase of iPads for 35 schools, plus every teacher and administrator -- a total of about 70,000 devices. Each elementary school will also get a mobile cart holding a number of iPads, so students can participate in field tests scheduled in March of the online assessments aligned to the new math and English standards taking effect next fall. The district will also buy iPad keyboards for the middle and high schools participating in Phase 1. That purchase had been delayed when the first contract was awarded because officials were convinced they could get a better deal if they waited. At the insistence of board member Steve Zimmer, officials also vowed to take a hard look at the contract before moving forward with the purchase of the iPads for Phase 2. He was convinced, he said, that LAUSD hadn't gotten the best deal when it agreed to pay $678 for each tablet, which comes pre-loaded with instructional software being developed by Pearson Education Inc. Tuesday marked the first time that Deasy has actively participated in the discussion about iPads. He previously had been excluded because he owned about a dozen shares of Apple stock, but he since sold those. With little discussion, the board approved that $30 million contract in June to buy iPads for kids and teachers at 47 schools. But the creation of a technology committee chaired by Ratliff -- and stubborn questions about security, cost, instructional materials and parental responsibility -- prompted a more thorough review as the board prepares to award contracts for the next phase of the project. About 30,000 teachers and students at 47 schools received iPads this year, the first phase of the gradual rollout. Under a revised timeline announced in mid-October, 36 schools would be tapped for Phase 2, getting the tablets by April. Phase 3 would see tablets distributed to 200 schools next fall, and 250 additional campuses in spring 2015. The remaining schools would get tablets in fall 2015. ___", "DENVER (AP) \u2014 Police officers across the country misuse confidential law enforcement databases to get information on romantic partners, business associates, neighbors, journalists and others for reasons that have nothing to do with daily police work, an Associated Press investigation has found. Criminal-history and driver databases give officers critical information about people they encounter on the job. But the AP's review shows how those systems also can be exploited by officers who, motivated by romantic quarrels, personal conflicts or voyeuristic curiosity, sidestep policies and sometimes the law by snooping. In the most egregious cases, officers have used information to stalk or harass, or have tampered with or sold records they obtained. No single agency tracks how often the abuse happens nationwide, and record-keeping inconsistencies make it impossible to know how many violations occur. But the AP, through records requests to state agencies and big-city police departments, found law enforcement officers and employees who misused databases were fired, suspended or resigned more than 325 times between 2013 and 2015. They received reprimands, counseling or lesser discipline in more than 250 instances, the review found. Unspecified discipline was imposed in more than 90 instances reviewed by AP. In many other cases, it wasn't clear from the records if punishment was given at all. The number of violations was surely far higher since records provided were spotty at best, and many cases go unnoticed. Among those punished: an Ohio officer who pleaded guilty to stalking an ex-girlfriend and who looked up information on her; a Michigan officer who looked up home addresses of women he found attractive; and two Miami-Dade officers who ran checks on a journalist after he aired unflattering stories about the department. \"It's personal. It's your address. It's all your information, it's your Social Security number, it's everything about you,\" said Alexis Dekany, the Ohio woman whose ex-boyfriend, a former Akron officer, pleaded guilty last year to stalking her. \"And when they use it for ill purposes to commit crimes against you \u2014 to stalk you, to follow you, to harass you ... it just becomes so dangerous.\" The misuse represents only a tiny fraction of the millions of daily database queries run legitimately during traffic stops, criminal investigations and routine police encounters. But the worst violations profoundly abuses systems that supply vital information on criminal suspects and law-abiding citizens alike. The unauthorized searches demonstrate how even old-fashioned policing tools are ripe for abuse, at a time when privacy concerns about law enforcement have focused mostly on more modern electronic technologies. And incomplete, inconsistent tracking of the problem frustrates efforts to document its pervasiveness. The AP tally, based on records requested from 50 states and about three dozen of the nation's largest police departments, is unquestionably an undercount. Some departments produced no records at all. Some states refused to disclose the information, said they don't comprehensively track misuse or produced records too incomplete or unclear to be counted. Florida reported hundreds of misuse cases of its driver database, but didn't say how often officers were disciplined. And some cases go undetected, officials say, because there aren't clear red flags to automatically distinguish questionable searches from legitimate ones. \"If we know the officers in a particular agency have made 10,000 queries in a month, we just have no way to (know) they were for an inappropriate reason unless there's some consequence where someone might complain to us,\" said Carol Gibbs, database administrator with the Illinois State Police. The AP's requests encompassed state and local databases and the FBI-administered National Crime and Information Center, a searchable clearinghouse that processes an average of 14 million daily transactions. The NCIC catalogs information that officers enter on sex offenders, immigration violators, suspected gang members, people with outstanding warrants and individuals reported missing, among others. Police use the system to locate fugitives, identify missing people and determine if a motorist they've stopped is driving a stolen car or is wanted elsewhere. Other statewide databases offer access to criminal histories and motor vehicle records, birth dates and photos. Officers are instructed that those systems, which together contain data far more substantial than an internet search would yield, may be used only for legitimate law enforcement purposes. They're warned that their searches are subject to being audited and that unauthorized access could cost them their jobs or result in criminal charges. Yet misuse persists. ____ 'SENSE OF BEING VULNERABLE' Violations frequently arise from romantic pursuits or domestic entanglements, including when a Denver officer became acquainted with a hospital employee during a sex-assault investigation, then searched out her phone number and called her at home. A Mancos, Colorado, marshal asked co-workers to run license plate checks for every white pickup truck they saw because his girlfriend was seeing a man who drove a white pickup, an investigative report shows. In Florida, a Polk County sheriff's deputy investigating a battery complaint ran driver's license information of a woman he met and then messaged her unsolicited through Facebook. Officers have sought information for purely personal purposes, including criminal records checks of co-workers at private businesses. A Phoenix officer ran searches on a neighbor during the course of a longstanding dispute. A North Olmsted, Ohio, officer pleaded guilty this year to searching for a female friend's landlord and showing up in the middle of the night to demand the return of money he said was owed her. The officer, Brian Bielozer, told the AP he legitimately sought the landlord's information as a safety precaution to determine if she had outstanding warrants or a weapons permit. But he promised as part of a plea agreement never to seek a job again in law enforcement. He said he entered the plea to avoid mounting legal fees. Some database misuse occurred in the course of other misbehavior, including a Phoenix officer who gave a woman involved in a drug and gun-trafficking investigation details about stolen cars in exchange for arranging sexual encounters for him. She told an undercover detective about a department source who could \"get any information on anybody,\" a disciplinary report says. Eric Paull, the Akron police sergeant who pleaded guilty last year to stalking Dekany, also ran searches on her mother, men she'd been close with and students from a course he taught, prosecutors said. A lawyer for Paull, who was sentenced to prison, said Paull has accepted responsibility for his actions. \"A lot of people have complicated personal lives and very strong passions,\" said Jay Stanley, an American Civil Liberties Union privacy expert. \"There's greed, there's lust, there's all the deadly sins. And often, accessing information is a way for people to act on those human emotions.\" Other police employees searched for family members, sometimes at relatives' requests, to check what information was stored or to see if they were the subjects of warrants. Still other searchers were simply curious, including a Miami-Dade officer who admitted checking dozens of officers and celebrities including basketball star LeBron James. Political motives occasionally surface. Deb Roschen, a former county commissioner in Minnesota, alleged in a 2013 lawsuit that law enforcement and government employees inappropriately ran repeated queries on her and other politicians over 10 years. The searches were in retaliation for questioning county spending and sheriff's programs, she contended. She filed an open-records request that revealed her husband and daughter were also researched, sometimes at odd hours. But an appeals court rejected her suit and several similar cases this month, saying the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the searches were unpermitted. \"Now there are people who do not like me that have all my private information ... any information that could be used against me. They could steal my identity, they could sell it to someone,\" Roschen said. \"The sense of being vulnerable,\" she added, \"there's no fix to that.\" ___ BETRAYAL OF TRUST Violations are committed by patrol officers, dispatchers, civilian employees, court personnel and high-ranking police officials. Some made dozens of improper searches. Some were under investigation for multiple infractions when they were punished, making it unclear whether database misuse was always the sole reason for discipline. Agencies uncover some violations during audits, or during investigations into other misconduct. Some emerge after a citizen, often the target of a search, finds out or grows suspicious. A Jacksonville, Florida, sheriff's officer was found to have run queries on his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend after she raised concerns she was being harassed, an internal affairs report says. The AP sought to focus on officers who improperly accessed information on others but also counted some cases in which officers divulged information to someone not authorized to receive it, or ran their own names for strictly personal purposes, including to check their car registrations. The tally also includes some cases in which little is known about the offense because some agencies provided no details \u2014 only that they resulted in discipline. The AP tried when possible to exclude benign violations, such as new employees who ran only their own names during training or system troubleshooting. But the variability in record-keeping made it impossible to weed out all such violations. Agencies in California, for instance, reported more than 75 suspensions, resignations and terminations between 2013 and 2015 arising from misuse of the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, state records show. But because the records didn't identify officers or specify the allegations, it's unclear whether multiple violations were committed by the same person or how egregious the infractions were. Colorado disclosed about 35 misuse violations without specifying punishment. Indiana listed 12 cases of abuse but revealed nothing about them. The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles reported about 400 violations in 2014 and 2015 of its Driver and Vehicle Information Database, or DAVID, but didn't include the allegations or punishment. The FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division offers training to state and local law enforcement agencies on NCIC use, and conducts audits every three years that include a sample of local departments, said spokesman Stephen Fischer. But it doesn't track how often NCIC information is misused. Violations, which are not required to be reported directly to the FBI, are inconsistently disclosed to the federal government. The FBI relies on local agencies to address violations that are identified, Fischer said. The AP requested records from large police departments and state agencies tasked with administering NCIC usage within their districts. The responses included cases where officers misused motor vehicle data, including driver's license and registration information, and also more sensitive criminal history records. Officers are only occasionally prosecuted, and rarely at the federal level. One recent exception is a former Cumming, Georgia, officer charged in June with accepting a bribe to search a woman's license plate number to see if she was an undercover officer. Another involved Ronald Buell, a retired New York Police Department sergeant who received probation for selling NCIC information to a private investigator for defense attorneys. At his July sentencing, Buell said he hoped other officers would learn \"to never put themselves in the position I'm in.\" It's unsettled whether improper database access is necessarily a federal crime and whether it violates a trespass statute that criminalizes using a computer for other than authorized purposes. A federal appeals court last year reversed the computer-crime conviction of ex-NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, whom tabloids dubbed the \"cannibal cop\" for his online exchanges about kidnapping and eating women and who improperly used a police database to gather information. Valle argued that as an officer, he was legally authorized to access the database. The court deemed the statute ambiguous and said it risked criminalizing a broad array of computer use. Misuse has occasionally prompted federal lawsuits under a statute meant to protect driver's license data. A Florida Highway Trooper, Donna Watts, accused dozens of officers of searching her in the state's driver database after she stopped a Miami-Dade officer for speeding in 2011. She alleged in lawsuits that she was harassed with prank calls, threatening posts on law enforcement websites and unfamiliar cars that idled near her home. Each unlawful access, she said in a court document, \"has either caused or worsened anxiety, depression, insomnia, and other medical/physical/psychological conditions I suffer.\" Law enforcement officials have taken steps to try to limit abuse, though they say they know of no foolproof safeguard given the volume of inquiries and the need for officers to have information at their fingertips. \"There's no system that could prohibit you from looking up your ex-wife's new boyfriend, because your ex-wife's new boyfriend could come in contact with the criminal justice system,\" said Peggy Bell, executive director of the Delaware Criminal Justice Information System. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety said it changed the way officers access a state driver database after a 2013 legislative audit found over half of the 11,000 law enforcement personnel who use it made searches that appeared questionable. The audit was conducted after a former state employee was charged with illegally viewing thousands of driver's license records. In Florida, a memorandum of understanding this year increased the amount of field audits law enforcement agencies must undergo regarding DAVID usage. Troopers in the Florida Highway Patrol sign usage warnings when they access the DAVID system and a criminal sanctions acknowledgment. Users are audited and instructed to select a reason for a search before making inquiries. Denver's independent monitor, Nicholas Mitchell, argued for strong policies and strict discipline as a safeguard, especially as increasing amounts of information are added to databases. His review found most of the 25 Denver officers punished for misusing databases over 10 years received at most reprimands. Miami-Dade police cracked down after the Watts scandal and other high-profile cases. The department now does quarterly audits in which officers can be randomly asked to explain searches. A sergeant's duties have been expanded to include daily reviews of proper usage and troubleshooting, said Maj. Christopher Carothers of the professional compliance bureau. Even if the public is unaware of the amount of available information, Carothers said, \"The idea that police would betray that trust out of curious entertainment or truly bad intent, that's very disturbing and unsettling.\" ____ Eric Tucker reported from Washington.

E-commerce retailers like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Google Shopping, and Overstock have joined in banning the images of the flag. Prior to banning products with the flag, Amazon's sales of the controversial symbol were skyrocketing. Even Apple removed games in the app stores with the flag. Governor Nikki Haley said it was \"time to from the [Confederate] flag from the Capitol grounds\" after the horrifying shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. She said the suspected Charleston shooter viewed the flag in a \"sick and twisted\" way. A controversy has stirred the nation over whether it is or isn't appropriate to sell the Confederate flag. People who support the flag say it is an important part of American history. But major retailers are worried about image, and making profits from the flags isn't worth the consequence of being perceived as racist, Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates Inc., a retail consulting agency and investment banking firm based in New York, told Business Insider \"This is no longer acceptable,\" Davidowitz said. \"And it went from being acceptable to no longer being acceptable pretty quick [so now] everybody is bailing out on it... no one wants to be seen as a racist or anything associated with racism.\" These retailers have to consider the people who would be offended. \"Their image is tremendously important to them, with their employees, with their shareholders, with their investors,\" Davidowitz said. \"There's no way they can be associated with this.\" \"Number one, [you'll be] turning off millions of customers if you sell [the Confederate flag], number two, [you'll be] turning off your own employees,\" Davidowitz said. This is particularly crucial for Wal-Mart. \"Most of their employees are part time employees \u2014 many of them are minorities,\" Davidowitz said, also mentioning that selling the flag \"will demotivate\" employees. \"If you're Wal-Mart, there is nothing more charged than race. That is more nuclear than any of [Wal-Mart's other] issues.\" However, Davidowitz highlighted that major retailer brands banning the flag will not put an end to sales of the flag in general. \"They're still going to be sold,\" he said. \"But they're going to be sold by independent stores across America who are going to do a tremendous amount of business selling the Confederate flag.\"", "Playing catch up to music rivals Spotify and Pandora, Google unveiled a free ad-supported version of its Play Music All Access streaming service Tuesday. Users will be able to listen to curated radio stations based on genre, mood, decade or activity. They can also search stations by artist, album or song to find stations that play similar music. Google's free music service comes two years after it introduced its paid version, which gives users access to more than 30 million songs for $10 per month. By creating free online radio stations, the tech giant is hoping to better compete against Spotify and Pandora, which have gained huge followings with their free music streaming services, and convert some free Google listeners into paying customers. Tuesday's premiere by Google coincides with recent tensions between streaming services and music artists. Over the weekend, Apple\u2019s upcoming paid streaming-music service faced withering criticism from pop singer Taylor Swift, who wrote a letter complaining about the company failing to pay artists royalties during a free three-month trial period. Apple quickly caved in. But it served as a big reminder about the tensions between the music streaming services and musicians, many of whom are angry about what they describe as low royalty rates. Google, with its new Internet radio, said it is paying the statutory rate to artists. As such, the company did not have to negotiate new deals with record labels. But Google is still vulnerable to some of the same challenges other streaming services over its payments to artists and record labels. On Google Music, Swift's previous records are available for streaming using the paid service but her most recent album, 1989, is only for sale. The album is not available on paid streaming nor will it be available on the free version. Spotify and Pandora\u2019s streaming services \u2014 both free and paid \u2014 have a big head start on Google. As competition heats up with Apple in the mix, Google will need a free service to pull in paid users. Google doesn\u2019t disclose subscriber numbers. But it did say that it has doubled the number of paid listeners in the last year. In comparison, Spotify recently revealed that it has 75 million users, 25 million of whom are paid subscribers. Google\u2019s free service will include two types of ads including a video pre-roll ad as well as banner ads. Marketers can buy ads as a part of the Google display and video networks. Some of the nuts and bolts behind Google's free streaming comes from Google acquisition last year of Songza, a music streaming service that used humans to curate playlists. Songza's team will help program the new streaming stations, in contrast to Pandora and Spotify, which are automated. Google says that with or without a subscription, users can continue store and play their own purchased music, which includes 50,000 songs, for free.", "To mark the 30th anniversary of her smash album, \"She's So Unusual,\" Cyndi Lauper revealed the surprise gay inspiration behind her then-controversial single, \"She Bop.\" At the time of its 1984 release, \"She Bop\" sparked the ire of parents of Lauper fans, given that the song is considered a thinly-veiled ode to masturbation (\"They say that a stitch in time saves nine/They say I better stop, or I'll go blind\"). For visual inspiration, Lauper sought out Blueboy magazine, which at the time, was a popular gay porn publication. \"There was Playgirl, but that was kinda boring,\" Lauper recalled. \"And there was, like, Blueboy, which at that time -- in my ignorance -- I thought it was a women's magazine. It was not.\" She then added, \"I tried to take real life and put it into the song.\"", "Since April, Facebook is suffering what they reportedly refer to as \u2018context collapse\u2019, with users sharing less personal information on the website.

Based on this information, data brokers can tailor ads to individuals in a much more accurate way - but the individual does not have access to the dossier about them. Steve Satterfield, a Facebook manager of privacy and public policy told ProPublica: Our approach to controls for third-party categories is somewhat different than our approach for Facebook-specific categories. This is because the data providers we work with generally make their categories available across many different ad platforms, not just on Facebook. Theoretically, contacting individual data brokers is the only way to prevent your information from being available to Facebook. There\u2019s even a page in Facebook\u2019s help centre listing a number of data brokers that sell personal data to the social media giant.  However, the reality is much more complex: many data brokers require a lengthy process to opt out \u2013 including providing identification. Even then, you\u2019re not guaranteed to be removed, and with almost 100 identified brokers (though there may well be more), your efforts could be exhaustive and, ultimately unsuccessful.  The best way to prevent your information from being sold to Facebook, is to limit the information you share. Alternatively, do not use Facebook.", "Ah, Art Attack. We all loved sitting in front of our televisions with cardboard, scissors and PVA glue, ready to make a masterpiece. However, we gave up two minutes in and proceeded to cover our hands in PVA, just so we could peel it off once it had dried - oh the nostalgia. Eventually, we grew out of Art Attack, as did the show's presenter, Neil Buchanan. Neil ended his 17-year stint with the show in 2007, leaving to focus on other things. Specifically, his music. It'll surprise you all to find out that he is part of the heavy metal band Marseille. The group formed in 1976, and reunited in 2008. He was a founding member in 1976, no less. The 55-year-old is the axe man of the group, and is just as handy with a guitar as he was with a paint brush. The band won the UK Battle Of The Bands, at Wembley, in 1977, and were the first British outfit to do so. Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen were the judges, so it was a pretty big thing.

According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before. In 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said \"I do.\" \"There's so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general,\" Gretchen Livingston, Senior Researcher at Pew and author of the study, told The Huffington Post. \"I was really curious to juxtapose that with what's going on with remarriage.\" Livingston analyzed data from the 2013 American Community Survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the US has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960. But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others. Among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry. There are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston. For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, \"eligible\" to remarry has also risen. (But it's worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since.) The more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers. While only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013. \"The older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried,\" Livingston said. Younger Americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013. It's very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasn't soured on the institution of marriage completely, however. Livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two. Overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again. Age wasn't the only differentiating factor, though. When Pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again. There was a clear gender divide: Divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position. A majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it. In comparison, 43 percent of women said they'd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn't want to ever marry again. Only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle. Previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do. Livingston said it's quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts. Another interesting finding combined both age and gender: In remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife. This age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples. If you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each other's ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy. But don't make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- it's a demographic that's still in flux. While today's divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesn't mean that today's society has lost faith in marriage. In fact, according to Pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960. Taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the American family. \"Maybe newlyweds don't look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late '60s,\" Livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of today's newlywed couples involve at least one person who's been married before. \"But I think it's very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing.\"", "Now this is a happy ending! \"Happy Endings' star Casey Wilson is engaged to the show's creator, David Caspe, Wilson confirmed to Us Weekly.

But almost all rely on a teaching tool that\u2019s barely changed in more than a century. To learn how to lead companies, MBA students read hundreds of case studies\u2014stripped-down narratives about a strategy problem at a real company\u2014and discuss how they would tackle the challenge. For Harvard Business School, which created and popularized the method\u2014 the school taught its first case in 1912\u2014case studies are a cottage industry as well as a bedrock of the curriculum. Harvard Business Publishing says it sells to about 4,000 schools globally; its cases account for 80 percent of the case studies used. HBP, which also publishes other business materials and the Harvard Business Review, had revenue of $194 million in 2014, according to the business school\u2019s annual report, a 44 percent increase from 2010. The publisher says it sold 12 million cases last year, to schools, companies, and others, and that and sales totaled about $30 million. Retail prices run from $9 to $15 for a basic case study; schools get discounts. \"The case method takes the learner through a reflective and analytic process that is very powerful,\" says Robert Bruner, dean of the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business. Some of Harvard\u2019s case studies seem hardly more sophisticated than Wikipedia entries, and that\u2019s deliberate, says Willis Emmons, director of Harvard\u2019s C. Roland Christensen Center for Teaching and Learning. \"Our cases are intentionally very limited in the amount of analysis they include,\" he says. \"The challenge for the student is to take both qualitative and quantitative information and make sense of that.\" HBP also sells teaching notes for business professors to facilitate class discussion of the cases. These include suggestions for specific words instructors should write on blackboards. At Harvard Business School, professors are given detailed profiles of their students, called class cards, that dictate the order and timing of whom they call on in a typical 80-minute class. \"The stronger and more experienced a faculty member is, the less visible it is how much work has gone into a session,\" says Emmons. The sheer scale of Harvard\u2019s publishing machine helps it maintain dominance in the case market. Darden Business Publishing calls itself the second-biggest publisher of cases in the U.S., but it sold fewer than 700,000 cases in 2014, according to Steve Momper, DBP\u2019s executive director. HBP produces and distributes co-branded case studies for about 40 business schools. These include the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, which launched a case series last year. Haas has no designs on challenging Harvard\u2019s market share; the school publishes cases to strengthen its brand and showcase the technology industry expertise of its Bay Area-based staff, says Richard Lyons, the dean. Case publishers often try to add variety to material that, well into the 1970s, featured subjects that were \"virtually always male and in settings that were quite prominently in the U.S.,\" says Darden\u2019s Bruner, who received an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1974. HBS is trying to reflect a more modern business landscape. In 2014, Nitin Nohria, dean of the business school, pledged to raise the share of women protagonists in Harvard cases to 20 percent. Cases increasingly incorporate video and Web-based elements, and a few find business lessons in unconventional sources, such as the case HBP published last year by Harvard professor Anita Elberse devoted to Beyonce\u0301\u2019s surprise 2013 album release. Of the 25 top business schools ranked by Bloomberg Businessweek last year, 19 reported that they use case studies as one of their main teaching tools. At HBS, 80 percent of class time is spent on case studies; at Darden, the figure is 75 percent. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Tepper School of Business uses case studies for about 30 percent of its instruction, according to Dean Robert Dammon. It considers them a supplement to management science, a teaching method developed at Tepper. \"The school was really founded to find an alternative approach to business education than the one that was being offered by schools like Harvard,\" says Dammon. \"In a case study, the relevant set of facts is laid out for you. Most business problems aren\u2019t presented to you in that way.\" The bottom line: The publishing arm of Harvard Business School sells case studies to about 4,000 business schools worldwide.

After being heralded as \"the creation of a near-perfect blue pigment,\" this coincidental eureka moment is now being manufactured for artists\u2019 brushes. This burst of blue came about when scientists at Oregon State University (OSU) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200\u00b0C (2,000\u00b0F). Although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named \"YInMn blue.\" The findings of the original study were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. \"Basically, this was an accidental discovery,\" said Mas Subramanian, a Milton Harris professor of materials science in the OSU Department of Chemistry, in a statement. \"Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment. He added: \"Then one day a graduate student who is working on the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while I was walking by, and it was blue, a very beautiful blue. I realized immediately that something amazing had happened.\" So, what\u2019s so special about this blue? This pigment is far more stable when exposed to heat or acidic conditions. Additionally, unlike Prussian blue or Cobalt blue pigments, it doesn\u2019t release cyanide and is not carcinogenic \u2013 that's always a plus. Not only that, the highly reflective properties of the new pigment means it could be used in paints that could help keep buildings cool by reflecting infrared light. Subramanian told Artnet in a recent interview that the pigment has become a popular choice among artists because of its vivid color and resistant properties. The paint manufacturers Shepherd Color Company have also licensed a patent and is now selling samples of YInMn blue. He added: \"Our pigment is useful for art restoration, because it is similar to ultramarine but really more durable.\" [H/T: Mental Floss]", "Filmmaking in 2013: \"Riddick,\" the third Vin Diesel film to feature that title anti-hero, is an indie feature. That means even Vin Diesel -- who, thanks to the \"Fast and Furious\" movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third \"Riddick\" movie. How did he get here? Let's start with \"The Chronicles of Riddick,\" the sequel to \"Pitch Black,\" which was released on June 11, 2004. The film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the North American box office, making it one of that summer's costly misfires. After that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, Universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film's reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million. Maybe, though, that was for the best. In this new installment, we find Riddick (Diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. After a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for Riddick. So, Riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as \"Riddick\" director David Twohy calls him, \"the bogey man.\" It's something Twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie. Did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" underperformed? Yeah, I had my doubts after the second one. And we suffered some slings and arrows. According to the studio, we spent way too much money and didn't make enough back. So, that's never a good formula. So, I had my doubts. If you speak with Vin, I'm thinking he would say, \"Never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie\" -- because that's just the kind of guy he is. He is a big dreamer. I'm more the pragmatist of the duo. Vin Diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years. Look, I've learned never to count Vin Diesel out. Just don't do that. And I guess it's because he is a very smart guy. Smarter than people give him credit for. I enjoyed that in \"Riddick\" the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw. These people basically just need to leave a planet and that's it. And look, I've been in those meetings, too. Where it's, \"We have to up the stakes. We have to give it a ticking clock\" ... So, I hope that \"Riddick,\" if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made. That's what I set out to do and Vin was certainly along for that ride, too. The first half hour, we're pretty much alone with Riddick. Then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and Riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him. That's right. Now, that's something the studio would have fret out about. \"Wait a second. You are totally sympathetic with Riddick while he's trying to survive, but then you're using him as the bogey man.\" Why did you want to do that? Because he is both those things. He is a man. He is a survivor -- a survivor with skills. And enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that he's a stone cold killer. But, you know I think it works. Because I have to introduce those new characters ... I have like 10 new characters to establish. And I can bolster Riddick's roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him. Do you think the success of the \"Fast and Furious\" movies helped to get \"Riddick\" made? Yes. But, here's the cyclical nature of the business. Because \"Pitch Black\" did well, that allowed him to be part of the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. And guess what? What goes around, comes around. So, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in \"The Fast and the Furious.\" And based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one. Even though Universal didn't want to make it at a certain point. In fact, they didn't make it. Do you know that story? I do not. It goes like this. After \"Chronicles,\" they said, \"We are out of the Riddick business. It's just a straight business calculation of us. You spent too much money and you didn't make enough back. So, no, we're not going to do anymore.\" Vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, \"Well, give me the rights back.\" And they didn't want to do that ... I think this was about the time that \"Fast 3\" had already shot and they were testing it. Maybe it wasn't testing as well as it should have and they decide, \"Maybe we need a cameo from Vin\" -- because he wasn't in that movie. So, I do believe that in his savviness, Vin said, \"Don't pay me for that cameo. Just give me the rights back.\" So, his company basically controls the rights and because I control all of the sequels and remakes. So, we can't make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. So, that's how he got the rights back and I think that was a great business move. So, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie. I wrote a spec script. We sold it in Berlin for international. We came back into town looking for a domestic partner. I thought it was going to be Sony or Film District -- they were both eager to have the movie. And then, guess what? Universal raises their hand, \"Well, what about us?\" And I said, \"This doesn't feel right to me\" But Vin, he was saying, \"That was then, this is now\" ... So with the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and his relationship with Universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at Universal. So, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the U.S. and Canada. So Universal didn't put any money into the film? They put money into it for their domestic distribution rights. So Riddick is an indie film? Here's an example of how it's an indie film. I wrote a spec script, we sold that. We went up to Montreal and I think I did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that. Then, when it comes to editing, I got to the point when I wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: What was clear to them and what was not clear to them. Because of things aren't clear to them, the audience can't enjoy it and I still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up. I didn't have it scored and didn't fill out forms, I just stood in front of them and asked them questions ... I had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point. So, very pure filmmaking. Very pure. Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment. You can contact him directly on Twitter.", "You've heard of street smarts and book smarts. But is your company sales smart? If you're like most organizations, the answer is probably not really. Sales teams face two perennial problems. No matter their industries or how large their companies, most lack a properly implemented training regimen and the resources to do their jobs efficiently. You can have insanely talented salespeople, and they'll still make the same mistakes over and over again if they don't have proper training. When people don't feel they're supported because they're constantly wanting for resources, they eventually burn out. But many companies fail to address these needs within their sales department, and they end up losing their top representatives because of it. Becoming Sales Intelligent Modern technology didn't create a training or resource crisis, but it did change the types of tools and training that social selling requires. Rapidly shifting sales techniques demand a proactive attitude toward salesforce development. Productivity tools have enabled salespeople to work smarter and spend more time interfacing with clients than managing mundane tasks. The flip side of this is that prospects and customers expect rapid results and constant access. Sales teams must be prepared for the 24/7 nature of their jobs. This is where sales intelligence comes in. Sales and marketing overlap more than ever before. Organizations that rely heavily on cold-calling for lead generation need to know whom to target and how to reach them with actionable messages. A few years ago, they would have used simple Google searches and corporate websites to piece together this information. Now, a multitude of services help businesses identify prospects, collect contact information, load the data into their CRMs, and schedule drip campaigns. In this sense, many sales reps are operating their own mini-marketing departments. Sales intelligence encompasses this entire data-gathering process. It includes all the contextual information you need about your sales contacts: purchase histories, industries, response rates, and other metrics that help you tailor your strategies to each target. The better you know your audience, the more effective your campaigns will be. That's Sales 101. But sales intelligence platforms enable you to put that concept to work by building more detailed profiles than were possible in the past. Still, the concept of sales intelligence is relatively new. Sales managers and executives are understandably wary of investing in tools and strategies if they're not clear on how the business will benefit. Sales intelligence tools improve efficiency and can increase conversions and profits. But they're effective only if you approach them correctly. Here's how to build sales intelligence within your company: 1. Emphasize productivity. The greatest virtue of sales intelligence tools is that they save so much time. You most likely hired your reps on the basis of their sales acumen, not their stellar research skills. Rather than having them spend hours scouring the internet for details about prospects, intelligence tools get them to the right people and companies faster. Cultivate a passion for productivity among your sales teammates. They'll be thrilled to try out new platforms that provide them with more time to do what they do best: sell. 2. Evaluate potential ROI. The big questions with new tools are always: How much will this cost? And what's the ROI? Analyze the amount of time and resources that can be saved using different platforms. Then, compare that with the cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining the new systems. That will tell you whether sales intelligence is worth the investment. Usually, the answer is yes. 3. Investigate key features. Sales managers often tell me they're reluctant to adopt sales intelligence platforms because the tools aren't intuitive. They may have watched a demo video or presentation and come away feeling more confused than they were to begin with. If you've experienced this, know that the fault probably lies more with the sales rep who led the demo than with the product itself. Have patience and seek out the features that are relevant to your organization. Sales intelligence is critical to your company's growth. What obstacles are preventing you from embracing these tools, and what would inspire more confidence in them?", "July 8th 2016 2 Shares Credit: PA Have you ever stopped to wonder why all statues in art galleries and museums have small dicks? I can honestly say it's not something I've ever thought about, but I do remember them being smaller than average; I just assumed it was cold when they had to pose. If this sort of stuff keeps you awake at night, then you'll be pleased to know that the people at How to Talk About Art History have answered the all-important question. And the reason is because big penises were nothing to be proud of back in ancient Greece and Rome. Credit: PA Big ones meant the owner was 'foolish, lustful and ugly' (bet he could still get fit girls, though) and small ones meant you were a bit smarter and more rational. I think we can safely say it was a lad with a tiny one who started that rumour. They also think that the sculptor probably spent more time carving the face, hair and muscles, so he didn't spend too long on the penis. And who can blame him there? Imagine if your entire day at work was spent making a dick out of marble? My favourite thing about all this is that it bothered someone enough to make them ask a serious art historian. The internet is a wonderful place. And remember, if you've got a little knob, in future, just tell girls it's actually a sign that you're more rational and intellectual. Words Claire Reid", "The protagonist of \"Malibu,\" the third short story in Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s new collection, spends his time making up job applications so he can continue to receive unemployment benefits and try to coax money out of his aging uncle, who has a colostomy bag and does little but eat fatty meals in front of daytime TV. He\u2019s handsome but pimply and given to throwing up after eating; he daydreams of the beautiful woman he\u2019ll one day fall in love with, but treats the real women he meets like inconveniently sentient Kleenex. Oh, and then there are his hands. \"As good-looking as I was, I was scared nobody would ever marry me,\" he admits. \"I had small hands. They were like a girl\u2019s hands, but with hair. Nobody marries men with hands like that.\" When he goes to a meet-up he\u2019s planned with a strange woman, he shoves his hand down her throat, enjoying that he can see how his intrusive hand bulges her neck. He recalls taking a prostitute to a motel room: \"I sat down next to her and splayed my hands out on the bed. \u2018What do you think about these?\u2019 I asked. Nobody ever gave me the answer I wanted. Nobody ever said, \u2018Oh, so beautiful!\u2019\" Moshfegh\u2019s fiction is nothing if not distinctive. As in her debut novel, Eileen, the narrators of the 14 stories in Homesick for Another World are gloomy, narcissistic and self-pitying. Their lives are claustrophobic and squalid. They\u2019re constantly squeezing their acne, having sex with people they despise, eating candy and drinking until they\u2019re sick, developing meth addictions just for kicks, and always feeling slightly superior to their own surroundings despite their listless lives. They crave adoration, but look on anyone who gives it to them with contempt. In one story, a man obsesses over a woman who works at a video game arcade he frequents. He finally manages to secretly court her via text, but quickly loses his interest in her once she seems attainable: \"He took out his phone and reread all her texts again. \u2018I am very lonely and troubled. Who are you?\u2019 She sounded desperate, he thought. He had made a grievous mistake, he thought.\" In a story called \"The Beach Boy,\" a man\u2019s wife dies suddenly after their 29th anniversary celebration on a tropical island. Initially devastated and adrift, he then catches sight of an unfamiliar face in the photos he developed from the trip. Though it\u2019s out of focus and context-free, he\u2019s convinced that it was a picture taken by his late wife \u2015 of a male prostitute from the island. Suddenly, he\u2019s revolted by her, the woman he thought was a lady, but who he\u2019s now certain was unfaithful. \"Marcia was gone for good now,\" Moshfegh writes after her ashes were disposed of, \"and he felt like celebrating.\" The women in Homesick for Another World are equally self-involved and dismissive of their romantic partners. In one story, a woman lives with her boyfriend, who manages a dingy apartment complex while pursuing his dream of acting. She quietly loathes him, the way he clenches his muscles constantly to stay in shape, his devotion to a crystal skull he keeps by his bed, the yellow women\u2019s blazer he bought secondhand and considers the height of manly fashion. He develops a meth addiction. She never really tries to leave. In another story, a high school English teacher spends her summers in a dying small town, subsisting on subs and drugs. She has a brief fling with a local: \"I still remember the humility it took for me to agree to take him home.\" She hires a heavily pregnant young woman to clean her home, then calmly ignores it when her housekeeper begins to hemorrhage on the job. The unpleasant, even grotesque behaviors of her characters seem amplified thanks to Moshfegh\u2019s cool, matter-of-fact prose. In either first-person or close third-person narration, the blunt, unemotional words with which her characters relate their petty cruelties, addictions, and even bodily functions never ceases to be slightly jarring. In much fiction, writers draw us in by painting the relatable, lovable vulnerabilities within even their most nominally unsympathetic characters, complicating our impulse to divide the world into \"good\" and \"bad.\" Moshfegh\u2019s stories do the reverse, confronting readers with the squicky, selfish, and sociopathic inner selves of even outwardly decent people.  Reading Homesick for Another World offers a similar experience to watching a dark comedy, like the British sitcom \"Peep Show.\" There\u2019s something refreshing and funny about her unvarnished portrayal of human squalor, but also something unsettling and difficult to swallow. It\u2019s not a book to reassure readers of the essential goodness of the human race; it\u2019s a queasy jolt to our optimistic selves, a reminder of the lowest, most id-driven proclivities of humanity. This may sound unappealing, yet Moshfegh\u2019s talent is a sheer delight \u2015 and the heedless misbehavior of her characters is a reminder, needed now more than ever, that we\u2019re not such an elevated species as we\u2019d like to think, and that following our base impulses can lead us nowhere fast.  The Bottom Line: Moshfegh\u2019s stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature, which is easy but self-deluding to ignore. What other reviewers think: The New York Times: \"If there\u2019s a thematic thread weaving through this collection, it\u2019s the complicated relationship between entrapment in the physical body \u2014 her characters are often probing, picking and searching with their fingertips, as if seeking beauty and potential grace \u2014 and entrapment in social landscapes.\" NPR: \"There\u2019s not a story in Homesick for Another World that\u2019s anything less than original and perfectly constructed. Moshfegh\u2019s talent is unique, and her characters \u2014 unfiltered, cold, frequently pathetic \u2014 are all the more memorable for their faults and obliviousness.\" Who wrote it? Ottessa Moshfegh has previously published a novel, Eileen, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and was given the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award. After her book, a noir novel about a miserable and self-loathing young woman who works in a detention center, was nominated for the Man Booker Prize, she notoriously confessed to The Guardian that she\u2019d written the book as a joke to get attention. She has published her short fiction in The Paris Review and The New Yorker, among other outlets. Who will read it? Fans of shocking, provocative fiction starring intensely disagreeable characters \u2015 and readers who don\u2019t mind being grossed out. Opening lines: \"My classroom was on the first floor, next to the nuns\u2019 lounge. I used their bathroom to puke in the mornings. One nun always dusted the toilet seat with talcum powder. Another nun plugged the sink and filled it with water. I never understood the nuns. One was old and one was young. The young one talked to me sometimes, asked me what I would do for the long weekend, if I\u2019d see my folks over Christmas, and so forth. The old one looked the other way and twisted her robes in her fists when she saw me coming.\" Notable passage: \"Her pretty, gleaming calves appeared between the rungs of the banister as she came down the steps. She\u2019d folded the cuffs of her leggings up above her knees, which were red from kneeling on the floor. When her thighs appeared, I saw a black stain of blood at her crotch. She seemed not to know that she was bleeding. There was no way she could have seen the blood past the mountain of her belly, I suppose. She gripped the bucket with one hand and the railing with the other as she descended the stairs. \"\u2019Oh, shit,\u2019 she said when she reached the landing. \u2018I forgot the broom.\u2019\" Homesick for Another World By Ottessa Moshfegh Penguin Press, $26.00 Published January 3, 2017 The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book.", "Wikipedia A new study has provided an updated theory about how the dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago. A paper published in the Scientific Reports journal puts forward the theory that a massive asteroid did indeed strike the Earth, but that its devastating effects were different than commonly thought, reports The Independent. Researchers \u2013 from Japan\u2019s Meteorological Research Institute and Tohuku Univeristy \u2013 now believe the asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, hitting massive oil deposits and sending a blanket of thick black smoke into the atmosphere, engulfing the planet. The amount of sunlight fell by a huge 85 per cent, causing the Earth to cool by as much as 16 degrees Celsius on land for about three years. Also, rainfall would have fallen by roughly 80 per cent causing extreme and devastating droughts. The researchers wrote: Small mammals and reptiles could have lived underground where it is warmer \u2013 dinosaurs did not. These different habitats would have been key factors in determining their extinction or survival. Wikimedia Experts had previously wondered why dinosaurs had died out while other reptiles \u2013 like the ancestors of crocodiles \u2013 had survived. The accepted theory was that the impact caused vapours of sulphuric acid in the sky, which reflected sunlight, leading to global darkness, near-freezing conditions and widespread acid rain. However, the team from Tohuku said: If this had occurred, crocodilians and various other animals would have also gone extinct. It is thought that only 12 per cent of life on land lived through the aftermath of the asteroid impact, whereas 90 per cent of freshwater species managed to survive. Dark times.

Try soaking fresh berries in vinegar and water. This will slow down the molding process and keep from from getting mushy! 1. Put the berries into a bowl, then add your vinegar and water (1 parts vinegar to 10 parts water). 2. Mix thoroughly, then drain the berries and let them dry completely. 3. Store in the fridge 3. Try adding an apple to your potatoes. This will keep the potatoes from sprouting! Storing potatoes with an apple is supposed to keep them from growing those unseemly sprouts! However, keep apples away from every other type of produce. They produce a gas that will accelerate the ripening process for most other types of produce. 4. Wrap cheese in a vinegar-soaked cheesecloth to prevent it from molding! 1. Sprinkle a cheesecloth (or a thin washcloth made of natural fibers) with vinegar. 2. Wrap the cheese, and then place it in an airtight container in the fridge to keep it from molding for longer! 5. Hang your onions in pantyhose to keep them at their maximum freshness! 1. Place the onion in a clean pair of pantyhose, and tie a knot above the onion. You can stack more onions, separating each with a knot. 2. Hang in a cool, dry, dark place. When they are dry, separated, able to breathe, and suspended they should have a maximized shelf life. 3. When you need an onion, you just cut one off. 6. Freezing leftover herbs in olive oil will make for flavorful cooking down the line! 1. You can preserve herbs by freezing them in olive oil (use a freezer tray and fill them with herbs/olive oil). 2. When using them to cook, take out a cube of the herb-infused oil and let it serve as the base for cooking your dish. NOTE: This works best for harder herbs like rosemary, sage, thyme, and oregano (softer herbs such as mint, basil, lemon verbena, and dill should not be preserved in this manner).", "The new Chuck Taylors are here. The first new design in 98 years. I\u2019m wearing them right now. These absurdly, blindingly white objects are shoes. More precisely, they\u2019re the much-hyped Converse Chuck IIs, which were released on Tuesday. By the end of that first day on sale, these lowtops were the last pair of size 11 shoes left at the company\u2019s Manhattan flagship store. I snagged \u2018em. The store had seen a rush on the newly redesigned shoes that day. The sales associate just shook his head when I handed him the popular standard-issue black hightop model. \"Try online,\" he suggested. I told him I would take any pair of the coveted new All Stars that they had in my size. Usually when there is a rush for shoes, it\u2019s caused by a bunch of sneaker nerds lining up to get some special edition. In this case, it was more like people lining up for iPhones. This shoe will be mass-produced. There will be more next week, and the week after that, and assuming people keep buying them, there will be Chuck IIs for a hundred years, which is about how long ago the originals were released. The Converse flagship store in SoHo, New York was almost completely sold out of Chuck IIs in my size on the day the sneakers were released. But I think I understand why there was a rush on the new Chucks, even by unfashionable schlubs like me. Besides Jordans, it\u2019s hard to imagine a shoe more iconic and beloved than the Chuck Taylor. I remember when I finally convinced my dad to let me get a pair in middle school, even over his objections that they were shit shoes that were going to fuck up my feet. I\u2019ve gone through a pair or two per year ever since. I never found the shoes as painfully uncomfortable as some people, but their hundred-year-old design isn\u2019t especially ergonomic. People are psyched about the new Chuck II because it retains much of the classic Converse look\u2014I actually think they\u2019re kind of hotter now\u2014while introducing new design features that make them legitimately comfortable. The new Chuck II on the left, the old-school Chuck Taylor on the right. You can see many of the aesthetic changes in the sweet comparison video shot by my colleague Michael Hession. Converse sent us black hightops, but they were a size 9 which is unfortunately way, way too small for me. How do they feel on the foot? After spending a day in my new bright shining kicks, I can tell you for sure, they\u2019re more comfortable. They feel like real shoes now, instead of like shoddy canvas sacks for feet. At the core of the design is a new foamy insole made of Lunarlon, a springy foam material designed by Coverse\u2019s parent, Nike. Don\u2019t let the marketing term fool you though, this is just a comfy insole. It feels much like one you would buy to put into your running shoes. In this case it\u2019s nice to have it specially shaped and designed for the shoe itself. Besides the insole, the biggest change is the no-slip tongue, which indeed does not slip. It\u2019s a huge change for the Chuck Taylor. The old tongue that wiggles its way to the side over time is so common that it\u2019s central to the Chuck Taylor aesthetic. There are some aspects of the sneaker\u2019s redesign that we\u2019ll have to wait and see on. The Chuck IIs use some tougher-looking (and feeling) rubber construction of the rubber sole as well as the rubber that binds the sole to the rest of the shoe. This tends to be where the old-school chucks fall apart over time. Sponsored Additionally, the new chucks use a tougher canvas, which makes the overall shoe feel sturdy like it\u2019s got real structure that supports your ankles, rather than serving as just a flimsy coat that\u2019s draped over your feet. Will the new Chuck be more durable, or suffer the same fate of its flimsy predecessor? Is it even a Chuck Taylor if it doesn\u2019t turn to shit over time? A pair of hightop Chuck IIs cost $75, compared to $55 for the old-school All Star. It\u2019s worth it.", "A study last year found that eating fewer calories slowed down the effects of aging in mice, and now it\u2019s looking like those same results can be mimicked through the application of a very common ingredient in face creams, allantoin. A recent study in the U.K. found that the agent, extracted from the comfrey plant, can extend the life of certain worms by 20%. While that\u2019s a far cry from extending the lives of humans, it\u2019s an interesting development, and one that certainly gives credence to the claims that face creams are \"anti-aging.\" Here\u2019s a video that discusses the other effects of allantoin, drawn from the comfrey plant: The discovery was made when a team from the University of Liverpool, using data from the Connectivity Map, leveraged pattern-matching algorithms to determine what molecules might have the same effect on humans as a calorie-restricted diet. The team found 11 potential matches, and after testing five of them on nematode worms, found a link between allantoin and increased longevity. The results of this finding can be used both specifically as the direct effects of allantoin are studied, and generally, as team member Shaun Clavert explains, \"\"The next step for us is to understand the mechanisms by which allantoin extends lifespan, as this could reveal new longevity pathways.\" While caloric reduction has been proven again and again to increase life span in all organisms, it\u2019s simply not feasible to expect humans to decrease their food intake by 60% without substantial drops in quality of life, so any other avenues that can provide similar results are sure to draw interest.", "You and 3.2M others like this.

So, we put together a few super quick hacks that will help you So, we put together a few super quick hacks that will help you improve your Netflix streaming. The first step is to check what streaming quality you\u2019re currently using. That means signing into Netflix on your browser, going into \"Your Account\" and double-checking that the high-quality option is checked (obviously). But let\u2019s talk about browsers for a second. Did you ever think your browser could be causing your streaming issues? No, I\u2019m not talking about your internet connection or the fact that there are so many other people using Netflix at the same time as you. See, if you\u2019re streaming on Firefox, Chrome or Opera, your streaming speed is See, if you\u2019re streaming on Firefox, Chrome or Opera, your streaming speed is capped at 720p That\u2019s not as good as what you can get if you use Internet Explorer (yes, really), Safari or Microsoft Edge, which gets you to 1080p for some nice high-definition streaming. Give yourself the streaming quality you deserve, people. But wait, there\u2019s more! You can also use You can also use a little trick to avoid having to wait for something on Netflix to buffer, but only if you\u2019re watching on a computer. While watching a movie or TV show, press Shift+Opt or Shift+Alt (for Windows) and left click to reveal the evasive Stream Manager menu. The options on this menu can help fix buffering. On Chrome specifically, hold down Ctrl+Shift+Alt or Opt+S (for Mac) for the menu. You\u2019re going to thank me for this.

After the Leave vote, some speculated that they could renew their passport immediately and remain a citizen of the EU for the next 10 years. That option will not work. Even though the cover of a British passport reads \"European Union\" at the top, when the UK leaves Europe, it ceases to be an EU passport. Accordingly, many people will decide it is rational to seek an alternative passport. But how difficult is it? The easiest route for some will be to acquire Irish citizenship through descent - a process that is straightforward if you have the good fortune to have an Irish parent. It doesn't matter if they were born in the Republic or Northern Ireland; it's the island of Ireland that counts. The government in Dublin says: \"If either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen, irrespective of your place of birth. If you were born outside Ireland to an Irish citizen who was himself or herself born outside Ireland, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen.\" David Cameron resigns as PM Even if neither of your parents is an Irish citizen, you can go back another generation: to citizenship through descent from Irish grandparents. The Irish government says if one of your grandparents is an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, you can have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register - and, \"If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration.\" This lineage can continue through the generations: if you are (or become) an Irish citizen, this status can be passed on \"by each generation ensuring their registration in the Foreign Births Register before the birth of the next generation\". 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you 6 show all 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you 1/6 More expensive foreign holidays The first practical effect of a vote to Leave is that the pound will be worth less abroad, meaning foreign holidays will cost us more nito100 2/6 No immediate change in immigration status The Prime Minister will have to address other immediate concerns. He is likely to reassure nationals of other EU countries living in the UK that their status is unchanged. That is what the Leave campaign has said, so, even after the Brexit negotiations are complete, those who are already in the UK would be allowed to stay Getty 3/6 Higher inflation A lower pound means that imports would become more expensive. This is likely to mean the return of inflation \u2013 a phenomenon with which many of us are unfamiliar because prices have been stable for so long, rising at no more than about 2 per cent a year. The effect may probably not be particularly noticeable in the first few months. At first price rises would be confined to imported goods \u2013 food and clothes being the most obvious \u2013 but inflation has a tendency to spread and to gain its own momentum AFP/Getty Images 4/6 Interest rates might rise The trouble with inflation is that the Bank of England has a legal obligation to keep it as close to 2 per cent a year as possible. If a fall in the pound threatens to push prices up faster than this, the Bank will raise interest rates. This acts against inflation in three ways. First, it makes the pound more attractive, because deposits in pounds will earn higher interest. Second, it reduces demand by putting up the cost of borrowing, and especially by taking larger mortgage payments out of the economy. Third, it makes it more expensive for businesses to borrow to expand output Getty 5/6 Did somebody say recession? Mr Carney, the Treasury and a range of international economists have warned about this. Many Leave voters appear not to have believed them, or to think that they are exaggerating small, long-term effects. But there is no doubt that the Leave vote is a negative shock to the economy. This is because it changes expectations about the economy\u2019s future performance. Even though Britain is not actually be leaving the EU for at least two years, companies and investors will start to move money out of Britain, or to scale back plans for expansion, because they are less confident about what would happen after 2018 AFP/Getty Images 6/6 And we wouldn\u2019t even get our money back All this will be happening while the Prime Minister, whoever he or she is, is negotiating the terms of our future access to the EU single market. In the meantime, our trade with the EU would be unaffected, except that companies elsewhere in the EU may be less interested in buying from us or selling to us, expecting tariff barriers to go up in two years\u2019 time. Whoever the Chancellor is, he or she may feel the need to bring in a new Budget Getty Images If your genes are geopolitically unhelpful, the next possible route to an EU passport is marriage. But don\u2019t expect instant results. Each country makes its own rules on how long it takes to acquire citizenship, and they are generally designed to avoid marriages of convenience. For example, the spouse of a citizen of Malta can become a citizen of the island only after five years of wedded bliss. The final option is open only to those with the right kind of bank balance: buying your way in to EU nationality, with a \"citizenship by investment\" scheme that many countries offer. According to KPMG, Cyprus is \"the \u2018jurisdiction of choice\u2019 for many high net worth individuals and their families\".

Not bad, right?", "Lenders were handing out Lenders were handing out mortgages seemingly to anyone who applied, and in many cases, borrowers weren't asked for documentation to prove income. Some institutions rolled out adjustable-rate mortgages that featured teaser rates and were marketed to consumers as loans that could be easily refinanced before the interest rate was scheduled to reset and send payments into the stratosphere. As buyers clamored for homes, prices surged. But then the economy slowed and the bottom fell out of the housing market. Homeowners were unable to make payments, and sagging values made refinancing or selling impossible. The market crashed in what is widely considered one of the worst recessions to hit the country. While the economy and While the economy and home prices have both rebounded , some people have expressed concern we are headed for a repeat housing bubble. As of January 2016, home prices were rising at a rate twice that of inflation, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. What's more, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have unveiled programs to allow first-time homebuyers to make a purchase with only 3 percent down. Plus, some lenders are using alternate credit scores, which may make loans available to those who can't get one under conventional credit scoring methods.

The swallow-hard price tag: $27.5 million. Aside from the \"Bob Hope slept here\" factor, the price is, in part, justified because of the 5.15 acres of land that the compound sits on; it's a rare bit of tranquility in the shadow of urban development that includes close proximity to Universal Studios. The eight-bedroom main house is 14,876 square feet and there is a two-bedroom guesthouse as well as a two-bedroom maids' quarters and offices. The home was designed by Robert Finkelhor and remodeled by John Elgin Woolf in the mid-1950s. The property has both indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and a Bob Hope special: a one-hole golf course. President Richard Nixon once landed his helicopter on Hope's back lawn so that the president could play a few golfing rounds at the nearby Lakeside Golf Club, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Max was like, 'It's funny \u2014 just do it!' I know it's funny and silly, but grammatically incorrect things make me cringe sometimes.\" And so Ariana Grande attempts to defend the infamous \"Now that I become who I really are\" lyric from her current hit \"Break Free,\" with the \"Max\" in question being pop ingenieur (and \"Break Free\" co-writer) Max Martin. The quote comes from a story on the song from Time.com, whose title proclaims \"Ariana Grande Is Fully Aware That the Lyrics of 'Break Free' Make No Sense,\" with Grande appearing sheepishly contrite for bending the laws of the English language to force a rhyme with the song's previous line, \"Never by the hands of a broken heart.\" She needn't have done so. A cursory glance over the history of pop music reveals dozens of similarly forced rhymes littering the lyrics of some of our greatest hits, misses and deep cuts. They tend to fall into one of five categories -- Awkward Syntax, Jarring Word Choice, Non-Sequitorial Thought Process, English Subversion or Not Quite a Rhyme in the First Place -- and the most ambitious of them can sometimes satisfy two categories at once. While these forced rhymes may be unpleasant to the ear and/or the stomach upon first listen, many of them come to be as endearing as any of the song's more conventionally poetic (or merely intelligible) lyrics. (Others remain permanently nauseating, but still.) Anyway, here are the 20 most incredibly forced rhymes to ever come out of radio speakers and strike daggers through the hearts of unassuming Language Arts teachers nationwide. Ariana Grande can look left or look right on this list and see that there's no shame in spurning didactic grammar bylaws every now and then in the name of pop immortality. 20. \"What can I do? / Honey, I feel like the color blue\" (Aerosmith's \"Crazy,\" 1993) Rhyme Crime: Awkward Syntax Really, the crime here is just \"taking too many words to get to the rhyme in question.\" \"What can I do? / I'm feeling blue\" is a classic two-fer, feeling \"like the color blue\" sounds a little too literal to be evocative. 19. \"Let me see them big titties / Don't act saddity you ain't pretty\" (Timbaland's \"Bounce,\" 2007) Rhyme Crime: English Subversion (with a touch of Non-Sequitorial Thought Process) \"Saddity\" isn't a word, and telling a girl she \"ain't pretty\" after demanding to see her \"big titties\" isn't a thing. 18. \"I am, I said, to no one there / And no one heard it all, not even the chair\" (Neil Diamond's \"I Am, I Said,\" 1971) Rhyme Crime: Non-Sequitorial Thought Process This one actually inspired Dave Barry to write his infamous Book of Bad Songs, with Barry theorizing Diamond landed on the \"chair\" lyric after rejecting \"So I ate a pear,\" \"Like Smokey The Bear,\" and \"There were nits in my hair.\" 17. \"Moving like a tortoise / Full of rigor mortis\" (N.W.A.'s \"Express Yourself,\" 1988) Rhyme Crime: Awkward Syntax / Jarring Word Choice Tortoises may indeed move like creatures struck by rigor mortis (although if something's really full of rigor mortis, it shouldn't be moving at all), but saying anything is \"full of rigor mortis\" is kind of like saying something is \"full of deathness,\" which is kind of weird. 16. \"So happy together / And how is the weather?\" (The Turtles' \"Happy Together,\" 1967) Rhyme Crime: Non-Sequitorial Thought Process \"And how is the weather?\" is rhyming proof you can only sing the title phrase over again so many times in a song's outro before clinging onto any other potentially rhyming phrase to save you from the monotony. 15. \"I don't like cities, but I like New York / Other places make me feel like a dork\" (Madonna's \"I Love New York,\" 2006) Rhyme Crime: Jarring Word Choice Somehow, we doubt Madonna is really dorking it up on her visits to Paris and Milan. We'd need to see the acne and the social awkwardness for proof, anyway. 14. \"Don't fix your lips like collagen / And say something when you gon' end up apologin'\" (Kanye West's \"Can't Tell Me Nothin',\" 2006) Rhyme Crime: English Subversion Kanye assumes carte blanche to invent a new word whenever he really needs a rhyming end-of-phrase, and as with so many other artistic permissions, we tend to grant it to him. 13. \"I'm used to good ol' fashioned homestyle Spanish cooking / If I eat that, I'll be puking\" (Gerardo's \"Rico Suave,\" 1991) Rhyme Crime: Not Quite a Rhyme in the First Place The list of lyrical atrocities perpetrated by \"Rico Suave\" is not a short one, but attempting to rhyme \"cooking\" with \"puking\" is certainly near the top. Also, gross. 12. \"So open up your morning light / Say a little prayer for I\" (Paula Cole's \"I Don't Want to Wait,\" 1997) Rhyme Crime: Jarring Word Choice A kind of spiritual predecessor to \"Break Free,\" Paula thought enough of her song's opening line to switch the appropriate \"me\" with \"I\" in the second line to open up the rhyming possibilities. Eh. 11. \"You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute / I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot\" (Rick Springfield's \"Jessie's Girl,\" 1981) Rhyme Crime: Awkward Syntax It's a strange trip to get there, but certainly no one has ever deployed the word \"moot\" with as much pathos as Rick Springfield in this No. 1 hit. 10. \"We gonna pin this triple murder on him / He ain't no Gentleman Jim\" (Bob Dylan's \"Hurricane,\" 1976) Rhyme Crime: Awkward Syntax / Jarring Word Choice One of Dylan's best and biggest hits of the '70s, \"Hurricane\" might have simply had too many lyrics for a couple of them not to end up a little awkward -- none more than this considerable stretch for plausible criminal dialogue. 9. \"The wild dogs cry out in the night, as they grow restless longing for some solitary company / I know that I must do what's right, as sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti\" (Toto's \"Africa,\" 1982) Rhyme Crime: Jarring Word Choice / Non-Sequitorial Thought Process Not terribly logical or fluid as a pop lyric, but great as part of a middle school geography lesson plan, perhaps. 8. \"Mike my stromy, don't be so selfish / Just get on the mic, 'coz you know you eat shellfish\" (Beastie Boys' \"B-Boy Bouillabaisse,\" 1989) Rhyme Crime: Non-Sequitorial Thought Process Hard to argue the Beasties didn't know what they were doing here, but rhyming \"selfish\" with \"shellfish\" is just way too beautifully forced to possibly ignore. 7. \"I laughed at all of your jokes / My love you didn't need to coax\" (Rod Stewart's \"Maggie May,\" 1971) Rhyme Crime: Awkward Syntax Are there really so few words out there that rhyme with \"jokes\" that you needed to flip around an already weird-sounding phrase just to shoehorn \"coax\" in there, Rod? Yikes if so. 6. \"Papa said to Mama as he passed around the black-eyed peas / 'Well, Billie Joe never had a lick o' sense, pass the biscuits, please'\" (Bobbie Gentry's \"Ode to Billie Joe,\" 1967) Rhyme Crime: Non-Sequitorial Thought Process Maybe if everyone in this song wasn't so easily distracted by passing food around the dinner table, we would have figured out what Billie Joe McAllister was throwing off that damn Tallahatchie bridge by now. 5. \"When you take a sip you buzz like a hornet / Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets\" (LFO's \"Summer Girls,\" 1999) Rhyme Crime: Not Quite a Rhyme in the First Place / Non-Sequitorial Thought Process At least one out of every two couplets from \"Summer Girls\" could have qualified for this list, which might explain why it was so popular for the first place. Nothing says \"SUMMER WOOOO!!\" like improper grammar and a short attention span. 4. \"I only wanna die alive, never by the hands of a broken heart / Don't wanna hear you lie tonight, now that I've become who I really are\" (Ariana Grande's \"Break Free,\" 2014) Rhyme Crime: Jarring Word Choice / English Subversion Embrace it, young Ariana. 3. \"He starts to shake, he starts to cough / Just like the old man in that famous book by Nabokov\" (The Police's \"Don't Stand So Close to Me,\" 1980) Rhyme Crime: Jarring Word Choice / Awkward Syntax It may be an accurate character description for Humbert Humbert over the course of Lolita, but calling him the \"old man in that famous book by Nabokov\" isn't exactly the most efficient way to namecheck him. Also: not how you pronounced Nabokov, Sting. 2. \"Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas / You know he knows exactly what the facts is\" (Steve Miller Band's\"Take the Money and Run,\" 1976) Rhyme Crime: Not Quite a Rhyme / Awkward Syntax / English Subversion Well-timed handclaps and an awesome drum intro distract from a lot of eye-widening lyrics in this song, none more so than this dandy that packs improper English, bad rhyming and ridiculous storytelling into one 17-word couplet. 1. \"Her lips are devil red, and her skin's the color mocha / She will wear you out, livin' la vida loca\" (Ricky Martin's \"Livin' La Vida Loca,\" 1999)", "For the past week, I've been testing out a VW Beetle \"Dune,\" a special edition of the iconic reboot of the legendary \"people's car.\" The car is loads of fun, has an amazing audio system, and is pretty cheap, at less than $25,000. But it also has a nifty feature that no driver is ever going to see \u2014 although he or she might hear it, and it solves a problem that every driver with a backup camera has faced when the weather gets rough. Check it out. It's an adorable little gold VW Beetle \"Dune.\" You start it up and put it in reverse and ... ... the backing camera activates and you can see behind you on the infotainment screen. Here's the back of the car. But where is the camera? Don't see one anywhere, just that famous VW badge ... ... which flips open when the car is in reverse to reveal the hidden camera! Can you spot it? There it is. Quite cool, but something the driver never sees, as the badge closes when the car isn't in reverse. You can hear it opening, however, from the driver's seat. And because the camera is almost always covered, it stays clean. Backup cameras have become ubiquitous on new cars, but they're often dirty. VW has fixed that problem!", "This guy has apparently died three times this year, most recently in Turkey. (Image: @sidaxmejicano/Twitter) If this face seems familiar, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019ve seen it associated with any number of recent terror incidents. This man has apparently died at least three times since January, most recently in the terrorist attack at Atatu\u0308rk Airport in Istanbul. So what gives? A France24 investigation provides the answer. Twitter screengrab via France24 This same guy has been identified through social media as a terror victim in the wake of several recent incidents, including the EgyptAir crash last month, the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, and the deadly attack at the Turkish airport. He\u2019s also been connected to other sorts of tragedies, including an incident in Mexico when police shot at a crowd of people protesting education reform. But instead of identifying him as a victim, social media users said he was the person who ordered the police to shoot. Twitter screengrab via France24 All these claims are, obviously, false. Regrettably, these social media shenanigans have been picked up by the media; the man\u2019s photo is currently included in a New York Times video about the victims of the Orlando shooting. Following a BBC article about internet fakes and rumors, an investigative team at France24 decided to dig a little further to find out who this man really is and why this keeps happening to him. It turns out this mysterious individual may be a bit of a scam artist\u2014or at the very least, a very shitty friend\u2014and this prank is how his victims are enacting their revenge. The social media users who crafted the fake posts all told France24 a similar story, that they knew the man and he had cheated them out of money, ranging from small sums up to $1,000. \"Our goal is to ruin his reputation,\" said one of the perpetrators, \"We want the whole world to recognize his face.\" Tweets like this appeared in various media outlets, including the BBC. France24 managed to contact the person pictured in the photos, but have decided not to publish his real name. He\u2019s based in Mexico and admitted that he\u2019s currently embroiled in legal proceedings, telling France24 that, \"My photo is everywhere because of someone who started it as a prank after a legal dispute.\" He said he contacted media outlets like the BBC and the New York Times and asked them to delete his photo, \"but they never responded.\" So what recourse does someone have in situations like this? In most countries, laws on cyber-harassment are still in their infancy. Existing media law can sometimes come into play, and alleged victims can sue for slander or defamation. Penalties can be severe, and even include jail time. Sponsored In this particular case, the man has avoided any kind of legal action, telling France24 that in Mexico, \"nothing ever happens in these kind of cases.\" [France24]", "I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted. On the product side, we\u2019ve been busy. Both our iPhone and Android apps have had multiple releases, and we\u2019re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we\u2019re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this live thread, and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog. We\u2019ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we\u2019d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We\u2019re still in the early days, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re dedicating resources to it. As it relates to monetization, we\u2019ve made a handful of changes: we tested adding affiliate tags to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off we announced Promoted User Posts and we announced tests we\u2019ll be running on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don\u2019t want to compromise what\u2019s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place. Yesterday, we previewed new moderator mail to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We\u2019ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout. We\u2019ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We\u2019ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process. Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.", "The injustice orchestrated by lab chemist Annie Dookhan was first revealed five years ago, after she had been working for the Massachusetts state drug lab for nearly a decade to help prosecutors, in her words, get drug dealers \"off the streets.\" Then the lab chemist once called \"superwoman\" for her exceptional speed running tests told state police that she had \"screwed up big-time.\" In the year that followed, authorities would call into question the convictions of tens of thousands of drug cases handled by Dookhan in the Massachusetts state drug lab. There was a reason she was so fast, it turned out: She eventually told investigators she tripled the productivity rates of her colleagues by not actually testing all the drugs that came before her, forging her co-workers\u2019 initials and mixing drug samples so that her shoddy analysis matched the results she gave prosecutors. Her motivation, according to her attorney, reflected the overachiever mentality she had exhibited throughout her life: to be \"the hardest working and most prolific and most productive chemist.\" But the full consequences of her crimes became clear only this week when prosecutors in eight Boston-area counties announced they would dismiss 21,587 drug cases tainted by Dookhan\u2019s misconduct. On Thursday, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court made those dismissals official. The American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts called it the largest dismissal of convictions in U.S. history. \"Today is a major victory for justice, fairness, and the tens of thousands of people who were wrongfully convicted based on fabricated evidence,\" ACLU executive director Carol Rose said in a statement. It appears Dookhan has remained mum since her own conviction in 2013 for these deceptions, which the Supreme Judicial Court once said \"cast a shadow over the entire criminal justice system.\" Her silence is not surprising. Profiles by the Boston Globe and Associated Press from years ago, when Dookhan was first arrested, portray the Trinidad-born immigrant as soft-spoken, work-obsessed and deeply private. She was a go-getter so anxious to please, former friends and colleagues said, that she made a habit of stretching the truth \u2014 and sometimes outright lying \u2014 to inflate her personal narrative. The turning point, the reports suggest, may have come in 2009, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts that defendants in drug cases have a right to confront the chemists who test the drugs. Chemists, as a result, wound up spending a lot more time in court and a lot less time in their labs. While the productivity of Dookhan\u2019s fellow chemists dropped off, Dookhan\u2019s continued to skyrocket. By the end of 2009, the Globe reported that other chemists had completed an average of 1,981 tests. Dookhan had run 6,321. That year, she also told police she started to \"dry-lab\" to further increase her productivity so she could keep up. Dry-labbing is essentially identifying the drugs as what they were suspected to be. If a sample was returned to her after a retest revealed it wasn\u2019t what she said it was, she would contaminate it so it matched. \"My colleagues call me \u2018superwoman\u2019 and say that I do too much for the lab and everyone else, in general,\" Dookhan wrote in an email to an assistant district attorney, reported the Globe. \"I am not a workaholic, but it is just in my nature to assist in any way possible.\" At an unassuming 4 feet 11 inches, Dookhan had gotten the nickname \"Little Annie.\" But \"Little Annie\" turned out to be a big liar. One of Annie Dookhan\u2019s first known fibs played out on her re\u0301sume\u0301 20 years ago, according to the Globe, when she claimed she had graduated from her prestigious Boston prep school, Boston Latin Academy, \"magna cum laude.\" But that distinction, according to the school, did not exist. She peddled other exaggerations and lies \u2014 about her parents\u2019 job titles, her job titles, her salary and divorce proceedings. Most damning though, beyond the tampered drug tests, was the lie she told about advanced degrees she never earned, which ultimately resulted in additional charges. She once swore under oath she earned a master\u2019s degree, which she hadn\u2019t. There was no doubt about her intelligence. Classmates, professors at the University of Massachusetts, bosses and colleagues all attested to that in interviews with the Globe. She would come to work early and leave late, never resting for lunch or snacks and often taking work home with her. \"She wanted to be able to say that she was an accomplished person,\" Anthony Parham, Dookhan\u2019s former supervisor at a vaccine lab where she had previously worked, told the Globe. \"She grew up very isolated, without many people of her background around her,\" said Parham, who is African American. \"I understand what it is like to be a minority in America. I think that experience reinforced her determination to show that she was just as good, or even better.\" Dookhan started working for the state drug lab in 2004, and in her first full year on the job tested 9,239 drug samples, three times more than other chemists in the lab. The following year, that number jumped to 11,232, four times the average chemist and nearly double the second-most productive person behind her. The year she started at the state lab, Dookhan married Surrendranath Dookhan, who would years later send frantic text messages to a district attorney his wife had befriended. In them, he told the former assistant Norfolk County district attorney George Papachristos that his chemist wife was \"looking for sympathy and attention.\" \"This is Annie\u2019s husband do not believe her, she\u2019s a liar, she\u2019s always lying,\" one text message said. Papachristos later resigned from his district attorney job after news reports of his personal friendship with Dookhan. At work, colleagues began to question the lab\u2019s most unrealistically productive chemist, and in 2010, supervisors conducted a paperwork audit of her work but found no problems, reported the Associated Press. They did not retest her samples. In June 2011, she was suspended from lab duties after she was caught forging a colleague\u2019s initials. It wasn\u2019t until March 2012, after nearly a decade on the job, that Dookhan resigned. That\u2019s when she said \"I screwed up big-time,\" according to a state police report. \"I messed up bad. It\u2019s my fault.\" In 2013, Dookhan pleaded guilty to 27 counts of misleading investigators, tampering with evidence and filing false reports. She was sentenced to three years in prison, plus probation. A year ago this month, Dookhan was released. The court has asked prosecutors to decide which cases to retry and which to drop. Meanwhile, authorities in Massachusetts are now dealing with a second major scandal at the Massachusetts state drug lab stemming from the disclosure last year that another chemist, Sonja Farak, was actively stealing and using seized drug samples while analyzing them. She pleaded guilty in 2014. The consequences of Farak\u2019s case are still to be calculated.", "The average person sleeps for around eight hours a day. Over a lifetime this amounts to spending about one third of life asleep. It\u2019s common knowledge that a good nights rest is vitally important for maintaining health and balance, both mentally and physically. However, for some people a good night\u2019s sleep is hard to come by, or it ends up being ruined, by a strange phenomenon that is called sleep paralysis. It happens when your mind wakes up before your body ever gets a chance to. You can breathe normally, you can see and understand everything around you, but you can\u2019t move a muscle no matter how hard you try. The feelings that run through your mind when sleep paralysis occurs are overwhelming and the whole experience can be summed up as terrifying. Many people report that right before waking they hear a loud bang or waves crashing in their head which suddenly jars them awake. Others report that they do in fact have difficulty breathing and that it feels as if someone were choking them. These moments can last from a few seconds to several minutes or longer and most commonly show up initially during one\u2019s teenage years. The sensation of waking up and not being able to move is thought to affect less than 8% of the general population. There are no serious risks attributed to sleep paralysis on its own, medically speaking, rather the mental and physical damage may occur in the long run. While there may be genetic factors that contribute to it, the main causes are thought to be a lack of sleep, schedule changes, and sleeping on ones back. Back in earlier times it used to be thought that demons or evil forces were behind the strange phenomenon and it\u2019s easy to see why. Here are 8 terrifying facts about it: 1) No one knows for sure what causes it- Science and researchers have yet to find a definitive cause or explanation as to what may trigger it. It has been a mystery for thousands of years and to this day it remains one. 2) It feels like you\u2019re dead- Many people equate the experience of waking up and being unable to move, while fully mentally awake, to feeling like they\u2019re dead. Basically, it\u2019s a type of out of body experience that you never want to experience. 3) It can happen when you\u2019re trying to fall asleep- It doesn\u2019t only occur when you wake up. It can occur at two points in the sleep cycle when your body transitions between going into, and coming out of, the REM (deep sleep) stage. 4) If you suffer from a lack of sleep it\u2019s more likely to happen to you- Studies have indicated that individuals who suffer from chronic sleep issues, and who routinely don\u2019t get enough sleep, are more likely to have an episode of sleep paralysis than their well-rested counterparts. 5) Your nightmare may continue- A lot of people have reported that they feel like they\u2019re in a living nightmare even after they wake up because they open their eyes and see hallucinations. They are mentally alert and know they are awake, but their minds and eyes see things that aren\u2019t there, and it\u2019s all too freakishly real. 6) It can feel like a demon is sitting on your chest- A common description given of what it feels like is that there is something heavy and bothersome weighing on your chest. Yikes! 7) There is no way to wake your body up- You literally have to wait for your body to snap out if it. No cough or blink will wake you, contrary to some beliefs. 8) It can happen to anybody\u2013 You may have already experienced it at some point in your life, not everyone is aware that it happened, and practically everyone will go through it at least once over the course of their lifetime.", "In April a BMW racing through a fruit market in Foshan in China\u2019s Guangdong province knocked down a 2-year-old girl and rolled over her head. As the girl\u2019s grandmother shouted, \"Stop! You\u2019ve hit a child!\" the BMW\u2019s driver paused, then switched into reverse and backed up over the girl. The woman at the wheel drove forward once more, crushing the girl for a third time. When she finally got out from the BMW, the unlicensed driver immediately offered the horrified family a deal: \"Don\u2019t say that I was driving the car,\" she said. \"Say it was my husband. We can give you money.\" It seems like a crazy urban legend: In China, drivers who have injured pedestrians will sometimes then try to kill them. And yet not only is it true, it\u2019s fairly common; security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. The Chinese language even has an adage for the phenomenon: \"It is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure.\" This 2008 television report features security camera footage of a dusty white Passat reversing at high speed and smashing into a 64-year-old grandmother. The Passat\u2019s back wheels bounce up over her head and body. The driver, Zhao Xiao Cheng, stops the car for a moment then hits the gas, causing his front wheels to roll over the woman. Then Zhao shifts into drive, wheels grinding the woman into the pavement. Zhao is not done. Twice more he shifts back and forth between drive and reverse, each time thudding over the grandmother\u2019s body. He then speeds away from her corpse. Incredibly, Zhao was found not guilty of intentional homicide. Accepting Zhao\u2019s claim that he thought he was driving over a trash bag, the court of Taizhou in Zhejiang province sentenced him to just three years in prison for \"negligence.\" Zhao\u2019s case was unusual only in that it was caught on video. As the television anchor noted, \"You can see online an endless stream of stories talking about cases similar to this one.\" \"Double-hit cases\" have been around for decades. I first heard of the \"hit-to-kill\" phenomenon in Taiwan in the mid-1990s when I was working there as an English teacher. A fellow teacher would drive us to classes. After one near-miss of a motorcyclist, he said, \"If I hit someone, I\u2019ll hit him again and make sure he\u2019s dead.\" Enjoying my shock, he explained that in Taiwan, if you cripple a man, you pay for the injured person\u2019s care for a lifetime. But if you kill the person, you \"only have to pay once, like a burial fee.\" He insisted he was serious\u2014and that this was common. A Slate Plus Special Feature: How Can This Possibly Happen? Geoffrey Sant wrote about drivers in China who intentionally kill pedestrians. Ask him anything. Most people agree that the hit-to-kill phenomenon stems at least in part from perverse laws on victim compensation. In China the compensation for killing a victim in a traffic accident is relatively small\u2014amounts typically range from $30,000 to $50,000\u2014and once payment is made, the matter is over. By contrast, paying for lifetime care for a disabled survivor can run into the millions. The Chinese press recently described how one disabled man received about $400,000 for the first 23 years of his care. Drivers who decide to hit-and-kill do so because killing is far more economical. Indeed, Zhao Xiao Cheng\u2014the man caught on a security camera video driving over a grandmother five times\u2014ended up paying only about $70,000 in compensation. Security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. In 2010 in Xinyi, video captured a wealthy young man reversing his BMW X6 out of a parking spot. He hits a 3-year-old boy, knocking the child to the ground and rolling over his skull. The driver then shifts his BMW into drive and crushes the child again. Remarkably, the driver then gets out of the BMW, puts the vehicle in reverse, and guides it with his hand as he walks the vehicle backward over the boy\u2019s crumpled body. The man\u2019s foot is so close to the toddler\u2019s head that, if alive, the boy could have reached out and touched him. The driver then puts the BMW in drive again, running over the boy one last time as he drives away. Here too, the driver was charged only with accidentally causing a person\u2019s death. (He claimed to have confused the boy with a cardboard box or trash bag.) Police rejected charges of murder and even of fleeing the scene of the crime, ignoring the fact that the driver ran over the boy\u2019s head as he sped away. These drivers are willing to kill not only because it is cheaper, but also because they expect to escape murder charges. In the days before video cameras became widespread, it was rare to have evidence that a driver hit the victim twice. Even in today\u2019s age of cellphone cameras, drivers seem confident that they can either bribe local officials or hire a lawyer to evade murder charges. Perhaps the most horrific of these hit-to-kill cases are the ones in which the initial collision didn\u2019t injure the victim seriously, and yet the driver came back and killed the victim anyway. In Sichuan province, an enormous, dirt-encrusted truck knocked down a 2-year-old boy. The toddler was only dazed by the initial blow, and immediately climbed to his feet. Eyewitnesses said that the boy went to fetch his umbrella, which had been thrown across the street by the impact, when the truck reversed and crushed him, this time killing him. Despite the eyewitness testimony, the county chief of police declared that the truck had never reversed, never hit the boy a second time, and that the wheels never rolled over the child. Meanwhile, one outraged website posted photographs appearing to show the child\u2019s body under the truck\u2019s front wheel. In each of these cases, despite video and photographs showing that the driver hit the victim a second, and often even a third, fourth, and fifth time, the drivers ended up paying the same or less in compensation and jail time than they would have if they had merely injured the victim. With so many hit-to-kill drivers escaping serious punishment, the Chinese public has sometimes taken matters into its own hands. In 2013 a crowd in Zhengzhou in Henan province beat a wealthy driver who killed a 6-year-old after allegedly running him over twice. (A television report claims the crowd had acted on \"false rumors.\" However, at least five witnesses assert on camera that the man had run over the child a second time.) Of course, not every hit-to-kill driver escapes serious punishment. A man named Yao Jiaxin who in 2010 hit a bicyclist in Xian and returned to make sure she was dead\u2014even stabbing the injured woman with a knife\u2014was convicted and executed. In 2014 a driver named Zhang Qingda who had hit an elderly man in Jiayu Pass in Gansu province with his pickup truck and circled around to crush the man again was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Both China and Taiwan have passed laws attempting to eradicate hit-to-kill cases. Taiwan\u2019s legislature reformed Article 6 of its Civil Code, which had long restricted the ability to bring civil lawsuits on behalf of others (such as a person killed in a traffic accident). Meanwhile, China\u2019s legislature has emphasized that multiple-hit cases should be treated as murders. Yet even when a driver hits a victim multiple times, it can be hard to prove intent and causation\u2014at least to the satisfaction of China\u2019s courts. Judges, police, and media often seem to accept rather unbelievable claims that the drivers hit the victims multiple times accidentally, or that the drivers confused the victims with inanimate objects. Hit-to-kill cases continue, and hit-to-kill drivers regularly escape serious punishment. In January a woman was caught on video repeatedly driving over an old man who had slipped in the snow. In April a school bus driver in Shuangcheng was accused of driving over a 5-year-old girl again and again. In May a security camera filmed a truck driver running over a young boy four times; the driver claimed that he had never noticed the child. And last month the unlicensed woman who had killed the 2-year-old in the fruit market with her BMW\u2014and then offered to bribe the family\u2014was brought to court. She claimed the killing was an accident. Prosecutors accepted her assertion, and recommended that the court reduce her sentence to two to four years in prison.", "The scent of lavender is known for its soothing properties, and for this reason is often recommended to people as a relaxation or sleep aid. But according to new research, the calming scent can also make us more trusting of others. \"Our results might have various serious implications for a broad range of situations in which interpersonal trust is an essential element,\" Leiden psychologist Roberta Sellaro said in a statement. \"Smelling the aroma of lavender may help a seller to establish more easily a trusting negotiation to sell a car, or in a grocery store it may induce consumers to spend more money buying products. The smell of lavender may also be helpful in sport psychology to enhance trust and build team spirit, for example in the case of team games such as soccer and volleyball.\" To investigate the flower's effect on trust, Leiden University researchers exposed one group of study participants to the scent of lavender and another group to peppermint. Then, the participants were asked to play a game that is commonly used in experimental settings to measure how much one subject trusts another. In the game, a \"trustor\" was given 5 Euros and instructed to decide how much of that money to give a \"trustee\" in each round. The trustee, in return, could decide to split the money with the trustor. If the trustee gave the trustor enough money in return, he or she would receive additional money. After being exposed to lavender, participants gave significantly more money to the trustee (3.9 Euro) than those who had been exposed to peppermint (3.23 Euro). The findings \"reinforce the idea that interpersonal trust is sensitive to situational and environmental factors,\" the researchers note. Previous research on aromatherapy has found that lavender can affect mood and well-being. Lavender essential oil produces a mild calming and sedative affect, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center, and has been used to ease anxiety, depression, insomnia and fatigue. One brain-scanning study by Wesleyan University researchers found that participants who sniffed lavender oil before going to bed slept more soundly through the night.", "Artist Anish Kapoor, who is an internationally renowned British-Indian sculptor, acquired the exclusive rights to a pigment called Vantablack. Developed by Surrey NanoSystems, it is made up of a series of microscopic vertical tubes; and when light hits the colour, it doesn\u2019t bounce off as is the case with regular colours and instead it becomes trapped. Nearly all of the light is swallowed up - 99.6 per cent to be exact - creating the darkest substance yet known. Kapoor, who also designed the 2012 Olympics' Orbit Tower, has been working with the colour for over two years, and told The Guardian that what had attracted him to the colour was his fascination with \u2018void forms\u2019. In collaboration with NanoSystems, Kapoor has been working towards creating art with the substance, which is proving difficult because of the particular way it is manufactured: only two square centimetres can be made at a time, and both he and the scientists are hoping to manufacture the colour in bulk. But many people - both in the art community and the public at large - criticise his monopoly over the use of the colour. So pissed that only Anish Kapoor has the rights to use VantaBlack #vantablack in art bull... \u2014 GengarsMammy (@TheRealBarenzia) September 9, 2016 Russell Elliott, who represents artists in the UK and the rest of the world, told the Telegraph earlier this year: Rather like Christian Furr, I haven't heard of any artist who has previously been granted a monopoly on a particular colour before, and it does seem to set an unfortunate precedent. Previously, companies have stipulated the pantone reference in their logo guidelines and this has become standard practice. Kapoor has attempted to address his critics: Why exclusive? Because it\u2019s a collaboration, because I am wanting to push them to a certain use for it. I\u2019ve collaborated with people who make things out of stainless steel for years and that\u2019s exclusive. Kapoor\u2019s fascination with colour and emotion is prevalent in his work, and he previously used the colour red expansively in an installation called \u2018Shooting into the Corner\u2019 at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.", "Conventional wisdom says that when you attend a designer's runway show during Fashion Week, you're supposed to wear an outfit by that designer. It's a way to prove your allegiance and to represent the brand. Well, Tuesday's Marc by Marc Jacobs' showgoers did exactly that. More women than we can count on one hand wore looks from the designer's Fall 2013 collection. That's not out of the ordinary, per se... but what was pretty weird was how many women we spotted wearing the exact same outfit. Out of a 52-look collection, two patterns positively exploded. We can see why -- these outfits are pretty darn adorable. See for yourself in the photos below!", "Have you ever felt that your cat or dog can see something you don\u2019t? Well, you may be right, according to a new study. Cats, dogs, and other mammals are thought to see in ultraviolet light, which opens up a whole different world than the one we see, the study explains. Seeing the World in Ultraviolet (UV) Light UV light is the wave length beyond the visible light from red to violet that humans can see. Humans have a lens that blocks UV from reaching the retina. It was previously thought that most mammals have lenses similar to humans. Scientists studied the lenses of dead mammals, including cats, dogs, monkeys, pandas, hedgehogs, and ferrets. By researching how much light passes through the lens to reach the retina, they concluded that some mammals previously thought not to be able to see UV actually can. \"Nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet, but in fact, they do,\" Ron Douglas, the study leader and a biologist at City University London, England, told LiveScience. What purpose does being able to see UV light serve for animals such as reindeer, rodents, and other mammals? It allows reindeer to see polar bears, for example, which are nearly invisible in regular light because they blend in with the snow. UV light also allows mammals to see urine trails. This would be helpful for predator animals, such as cats and dogs, to find food in the wild.

Start here with these ten easy and delicious rules. 1. Rule #1: Eat Two Pounds Of Vegetables Every single day. \"Loading your diet with vegetables will naturally crowd out things you shouldn't be eating,\" says Joel Fuhrman, MD, author of Eat to Live Cookbook, who recommends this amount after analyzing studies connecting vegetable consumption with overall health. Aim for one pound raw and one pound cooked: Certain cancer-fighting compounds in some vegetables, like broccoli, cabbage, and kale, are better absorbed raw, while cooking others (carrots, sweet corn) can boost their levels of antioxidants. Though two pounds might sound like a lot, a single sweet potato can get you a quarter of the way there. \"You don't necessarily need to measure your food; just use this figure as a reminder to eat a hefty amount of veggies every day,\" Fuhrman says. \"Work in cooked greens and interesting stir-fries, and you're set.\" Rule #2: Put An Egg On It So long as you have eggs in the refrigerator, you can throw together a healthy dinner in the same amount of time you'd need to order takeout. You can top a pita with a baked (or fried) egg and some cheese (see recipe below) or add an egg to a bowl of rice, dressed salad greens, or cooked vegetables. Get the recipe: Egg-Topped Pita Pizza Rule #3: Sub In Seeds These oft-forgotten all-stars come packed with key nutrients we all need: protein, healthy fats, and essential fatty acids. Toss a handful of hempseeds into the blender when making a smoothie, sprinkle chia seeds or flaxseeds on top of oatmeal, or swap sunflower or pumpkin seeds wherever you usually use nuts, like in this winter pesto, which tastes delicious spread on a sandwich or drizzled over roasted squash. Get the recipe: Spinach-Pepita Pesto Rule #4: Make Your Own Junk Food Sure, there are moments when no one can come between you and your potato chips. Which is why banning them isn't the goal -- it's making them at home. \"Junk food is wonderful,\" says Michael Pollan, author of Cooked. \"But it's become so cheap that we eat it too often. When we used to have to make it ourselves -- and a long time ago we did! -- there was a built-in check on overconsumption.\" Take French fries: You peel the potatoes, cut them into matchsticks, fry them in oil, and make a mess in your kitchen while you're at it. If you decide to go the DIY route, says Pollan, \"you will not do that more than once a month -- I promise you.\" Processed Food 101 Eating more real food doesn't mean avoiding all packaged goods. While anything that comes in a sealed bag or a box is \"processed\" to some degree (the term simply refers to food that's been changed from its original state), not all packaging automatically indicates a dietary no-no. Here's what to look for. Buy Washed greens, sliced vegetables, and roasted nuts: They're minimally processed, simply prepped for convenience. Packaged at their peak (to lock in flavor and nutrition), canned beans and tomatoes and frozen produce are also fine choices. But you don't have to limit yourself to these. The real trick is reading labels: \"If you recognize most ingredients as food,\" says Darya Pino Rose, PhD, author of Foodist, \"or what comes from the ground or an animal, you're in good shape.\" Skip Packaged foods with unpronounceable ingredients and processed with added sweeteners, oils, and preservatives to boost flavor and texture or extend shelf life. A few major culprits: chips, crackers, and microwavable meals you find in the freezer aisle. Says Rose: \"If it's frozen with a lot of ingredients, you're shopping in the wrong section.\" Rule #5: Prep Breakfast \"If you feel overwhelmed by the transition to eating more real food, just start with breakfast,\" says Lisa Leake, blogger at 100DaysofRealFood.com, who challenged herself and her family to avoid highly processed food and has never looked back. \"Most of us eat the same thing in the morning, so changing this one meal can have a big impact.\" Follow Leake's lead and carve out time on Sundays to make a week's worth of breakfasts, like these parfaits. Assemble the yogurt and fruit and store the parfaits in individual jars, one for each day of the week, in the refrigerator. Top with granola when you're ready to eat. Get the recipe: Maple Granola and Yogurt Parfaits Rule #6: Build Your Bases Make your life easier by preparing batches of foods you can combine into multiple meals. Start with a pot of grains or beans -- or both -- every week. \"A pound of dried beans costs about $1. Once they're cooked, it's a snap to add them to any soup or salad,\" says Mark Bittman, New York Times food columnist and author of VB6 and the forthcoming VB6 Cookbook. Apply this strategy to roasted vegetables (broccoli, butternut squash) and dressed hardier greens (kale, Swiss chard). \"Don't roast just two sweet potatoes; roast six,\" he says. \"The more you cook and have stuff around, the less you'll depend on junk.\" Start with these fridge-friendly staples. Kale In a large bowl, combine 2 stemmed, chopped bunches of Tuscan or lacinato kale (2 pounds), 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and the zest and juice of 1 lemon. Season with pepper and massage until softened, 5 minutes. When ready to eat, salt to taste. Makes about 10 cups. Sweet Potatoes Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Prick 6 medium sweet potatoes with a fork. Transfer to a baking sheet and roast until tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Herb-Tahini Dressing In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, add 1\u20442 cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley, 1\u20442 cup tahini, 6 roughly chopped scallions, 2 cloves garlic, the zest and juice of 2 lemons, 2 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar, 1\u20442 tsp. salt, and 1\u20442 tsp. pepper and pulse to combine. With the motor running, add 1/3 cup olive oil in a thin stream until combined. Makes 1 cup. Farro In a medium pot, combine 3 cups water, 1 cup rinsed farro, and 1\u20444 tsp. salt. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Drain excess water. Makes 3 cups. Store each base in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to a week and reheat as needed. Mix and Match Your Make-Aheads Tacos: Whole wheat tortilla + Sweet potato mashed with spoonful of plain yogurt + Dressed kale + Sliced avocado Kale Salad: Dressed kale + Herb-tahini dressing + Cooked farro + Kalamata olives + Thinly sliced cucumber Winter Farro: Cooked farro + Dressed kale + Shaved Parmesan + Toasted walnuts + Golden raisins Topped Sweet Potato: Split-open baked sweet potato + Cooked faro + Shredded rotisserie chicken + Herb-tahini dressing Rule #7: Eat a Vegan Lunch Each year, the average American consumes 175 pounds of meat and poultry, almost double the global average. Eating less red meat may do you a favor: It can lower your risk of cancer and heart disease. \"Learn to love big heaps of vegetables,\" Bittman says, \"and pile them on until you're more than satisfied.\" To achieve that feeling, try meatless proteins, such as lentils, edamame (see the Soba Noodle Bowl, below), and tofu (\"so underappreciated; it's a blank slate you can do a lot with,\" he says). \"Head to a place with options, like a salad bar, and experiment.\" Get the recipe: Soba Noodle Bowl Rule #8: Ditch the Whites White Flour The milling process strips the grains of most of their nutrition. The result: \"White flour digests in your body rapidly, which makes blood sugar spike,\" says Foodist author Rose. (Cue the almost inevitable crash.) \"It should be a supplement to your diet, not the main event.\" Try more-nutritious flours, like almond, coconut, and chickpea. One easy way to start: Substitute white whole wheat flour for 1/3 cup (or more) of the white flour in recipes. White Sugar Research suggests that sugar can be addictive. And it's a sneaky ingredient added to processed foods that don't even taste sweet, like bread and pasta sauce. Reach for organic honey or maple syrup instead; they're less refined and offer small amounts of antioxidants. (Still, aim for no more than 24 grams of added sugar per day.) Steer clear of foods with sugar listed among the first three ingredients -- and that includes agave nectar, evaporated cane juice, malt syrup, and anything ending in \"-ose.\" (\"There are 1,001 code names!\" warns Rose.) Rule #9: Go with the Grains \"Ancient varieties are super-nutrient-rich and offer long-lasting energy,\" says Mollie Katzen, author of the cookbook The Heart of the Plate. And it doesn't take much for quinoa, amaranth, and spelt to go beyond ho-hum: \"Once you add saute\u0301ed garlic or scallions, they come to life.\" These staples also add texture and heft when stirred into soups and stews and sprinkled on salad greens. Here are five ways to cook supergrains in less than 30 minutes. Rule #10: Don't Ban Dessert \"You can totally build dessert into healthy eating,\" says Ellie Krieger, host of the Food Network show Healthy Appetite. \"If you say, 'I'm never having it,' you give all things sweet an enticing, forbidden-fruit aura. When you inevitably give in, it becomes a mindless munchfest.\" Reach for better-for-you desserts like this clever chocolate pudding, made creamy by its secret ingredient: avocado.

In an article he has written for the Los Angeles Times over a month ago, he described the restaurant\u2019s chicken as \u2018pretty much the right call\u2019, with its slightly vinegar taste and nice crispness. He even suggested trying the halo-halo after the main course. The restaurant\u2019s branch in Glendale joins other Asian establishments such as Merry\u2019s House of Chicken from Indonesia, OB Bear from Korea and Tokyo Fried Chicken from Japan. Aside from its chicken, Max's is known for serving traditional Pinoy fare such as crispy pata, kare-kare and sinigang. Max\u2019s was first established post-World War II, which was initially a cafe\u0301 that served simple dishes to American soldiers. The owner\u2019s niece, Ruby Gimenez, created the recipe that has been their signature chicken, and the rest is history. Like the rest of other local fast food chains, Max\u2019s has kept up with its expansion to the point that they have branches in every part of the country. They have now targeted North America for its global expansion, where California has the most branches so far.

Well, if you're single, the state of your facial hair can attract flings or long-term relationships, depending on how you style it, according to new research from Wiley. In the study, published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology, researchers had 8,520 women rate the physical attractiveness of men with varying degrees of facial hair, all of which were manipulated using computer graphics. The researchers also played with traditionally male-typical features, like a more pronounced brow and jawline (which, the team says, can signify underlying health\u2014thanks to evolution; beards on the other hand can signal a man's age, even social status, and dominance. Bottom line: Beardedness (or lack there of) had a major influence on a guy's sex appeal and perceived masculinity.

But studies consistently show that altruism is a top quality women are drawn to when they are looking for a relationship. And a new study in the British Journal of Psychology found that altruistic men may have more sex, too. The researchers asked unmarried Canadian adults how much they did good deeds like giving money to charity or helping someone get their car out of the snow. They then asked the participants how often they had sex and how many partners they've had. Men who reported more altruistic acts had more sex \u2014 and more partners. For those who were in relationships, good-hearted men were more likely to have had more sex in the last 30 days, too. mangostock/Shutterstock In the second experiment of the study, the researchers had undergraduate students say whether they would like to donate money that they might receive for participating to charity. Those who said that they would also tended to have more casual sex, more sex in relationships, and more lifetime sex partners overall. Another study, published in January 2016 in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, presented 202 women with different men to choose from. The different combinations of choices were either attractive or not, and they either did a good deed or didn't. The women chose the selfish, attractive men for a one-night stand. But for a long-term relationship, they chose the altruistic man whether he was attractive or not. A slightly older study, published in The Journal of Social Psychology in 2013, really drives this home. That study found that women valued altruism above other traits as a measure of whether a potential mate would make a good parent. The women also said that altruism was important for short-term relationships, but significantly more women said that the trait mattered for the long term. Yet another study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in July 2015, analyzed Germans' responses to a large annual survey. Single people who reported doing good deeds were much more likely to say that they were in a relationship the next year. They also took less time to find a partner than their non-altruistic peers. All of this is not to say that other traits don't matter. Humor is also important to women selecting a mate, researchers have found. It makes women assume that a man is more intelligent. A sense of humor is a good indicator of sexual activity, too. In one study, men whom women rated as funnier reported having more sex with more partners. For building long-term relationships, though, researchers find over and over again that altruism is a crucial and highly desirable trait. Psychologists have yet to pit humor head-to-head against altruism. It's also important to keep in mind that many of these studies are small, and that people often behave differently in real life than they do in a lab setting, or when responding to a survey. Especially when reporting positive experiences like charity work or sex, men may be more likely to overestimate how much they actually do those things. And because of the way that these kinds of studies are designed, they can't say conclusively that it's altruism specifically that's attractive. It might be other traits associated with altruism, or that men attractive for other reasons might also happen to be altruistic. But the large number of studies and the consistent findings in favor of altruism are building a pretty solid case that there are some side benefits to doing good deeds. No matter what, if you're a man seeking a woman \u2014 especially for a long-term partnership \u2014 helping others can't hurt.", "In a verbal exchange picked up during the broadcast of Thursday night's battle between rivals Golden State Warriors and LA Clippers, silver-tongued All-Star forward Draymond Green was more than happy to remind soon-to-be-retired superstar Paul Pierce he \"can't get no farewell tour,\" telling him, \"They don't love you like that.

According to the Post, the quote is taken from Anglund's 1967 book of poems \"A Cup of Sun.\" The only difference is the pronouns are changed from \"he\" in Anglund's poem to \"it\" on the stamp. Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders told the Post that he was unaware of the Anglund quote, pointing out that \"numerous references\" attributed the quote to Angelou. Indeed, President Obama attributed the same quote to Angelou during the presentation of the 2013 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal. \"The Postal Service used her widely recognized quote to help build an immediate connection between her image and her 1969 nationally recognized autobiography, 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'\" Saunders said in a statement.

Judge Paul Darlow told him: \u2018This was a callous web of rehearsed and repeated lies, carefully-honed and mainly directed by you at women because of their vulnerabilities or simply because of their inherent caring natures. \u2018I have no doubt that none of these women would have let you near them if they had known the truth about you.\u2019 Brain\u2019s offences took place between 2012 and 2015, netting him more than \u00a340,000. One of his victims, a 75-year-old Cornish woman, loaned him \u00a320,055 to pay various bills after meeting through the website Badoo. But the court heard Brain had spent the money on drinking and gambling. Nick Lewin, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said Brain had used several dating websites including Plenty of Fish, Badoo and Smooch to bombard women with flattering messages. He added that Brain could be at various stages of relationships with as many as four women at any time. Mr Lewin said he used \u2018sophisticated and cynical lies\u2019 to worm his way into the affections of his targets. He added: \u2018He claimed he was the victim of sexual violence or an abusive or controlling relationship.\u2019 Brain was only recently released from prison for similar offences after being jailed for 70 weeks in January, when another judge dubbed him a \u2018cash card Casanova\u2019.", "Facebook is like a fridge, you keep checking, but never find anything good. Facebook has become an important part of our lives. It is no more a platform to just connect with people. It lets you know things happening in the other corner of the world. It gives you insights into what has been going on in your friend\u2019s life and moreover, acts as a reminder for everyone\u2019s birthdays. But while you may be more than thankful to Facebook for reminding you the birthdays of your forgotten friends, you wouldn\u2019t really want to be after reading this. Cyber security experts have warned Facebook users to delete their birth date and all other personal information as soon as possible. It has been noticed that the amount of personal information revealed on the various social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn has led to increasing number of cyber crime cases. All the personal information that has been put up there has become a jackpot win for cyber thieves. Much to our surprise, cyber crime has risen by 57 per cent in the past 12 months. A report by fraud experts, Cifas, claimed that many scammers have been preying on social media accounts for personal details, reports the Daily Star. Cyber crime professionals suggest avoiding personal information like your phone number, address, email address, photos of your house, workplace or any other information about your family. The more information you share on social media, the more susceptible you are to be a victim of cyber crime.

The exact facts surrounding the births of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s children were shrouded in secrecy for security reasons \u2013 until now. To help her through the labour, Kate had at her disposal: two obstetricians, three midwives, three anaesthetists, four theatre staff, two special care baby unit staff, four paediatricians, one laboratory technician to check blood samples and four senior managers. The Duchess, 34, gave birth to both children at the exclusive Lindo Wing at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in Paddington, London. \"We had a huge team,\" Professor Tiong Ghee Teoh, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the hospital told The Daily Telegraph. \"I was back-up to Guy Thorpe-Beeston, who led the team, but for anything that could possibly go wrong we had a team of people behind each specialty. \"Everyone was sworn to secrecy about who it was.\" Professor Teoh said the team met monthly to discuss Kate\u2019s birth plan and then weekly as the due date got closer. Describing her as a \"fit young lady\", he added: \"They are the best patients. \"At the end of the day you want to deliver a healthy, happy baby to a healthy, happy mother \u2013 and that\u2019s what happened.\" But it seems Kate didn\u2019t really get any special royal treatment \u2013 according to Professor Teoh most mums-to-be have this amount of people involved in our births.

Google\u2019s now-banned interview questions have become the stuff of Internet folklore. But now, a former interviewee of Microsoft has revealed a question he was asked after applying for a job at the multi-billion dollar company. According to his story, their selection process is no more forgiving than Google's. Prashant Bagdia posted on the website Quora the story of his friend who went for a job interview at Microsoft. For the last question, the interviewer asked: \"A right triangle has a hypotenuse equal to 10 and an altitude to the hypotenuse equal to 6. Find the area of the triangle.\" Partly wondering why a software employer would be interested in a high school geometry question and partly wondering if this was a trick, the interviewee finally managed to piece together an answer he thought was correct, saying: \"Sir, as area of any triangle is 0.5*base*height, the answer to this question would be 0.5 *10*6 which evaluates to 30!\" But his confident response was shut down by the interviewer. He was offered another chance to think about the question, but he stuck to his guns and was quickly told his answer was incorrect. So why would they ask such a question? Well, rather deviously, a triangle with those measurements can\u2019t exist. As Prashant explains in his post , if the altitude is at a 45-degree angle and the hypotenuse is 10, then the largest the altitude can be is 5, as any higher altitude can\u2019t exist in a right-angled triangle.

As if that weren\u2019t shocking enough, Kimberly didn\u2019t even realize she was pregnant until she was 13 weeks along. The news that she would be having triplets was the cherry on top. With little time to get ready for her three babies, Kimberly and husband Craig were hardly prepared for what happened in the delivery room. \"It\u2019s all been rather overwhelming when you think about how many changes will have to be made,\" Kimberly tells People. \"But I am just trying to take everything one day at a time. I know it will all work out.\" Sometimes, pregnancies go from ordinary to extraordinary in an instant. Another couple, Sarah and Bill Imbierowicz, unexpectedly had two sets of triplets! Rather than take it as an unexpected burden or hurdle, they took it as a blessing. In 2013, Kimberly Fugate became pregnant in her early 40s. The mom, who was already a mother to a 10-year-old, Katelyn, was suddenly expecting triplets \u2014 rare triplets at that. She and her husband, Craig, conceived the babies without IVF. That\u2019s almost unheard of! Just before her 42nd birthday, after delivering three identical girls, doctors told her there was a little more in store. \"They had gotten the three out, and they said, \u2018More feet,'\" Kimberly told CNN. \"I said, \u2018No!\u2019 It was an instant shock.\" Kimberly and Craig had produced four identical quadruplet girls. Their names and birth order: Kenleigh Rosa, Kristen Sue, Kayleigh Pearl, and Kelsey Roxanne.\n The odds of conceiving spontaneous quadruplets are 1 to 729,000. However, the odds that they would be identical are almost incalculable at about 13 million to one.

Men and women under 21 years old are smoking marijuana because they can't drink legally, new data from the Journal of Health Economics suggests. Findings imply that, as soon as young people come of age, they ditch the weed and take up alcohol instead. For those under 21, marijuana could simply be the most accessible of the substances, but according to a University of Illinois study, Americans drastically switch from smoking marijuana to consuming booze when they change from 20 years and 11 months old to the legal drinking age. Researchers analyzed five years of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, along with responses from survey participants between the ages of 18 to 24 who recounted the number of times they'd consumed alcohol or used marijuana over the past 30 days. The likelihood that they had consumed alcohol within 30 days jumped by 16 percent, while pot use fell by 10 percent. Researchers regard the findings as essential to the debate over how to regulate the substances, how marijuana laws are enforced will ultimately affect alcohol use, and the other way around according to Ben Crost, a co-author of the study, \"If you think alcohol is much more harmful to people's health, then you should probably restrict alcohol use,\" Crost said in a statement. \"If you think marijuana is more harmful, then you might want to consider loosening the restrictions for alcohol.\" Crost suggests officials should reassess the minimum legal drinking age, noting restrictions on booze appear to push young adults towards illegal drugs.Or maybe weed doesn't need to be illegal.

[H/T: Washington Post]", "An Apple iPhone Photograph by Justin Sullivan \u2014 Getty Images Especially if you have something to hide. Apple issued a patch Thursday to fix a dangerous security flaw in iPhones and iPads after researchers discovered that a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident\u2019s phone had been targeted with a previously unknown method of hacking. The thwarted attack on the human rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, used a text message that invited him to click on a web link. Instead of clicking, he forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab. The hack is the first known case of software that can remotely take over a fully up-to-date iPhone 6. Experts at Citizen Lab worked with security company Lookout and determined that the link would have installed a program taking advantage of a three flaws that Apple and others were not aware of. The researchers disclosed their findings Thursday. \"Once infected, Mansoor\u2019s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone\u2019s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,\" Citizen Lab wrote in a report released Thursday. ( AAPL -0.43% ) The researchers said they had alerted Applea week and a half ago, and the company developed a fix and distributed it as an automatic update to iPhone 6 owners. Apple spokesman Fred Sainz confirmed that the company had issued the patch after being contacted by researchers. The Citizen Lab team attributed the attack software to a private seller of monitoring systems, NSO Group, an Israeli company that makes software for governments which can secretly target mobile phones and gather information. Tools such as that used in this case, a remote exploit for a current iPhone, cost as much as $1 million. NSO chief executive Shalev Hulio referred questions to spokesman Zamir Dahbash, who said the company \"cannot confirm the specific cases\" covered in the Citizen Lab and Lookout reports. Dahbash said NSO sells within export laws to government agencies, which then operate the software. \"The agreements signed with the company\u2019s customers require that the company\u2019s products only be used in a lawful manner,\" he added. \"Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.\" Dahbash did not answer follow-up questions, including whether the exposure of the tools use against Mansoor in UAE and a Mexican journalist would end any sales to those countries. Low Profile NSO has kept a low profile in the security world, despite its 2014 sale of a majority stake for $120 million to California private equity firm Francisco Partners. That company\u2019s chief executive, Dipanjan Deb, did not return a call Thursday. In November 2015, Reuters reported that NSO had begun calling itself \"Q\" and was looking for a buyer for close to $1 billion. Sarah McKune, senior legal adviser to Citizen Lab, said Israel tries to follow the strictures of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which puts controls on the international sale of nuclear and chemical weapons technology and more recently cyber intrusion tools. NSO may have had to apply for an export license, she added, saying that raised questions about \"what consideration was given to the human rights record of UAE.\" The Israeli embassy in Washington did not respond to an email seeking comment. NSO marketing material says that it also has capabilities for Android and BlackBerry devices. No version of the software has been exposed, indicating it remains effective. Citizen Lab did not directly accuse UAE of carrying out the attack on Mansoor with NSO gear called Pegasus, but it said other NSO attacks on critics of the regime were connected to the government. Others Targeted It also said a Mexican journalist and a minority party politician in Kenya had been targeted with NSO software and that domain names set up for other attacks referred to entities in Uzbekistan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other nations, suggesting that other targets lived in those nations. A call to the UAE embassy in Washington was not immediately returned. The market for \"lawful intercept,\" or government hacking tools, has come under increased scrutiny with revelations about authoritarian customers and noncriminal victims. Two popular vendors, Hacking Team of Italy and Gamma Group of the United Kingdom, have had their wares exposed by researchers or hackers. Mansoor had previously been targeted with software from both of those companies, according to Citizen Lab. \"I can\u2019t think of a more compelling case of serial misuse of lawful intercept malware than the targeting of Mansoor,\" said one of the Citizen Lab researchers, John Scott-Railton.", "Story highlights The National Vietnam Veterans Foundation raised nearly $9 million in 2014 But it donated less than 2% of that money Washington (CNN) At first glance, the National Vietnam Veterans Foundation is a roaring success. According to its tax filings, the charity has received more than $29 million in donations from generous Americans from 2010 to 2014 for what it calls on its website \"aiding, supporting and benefiting America's veterans and their families.\" But look a little closer on those same filings and you can see that nearly all of those donations have been cycled back to telemarketers, leaving less than 2 percent for actual veterans and veterans' charitable causes. That's why Charity Navigator, one of the nation's largest and most influential charity watchdog organizations, has given the charity a \"zero\" out of four stars for those same four years. \"It's a zero-star organization and you can't go lower than that,\" says Michael Thatcher, Charity Navigator's CEO. \"They don't have an independent board of directors, they actually don't even have a comprehensive board of directors -- only three members on the board at this point in time and some of them are family. So one can say, is this representative of an independent board? It's not.\" The charity's most recently filed tax return, for 2014, lists a catalogue of expenses paid for by donations: including $133,000 for travel, $21,000 for unnamed \"awards\", $70,000 for a category described as \"other expenses\" and even a little more than $8,000 for parking.", "Marijuana has long been touted for being virtually side-effect free. Now, according to one new study, long-term marijuana use may have one negative caveat: gum disease. After analyzing about 1,000 cannabis users in New Zealand, researchers found that those who smoked pot for 20 or more years had few health problems \u2014 with the exception of gum disease. Lead researcher Madeline Meier, an assistant professor of psychology at Arizona State University, said of the findings, Unlike tobacco smoking, cannabis smoking is associated with few physical health problems in midlife, with the exception of periodontal disease... Our analyses show that this association was not explained by tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse or less tooth brushing and flossing. While the study doesn\u2019t prove cannabis can cause gum disease, it does shed some light on the pros and cons that come with regular use, specifically smoking. A co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Duke University, Avshalom Caspi, said, What we\u2019re seeing is that cannabis may be harmful in some respects, but possibly not in every way. We need to recognize that heavy recreational cannabis use does have some adverse consequences, but overall damage to physical health is not apparent in this study. While smoking weed every day for multiple decades surely has some negative side effects, using alternative methods like vaporizers and edibles could potentially mitigate some of those consequences.

She explained why in an eye-opening caption. \"I took this picture because initially I thought it was funny,\" the mom wrote. \"I was going to send it to my husband to show what our mischievous little three-year-old was up to. However, the moment she told me what she was doing I broke down.\" \"She was practicing for a lockdown drill at her preschool and what you should do if you are stuck in a bathroom,\" Feeley explained. \"At that moment all innocence of what I thought my three-year-old possessed was gone.\" The mom implored politicians to \"take a look\" at her photo. \"This is your child, your children, your grandchildren, your great grandchildren and future generations to come,\" she wrote. \"They will live their lives and grow up in this world based on your decisions.

But maybe, just maybe, it helps 1% or 2% or 50%? Who knows unless we try?\" she wrote. From evoking the United States Constitution as a \"living document\" to asking about the NRA's role to mentioning mental health, Feeley makes it clear she will have whatever conversation it takes to impel political leaders to action. She writes, \"I applaud politicians like Senator Chris Murphy, but so many of our elected politicians can't manage to work together (maybe they shouldn't be paid for a job they can't do ... just saying) or since they are in bed with all the wrong people, it is up to us if we want change.\" To that end, the mom asks, \"Can I help?\" Addressing \"entrepreneurs,\" \"innovators,\" \"incubators\" and \"investors,\" Feeley writes, \"Can I help?

Let friends in your social network know what you are reading about Pokemon trainers flocked from around the Bay Area to attend San Francisco's Pokemon Go Crawl where they met fellow trainers and talked Pokemon over discounted themed drinks. Nick Johnson is the first person to announce he has collected every Poke\u0301mon in the popular mobile game Poke\u0301mon Go. That is, all 142 virtual monsters that users have confirmed seeing in the wild of North America. So now what? Off on an international trip to catch the Poke\u0301mon elsewhere in the world \u2014 underwritten by an international travel company. Marriott Rewards has offered to sponsor Johnson to go to Europe, Japan and Australia to catch the regionally based Poke\u0301mon and finish his collection, he told USA TODAY Friday. A Marriott spokesman confirmed the trip. \u200bUsing GPS and augmented reality, the game developed by Niantic Labs invites players to catch the colorful Poke\u0301mon monsters best known from Nintendo games and trading cards of the 1990s. In the game, the monsters appear on real-life sidewalks and park benches when a player has the app open \u2014 a scenario that's encouraged a mass public-walking binge by millions. \"I feel great,\" Johnson said. \"I was getting a lot of rest and exercise and meeting new people. I\u2019m a lot healthier \u2014 I think I lost about 8-10 pounds.\" Launched in early July , the hardcore users are now looking for the rare Poke\u0301mon. Mr. Mime , Farfetch'd and Kangaskhan are reportedly only available in the wild in Europe, Asia and Australiasia, respectively. However, it is rumored these Pokemon can be hatched from rare eggs in North America that users can pick up at PokeStops. \"I\u2019ve talked to dozens and dozens of people who have hatched 100's of eggs and no one can hatch or catch them (in North America) as far as I know,\" Johnson said.

Johnson's iPhone Health App stated he has walked an average of 8 miles per day since the game was released on July 6th. Johnson said that he had a couple of nights, when he got around the 135 Poke\u0301mon mark, that kept him out till 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. This trainer's solution: heavy doses of black tea in the morning. Even so, he said he doesn't feel like the game affected his professional life, stating that Poke\u0301mon Go is a gaming platform and he works for a platform innovation company, so he felt like the game translated back into the work he did everyday. He's even recently co-authored a book about the platform business model. He said his passion for platforms like these are a big part of what motivated him to play the game as much as he did. Beside growing up playing the Poke\u0301mon games, of course. But staying out till 5 a.m. isn't what Johnson considers to be the most drastic measure he took for Poke\u0301mon, citing a story of trying to catch a Porygon. He said when he noticed there was one close-by, he went to search for it, but the Poke\u0301mon Go radar was down so he had to order an Uber drive to drive him around until he eventually found it. \"That is above and beyond anything else I did to catch one,\" Johnson said. \"I was close to the end so it was extra motivation.\" As for other fellow trainers hoping to catch them all, his first piece of advice is to talk to trainers for tips on where to find certain Poke\u0301mon. \"I probably wouldn\u2019t be here, having caught them all, if I hadn't got those great tips like the Dratinis in Jersey City,\" Johnson said. Secondly, always make sure you walk in a straight line when trying to hatch an egg because the game uses a distance displacement calculation so walking in circles or zigzags won't do you any good. \"I learned that the hard way,\" Johnson said. For now, he's playing casually as something fun to do with his girlfriend and friends but is pouring his energy back into Applico. At least for now until he takes his international Poke\u0301mon catching trip. \"My childhood dreams of being a Poke\u0301mon master have come true.\"", "Life expectancy in the United States ranks 26th out of the 36 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), according to a new report from the organization.

Comparatively, life expectancy is 81.1 years in the United Kingdom and 82.8 years in Switzerland (the country that came in first in the ranking). The Russian Federation came in last, with a life expectancy of 69.8 years. In the 1960, the U.S. average life expectancy was 1.5 years above the OECD average. While this doesn't mean that life expectancy is decreasing in the United States -- The Washington Post pointed out that life expectancy is eight years longer now than it was in 1970 -- growth in life expectancy is not as fast as in other countries. \"In the United States, life expectancy at birth increased by almost nine years between 1960 and 2011, but this is less than the increase of over 15 years in Japan and over 11 years on average in OECD countries,\" according to the OECD.

If they're abandoning Abercrombie & Fitch, that could only spell more trouble for the company. A few years ago, tourists were a big component to the company's success. The Wall Street Journal highlighted why, exactly, tourists would wait in line to enter New York City's flagship store. Reuters/Benoit Tessier Shoppers hold bags with clothing purchases on the opening day of operations by retailers Abercrombie & Fitch outside their Paris store on the Champs Elysees May 19, 2011. Beder is not convinced that the company is making a total comeback just yet. \"That said, we have seen the Street continue to accept virtually any level of mediocrity from the company as a 'come back;' we are not convinced, and remain on the sidelines,\" he wrote. retailer got the lowest score out of all specialty retailers on the American Consumer Satisfaction Index 's ranking. Abercrombie & Fitch has been working to repair its reputation to get people in the United States to love the brand again, but the brand faces steep opposition. Earlier this year, the \"I t was a reality check for us that we have a long way to go to really elevate the experience to be best in class,\" Chairman Arthur Martinez told Business Insider in March. But he said that \"when that survey is done again, we'll be much further up the charts.\" Dan Martensen/Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch brought in Neelam Gill for campaign last fall. Last quarter, the company posted its first positive quarter since 2012 \u2014 but it was largely thanks to Hollister, the company's better-performing younger surfer brother Beder believes that Hollister is still the brand that's leading the way. \"Expect Hollister to be the most advanced of the chains, while Abercrombie still remains very much a work in progress,\" Beder writes. \"We believe their still remains material work to do in terms of offering the right mix of fashion and logo product and finding the right pricing mix; we remain wary that the company has the right mix to register better returns and margins in the near term.\" The company releases its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 on Thursday.", "Saunas are hot -- a hot home trend that is.

At least in Pennsylvania. The state legislature there recently extended its 6 percent sales tax to digital downloads and subscription services like Netflix and Hulu. Though it's called the Netflix tax, colloquially at least, the fee will also apply to streaming and downloads for music, e-books and apps. Digital versions of newspapers, magazines and the Bible, will be exempt. Pennsylvania joins a select group of locations that have begun to put local taxes on digital services. Chicago already has a similar 9-percent tax, often called its \"cloud tax.\" Digital goods are also taxable in Minnesota. Similar taxes have come up in Canada. Netflix even battled in Kentucky over telecommunications taxes there, a way some states have tried to tax digital services without imposing a sales tax. The sales taxes, like the one in Pennsylvania, are applied when a customer uses a billing address in a city or state with an applicable sales tax. So if you want to avoid the Netflix tax, borrow a billing address outside the state. At least until the Netflix tax comes for us all, that is. Pennsylvania is taxing netflix spotify and apple music.

It looks for all the world like it is doomed. But as it nears the surface, the motors burn stronger and the rocket slows considerably, landing legs spring from its sides and, as the billowing smoke disperses, it's clear it has touched down upright \u2013 and in one piece. It's a feat that was inconceivable only a decade ago. But after many spectacular failed attempts the Californian rocket maker SpaceX has in the last four months landed an orbital rocket stage four times \u2013 once on land in December 2015 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and in April for the first time on a remote-controlled barge in the mid-Atlantic. And these were not dummy rockets: both were the 40-metre-high first stages of Falcon 9 rockets that had just launched commercial spacecraft into orbit. By returning rocket stages to Earth for reconditioning and reuse, SpaceX's founder, billionaire Elon Musk, hopes eventually to make spaceflight as economical as commercial aviation. His point: airlines don't throw away a Boeing 747 after every flight, so why do it with spaceships? Sci-fi has predicted reusable spacecraft for a century or more, and space engineers have experimented with the idea since the mid-20th Century \u2013 the partially reusable Space Shuttle is arguably the closest we\u2019ve got. So why has reusability taken so long to be seriously considered? First, it\u2019s worth highlighting that SpaceX is not alone. Blue Origin, backed by Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, has launched and then landed its New Shepard suborbital space tourism rocket three times, each time venturing just beyond the edge of space, an altitude of 100km (61 miles). And Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo will also fly on multiple suborbital trips. \"Smaller vehicles which employ modern technologies can be much more reusable than the shuttle, and suborbital vehicles even more so,\" says Virgin CEO George Whitesides. But SpaceX's landings are the greater technical feat. Getting a satellite to low Earth orbit means the rocket needs to be travelling at around 6,000 km/h (3,726mph), and to reach geostationary orbit 9,000 km/h (5,590mph) \u2013 before that first stage can be released and return to Earth. \"Suborbital vehicles fly straight up and return directly down,\" says Laetitia Garriott de Cayeux, an American space entrepreneur. \"While that's difficult, the velocity at the top is zero before gravity pulls them back towards the Earth. So sub-orbital reusability is far from being as difficult as orbital reusability,\" she says. So a short explanation for why reusable rockets haven\u2019t arrived earlier is simply the technical difficulty. However, the idea of reusable spaceplanes dates back to before World War Two. Before the Apollo programme, spaceplanes were thought to be the future of reusable spacecraft, says Roger Launius at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air & Space Museum in Washington DC. \"The idea has been out there since the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon science fiction comic strips in the 1920s and 1930s. Every single one of the spacecraft in those strips was a reusable spaceplane. So since before World War Two we always thought spaceflight would be like airplane activity.\" After 1945, captured German rocket scientists revealed they had planned \u2013 but never built \u2013 a suborbital spaceplane, the Silverbird, with which the Nazis had hoped to bomb the US. A novel design feature was that it was shaped like a wing, so its shape helped add aerodynamic lift. This 'lifting body' idea was harnessed by the US Air Force in 1958 when it started work on a reusable winged spaceplane, the X-20 Dyna-Soar \u2013 but the Moon program saw that canned in 1963. After the triumph of Apollo, Nasa went straight back to its reusable first love: the winged, reusable spaceplane \"The reusable spaceplane was thrown out of the window because of the space race, which was all about beating the Russians. At the time, the spaceplane was not sufficiently advanced technology for Moonshots \u2013 but the research and testing on ballistic capsules had already been done on ICBMs,\" Launius says. \"The reentry capsules they used for a nuclear warhead are basically the same as those you put an astronaut in. You just change the payload.\" After the triumph of Apollo, however, Nasa went straight back to its reusable first love: the winged, reusable spaceplane called the Space Shuttle. Five shuttle orbiters averaged 27 missions each; the star of the fleet was Discovery, with 39 missions. \"So spaceplanes have a long history of reusability,\" says Mark Sirangelo, head of SNC Space Systems at Sierra Nevada Corporation in Sparks, Nevada. The downside was that they had to be refurbished between launches \u2013 something that applies to SpaceX\u2019s rockets too. While SpaceX has tested whether their rockets can return to Earth, it has yet to refly one. And that is the true test, says Launius. \"If you can reuse any part of a space vehicle you are going to save money on the next launch. But if they have to tear it apart and completely refurbish it every flight you might as well build a new one.\" Nasa also persevered with research on a raft of much smaller reusable spaceplanes that are now appearing in other guises. For instance, Nasa's X37 is now used by the US Air Force in the form of the X37B, an unmanned, rocket-launched spaceplane that performs extended secret military missions in low Earth orbit and which then flies home autonomously. And Nasa's HL-20 spaceplane, developed in the late 1980s and 1990s as a potential space station lifeboat, is what has been acquired by Sirangelo's Sierra Nevada Corp and renamed Dream Chaser. SNC is converting the Nasa design into what Sirangelo calls the \"strongest reusable vehicle\" they can make. That has involved swapping out Nasa's metal alloy fuselage for an advanced lightweight composite one.\" It will be significantly stronger and more capable of handling spaceflight stresses, pressures and temperatures,\" says Sirangelo. In addition to Nasa cargo flights, Dream Chaser \u2013 which can be launched on any modern rocket and land at any airport capable of receiving an Airbus A320 \u2013 is being considered by Esa and the German lab DLR for a variety of missions. These could include one to intercept and remove space debris, for instance. Some truly bizarre designs have been suggested to boost reusability While the spaceplane looks like being the most logical way to create a reuseable spacecraft, other more outlandish designs also saw the light. Take the Rotary Rocket Company's 'Roton', a pepperpot-shaped capsule tested in 1999 to avoid a problem that has dogged the hundreds of crew capsules that have returned to Earth since the space race began: they cannot land where they want to and are at the mercy of where parachutes carry them. Rotary Rocket wanted to give a crew the chance to choose where their capsule would make a soft landing, leaving the vehicle more likely to be reusable. To do this, it would re-enter the atmosphere and once in thicker air deploy helicopter rotors embedded in its surface. Driven by rocket motors on the rotor tips they would deploy at a suitable altitude and the crew would navigate, helicopter style to a landing point of their choice: watch the Roton's atmospheric test vehicle below, with smoke and unburned fuel pouring out of the rotor rockets. Unfortunately, the Rotary Rocket Company ran out of cash before their ship got very far. Nasa also once considered rotors, though not rocket driven ones, preferring sycamore-leaf-style autorotation \u2013 for its Orion capsule. The Roton\u2019s unconventional approach may partly live on, however, thanks to SpaceX . The seven-seat Dragon V2 crew capsule it's building for Nasa trips to the ISS aims ultimately to be reusable thanks to the eight rocket motors built into its exterior walls. These have two jobs: blasting the crew capsule clear if the rocket carrying it explodes during launch, and firing to provide a soft propulsive landing. Nasa's initial Dragon V2 landings will be conventional parachute drops into the ocean, with propulsive landings following. American rocket firm United Launch Alliance \u2013 a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed-Martin \u2013 is investigating how to jettison the large, expensive rocket motor at the base of its future Vulcan rocket and have it fly, on a parafoil, for a mid-air recovery snatch by an aircraft \u2013 the same way camera film canisters from spy satellites used to be recovered. ULA is also imagining a second stage that stays in orbit, waiting to be refueled for various tasks, such as satellite servicing. There are many generations of reusable space vehicles to come \u2013 George Whitesides In France, Airbus is investigating how the rocket motor at the base of the future Ariane 6 rocket could use wings and small jet engines \u2013 so it can fly back autonomously to an airport. And the Chinese Space Agency says it is planning reuse of its Long March rocket stages using multiple parachutes. It all makes sense, says Whitesides. \"There are many generations of reusable space vehicles to come. The pioneers like SpaceshipOne, Falcon9, New Shepard and the US Air Force X-37B will have descendants in many different forms, and they hold the promise of radically lower cost to orbit.\"", "You may have noticed that drinking alcohol can sometimes make your poop habits a little...shitty. If alcohol doesn't mess with your poops at all, consider yourself lucky. Maybe it happens while you're drinking, and you end up trapped in a bar bathroom praying for mercy. You know it's bad when you actually have to sit down on those gross toilets. ...or you spend the entire morning after on the toilet. Either way, alcohol poops are no fun. To get to the bottom of this, BuzzFeed Health reached out to two experts: Dr. Lisa Ganjhu, gastroenterologist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City, and Dr. Ali Keshavarzian, director of digestive diseases at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and grantee of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). So, here's why booze can be a literal shitshow sometimes: First, let's go over how alcohol is actually processed through your digestive system. When alcohol hits the stomach, a little bit is absorbed through the stomach lining. The rest ends up sloshing around in your stomach before it goes to the small intestine. In the small intestine, alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream. What's left after that is waste products and water, which moves through the large intestine (colon) until it reaches the rectum, and leaves the body...as poop. Along this magical journey, alcohol can screw with everything from your stomach enzymes to the speed of digestion, all of which can wreak havoc on your poops. Alcohol can ~speed things along~ in your intestinal tract, which is you why you might have diarrhea after drinking. The muscles of the colon contract and relax to push waste out of the body, explains Ganjhu, and alcohol can speed up those contractions. \"The increased transit time means there's less time for absorption of water in the colon, so the stools are watery and come out as diarrhea,\" says Keshavarzian. Rapid colon movements also make you feel like you need to go immediately, which explains why you sometimes need to sprint to the bar bathroom. But you're also drinking way more fluids than normal, which can loosen and liquify your stools. You consume way more liquid than normal in a night of drinking, especially if you're alternating your drinks with water \u2014 which you should. Most of the liquids end up in your bladder or they get reabsorbed in the colon, but sometimes the excess fluids end up in your stool instead, Ganjhu says. And we all know that watery, loose stool is also harder to control, so things can get a little ~explosive~. Your post-party poop problems might also be tied to certain types of alcohol or mixers. Some people have intolerances or allergies to the non-alcoholic compounds in alcohol, like the gluten from wheat in beer or the grape in wine. \"Many people have a reaction to the tanins from grape skins in red wine, which can cause nausea and diarrhea,\" says Keshavarzian. All those sugary sodas and juices mixed in cocktails can wreck your stomach, too. Drinks that are high in sugar can cause rapid gastric emptying, says Keshavarzian, where the contents of your stomach move too fast into the small intestine (cue diarrhea). And let's not rule out drunk food, either... And if you already have bowel issues or an intestinal disease like IBS, alcohol can be even worse on your gut. Doctors typically advise laying off alcohol if you have a very sensitive stomach or an intestinal disease like IBS or ulcerative colitis, says Ganjhu. Not only can alcohol worsen symptoms like diarrhea, but they can also cause additional irritation or inflammation. \"People with these diseases simply can't tolerate alcohol in the digestive tract as well as other people can,\" says Keshavarzian. On the other hand, intestinal disease could actually be the underlying problem. If you tend to have a lot of stomach or poop issues from drinking, you should visit your doctor to make sure you don't have an undiagnosed intestinal disease. But it's not just drunk poops you have to worry about. Sometimes alcohol can have the opposite effect. Alcohol can be dehydrating because it prevents your body from reabsorbing water, and at the same time you're losing more fluids through frequent urination. So if you're not drinking plenty of water with your alcohol, you can become dehydrated, which causes your poops to be harder and move slower, says Ganjhu. Translation: You're bloated and constipated. It also depends how much alcohol you drink. Interestingly enough, drinking higher amounts of alcohol doesn't always translate into more explosive diarrhea. Studies have shown that low amounts of alcohol can speed up the emptying of stomach contents into the intestines. But high amounts of alcohol can actually slow down the stomach's motility, which is more likely to cause bloating or feelings of constipation, says Ganjhu. Having food in your stomach might help reduce alcohol's effect on the intestines. Food helps to decrease the absorption of alcohol by slowing down the process of gastric emptying, says Ganjhu, when the contents of the stomach are dumped into the small intestine. That might make you feel a little bloated, but in general food will have a protective effect. Plus, you won't get hammered as fast. Drinking on an empty stomach on the other hand means more alcohol goes to the small intestine and gets absorbed into the blood so it can affect other organs like the colon, causing loose stools and diarrhea.", "When Molly Draper found out her 10-year-old daughter, Lena, messaged the local police department on Facebook requesting help with her math homework, she couldn\u2019t believe it.

Lena sent a message to the Marion, Ohio, Police Department\u2019s Facebook page last week, explaining that she was having trouble with her fifth-grade math assignment. Instead of turning her away, Draper says Marion Police Dept. Lt. B.J. Gruber, the officer who runs the page, simply responded, \"Ok with what?\" The 10-year-old began to list some math problems, \"Well I don\u2019t understand (8+29)x15.\" \"Do the numbers in the parenthesis first so in essence it would be 37 x 15,\" the officer responded. The little girl then asked the officer another difficult question. \"Ok now if I had this (90+27) + (29+15) x 2. Which one would I do first?\" \"Take the answer from the first parenthesis plus the answer from the second parenthesis and multiply that answer times two,\" Gruber explained. \"Work left to right doing the work inside the parenthesis first.\" \"I was happy, but not surprised that they responded so quickly,\" Draper told CBS News. \"They are wonderful with their communication with the community.\" Afterward, Draper posted screenshots of their exchange on Facebook, and the post went viral with more than 2,100 shares. Unfortunately, as some Facebook users pointed out, some the officer\u2019s guidance turned out to be incorrect. \"Order of operations... PEMDAS! (Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication & Division, Addition and Subtraction). For future reference,\" one Facebook user said, referring to the officer\u2019s second answer. But Gruber is hoping people will give him an \"A\" for effort. \"Hoping it is truly the thought that counts since apparently I cannot!\" he joked. \"Especially since the answer was wrong, it was very nice for Molly to acknowledge our attempt to help her daughter with some math homework.\" My daughter. Cause... She's my daughter. Thank you, Marion, Ohio Police Department, for truly building relationships with the community. Draper said she had a fun Facebook exchange with the police last summer, which is how her daughter came up with the idea to reach out to the department for homework help. \"She told me just after she did it, and I didn\u2019t believe it until I saw it,\" Draper said. That may have been the first time her daughter was in touch with the officer, but it won\u2019t be the last. \"Tomorrow he\u2019ll be joining my daughter for lunch at school, and is bringing her an autographed shirt to commemorate their going viral,\" Draper said. \"I am surprised, I thought it was just a goofy life moment to share with some friends, but it seems to really be striking a chord with people.\"", "Evanna Lynch (aka Luna Lovegood) just discovered her patronus and she is NOT amused Evanna Lynch (aka Luna Lovegood) just discovered her patronus and she is NOT amused More Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you MUST be aware that Pottermore recently released a quiz to tell you what kind of patronus you would cast based on your personality.

Guess Who Was? Enlarge this image toggle caption Leiff Josefsen/AP Leiff Josefsen/AP I was in Luxembourg recently, in advance of the British referendum on leaving the European Union, and received a tour, a history lesson and practically a sermon on the merits of the European Union by Heinz-Hermann Elting. Elting is a German-born resident of Luxembourg City. He's retired now and rides his bicycle around the city when he isn't caring for his sheep \u2014 that's singular \"sheep.\" He used to work for the European Parliament, a movable legislative feast that spends a part of the year in Luxembourg. His fervor for European integration is passionate and his knowledge of its institutions is encyclopedic. So when I observed that the United Kingdom would be the first country to leave the European Union, he corrected me. \"Great Britain is not the first case,\" he said. So who was? Greenland. Here's the story. Greenlanders didn't want to join the European Economic Community, as the EU's forerunner was called. But Greenland was part of Denmark, and the Danes outvoted them in 1973 and joined the EEC. Six years later, Greenland won autonomy from Copenhagen. Greenland then held its own referendum on European membership in 1982. More than 12,000 Greenlanders voted to leave, versus just over 11,000 who voted to remain. So Greenland began exiting the EEC, though the process wasn't instantaneous. \"I remember that we did in the Legal Affairs Committee a report on the exit conditions of Greenland,\" Elting recalled. How long did it take? \"At least two years,\" he said. Greenland officially divorced from the EEC in 1985. There are actually a couple of other cases, including French Algeria. The Mediterranean coast of Algeria was considered an integral part of France and became part of the EEC along with France in 1957. However, after Algeria received independence from France in 1962, it left the EEC. Greenland, with a current population of around 56,000, does stand out by leaving the European grouping while remaining part of a country \u2014 Denmark \u2014 that has stayed in. Greenland's leaders have said consistently that they are satisfied with the decision to leave. In a 2013 interview with the BBC, then-Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist said, \"We have regular meetings with the [European] Parliament, and the European Union is one of our international partners \u2014 an important partner, and important for trade.\" \"But,\" he added, \"at the moment, there's no serious consideration for rejoining the European Union.\" To be fair to all those who say Britain would be the first country to leave the EU, that is technically true. Greenland was not, and is not, fully independent. And the European Economic Community did not become the European Union until 1993.", "Ten years ago, Tobey Maguire was an A-list star with an Oscar-winning movie and a record-breaking superhero franchise to his name. Nowadays, you pretty much never hear about him. Let's go beyond the 25th Hour and Seabiscuit to see what Maguire has been up to lately. Spider-Man 3 kind of ruined everything The Spider-Man franchise made Tobey Maguire a superstar. It also stunted his career. Well, one of the movies did, anyway. By the time Spider-Man 3 rolled into theaters in 2007, Maguire was riding high off the film's predecessor, which did insanely well among critics and at the box office - to this day, Spider-Man 2 is considered one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. Spider-Man 3 failing to follow in its footsteps was inevitable - and making a better movie felt almost impossible at the time. Still, nobody was quite prepared for just how bad Spider-Man 3 would ultimately be. Even director Sam Raimi admitted Spider-Man 3's shortcomings in a 2014 interview with Nerdist. \"I messed up plenty with the third Spider-Man, so people hated me for years. They still hate me for it,\" he said. \"It's a movie that just didn't work very well.\" Spider-Man 4 got cancelled After Spider-Man 3, Raimi and his team aimed to correct all mistakes by making a fourth Spider-Man movie. Unfortunately, Sony scrapped the project. Supposedly. Raimi couldn't get a script done on their timeline. Instead, Sony would pursue a reboot of the franchise, which inevitably became 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man starring Andrew Garfield. Back then, the decision made sense - it had been three long years since Spider-Man 3 hit theaters, and Maguire was already pushing 35. Raimi told Vulture: \"I was very unhappy with Spider-Man 3, and I wanted to make Spider-Man 4 to end on a very high note. But I couldn't get the script together in time, due to my own failings, and I said to Sony, 'I don't want to make a movie that is less than great, so I think we shouldn't make this picture. Go ahead with your reboot, which you've been planning anyway.'\" We still wish the Evil Dead director could've done Spider-Man 4. His boyish charm stopped working Tobey Maguire has a rather young look to his face, and an even softer voice, all of which worked so well when he first became a star in movies like The Cider House Rules and the aforementioned Spider-Man franchise. As he got older, Maguire never quite aged out of his boyish charm, making it difficult for audiences to connect with him as he began to take on more mature roles. One needn't look further than Baz Luhrmann's remake of The Great Gatsby in 2013. He basically looked like he was playing a slightly older version of his character from The Cider House Rules. Ironically, it's the exact same problem Maguire's close friend and Great Gatsby co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio, managed to overcome in the late '00s by taking on grittier roles. If he hasn't already, he might want to give Leo a call. He's been busy producing movies Perhaps Maguire could read the writing on the wall - or perhaps he was just itching to do something else. Whatever the reason, Maguire has spent a good chunk of the last few years behind the camera producing films through his production company, Material Pictures. Maguire's career as a producer hasn't exactly been all that great. In two specific cases, Maguire has been linked to high-profile projects that strangely never materialized: an adaptation of Tokyo Suckerpunch, which supposedly had Anne Hathaway and Seabiscuit director Gary Ross attached - and the comic-book adaptation Afterburn, which piqued the interest of Gerard Butler and, at one point, director Antoine Fuqua. The films co-produced by Maguire that actually made it to the screen haven't done well. Among the worst: Rock of Ages, which made $38.5 million of a $75 million budget - Pawn Sacrifice, which pulled a mere $2.4 million in 2015 - and the 2016 thriller The 5th Wave, which climbed to $33.1 million. It's definitely time to call Leo. His penchant for gambling got him a lot of bad press He's a dad now Having said all of this, one has to remember that we're no longer living in 2001. In other words, Maguire is now 40 years old, married, and has two kids. There's a distinct chance that he might have bowed out of Hollywood to relax a bit and be a family man with the leftover money he earned throughout his career. That certainly wouldn't be unheard of for a celebrity who spent around six years headlining one of the biggest movie franchises in the world. It may also explain his decision to star in IFC's unique TV miniseries, The Spoils of Babylon, which became an unexpected hit in 2014. He just doesn't have to care that much anymore. Spider-Man 3's Emo Parker would be so proud.", "Let\u2019s settle this, once and for all: Clickbaiting is the intentional act of over-promising or otherwise misrepresenting \u2014 in a headline, on social media, in an image, or some combination \u2014 what you\u2019re going to find when you read a story on the web. Currently, clickbait is often characterized by wording like, \"You won\u2019t believe\" or \"What happened next will shock you,\" or other unverifiable assertions in a desperate attempt to spark your curiosity into a click. Publishers who practice clickbait social strategy the most reliably are often viral mills like Distractify and ViralNova. (ClickHole is a fun example because it parodies clickbait so effectively that its headlines still work as clickbait.) At its worst, this strategy indicates that the publisher is at a loss for how to sell audiences on a story (perhaps due to having sub par content to begin with). Sometimes you\u2019ll find these headlines on social media or on traffic-generating widgets like Taboola, click on them and find yourself with an unoriginal story that just repeats (or even distorts) facts from another site that reported the story first. If you\u2019re really lucky, you\u2019ll get to click through multiple pages before you realize how lame the story really is. Why do publishers do it? Two words: page views. Most sites use traffic numbers like page views or unique visitors to bill advertisers and measure their general success. Being a news site isn\u2019t easy, business-wise. Most publishers are guilty of using clickbait to promote stories because when it comes down to it, you still click. Readers will take the bait and the publisher is rewarded with a page view. Anyone who\u2019s trying to distribute information online is at the mercy of the big companies like Facebook and Google that help people discover their content. Publishers are constantly challenged by changing algorithms and the task of reframing and optimizing stories for social distribution \u2014 which is why the formula for clickbait might change, but the existence of sensationalistic, attention-grabbing headlines never quite goes away. For publishers, there\u2019s an extremely delicate balance when it comes to having great content and great framing, and staying on-brand is even more important. Having a site that\u2019s discoverable on social media, loads quickly, includes engaging photos and videos, is easy to navigate, leaves you having learned something new, doesn\u2019t spam you with pop ups and doesn\u2019t crash your phone \u2014 pulling it all off is tough. So there\u2019s a series of trade offs at work facing anyone who\u2019s trying to make money from content in the oh-so-flawed world of online publishing. Who decides what is and isn\u2019t clickbait? While there are some terrible headlines that qualify as the worst of the worst, there\u2019s also an enormous gray area, which is one of the reasons the word gets thrown around so often, sometimes leading to heated arguments about whether or not a story is clickbait. In the tech world, Nellie Bowles has suggested that executives and investors will disparage any story that paints them in an unflattering light as \"clickbait\" \u2014 something that plenty of TechCrunch writers have experienced. Indeed, one of the authors of this post used to work with an editor who suggested that \"clickbait\" was just another word for \"writing stories that people want to read.\" Or consider BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith\u2019s assertion that his site \"doesn\u2019t do clickbait,\" a statement that may have set a media industry record for number of eyebrows raised. But in Smith\u2019s view, no matter how ridiculous or attention-grabbing a BuzzFeed headline might be, the story gives you exactly what\u2019s promised. For Smith, the key distinction lies in deception. With real clickbait, the headline might promise Paris Hilton topless, or a weird trick that will help you lose weight \u2014 and then completely fail to deliver. On the other hand, you might not like yourself for clicking on a headline about Kim Kardashian or cute pugs \u2014 but if you click, then you can\u2019t exactly claim to be disappointed when you\u2019re served a superficial, gossipy story, or a gallery of unbearably cute dog photos. Oh, and yes, some readers might also think that a story headlined, \"WTF is clickbait?\" is clickbait itself. The fact is, TechCrunch is fighting your attention along with everyone else. But hopefully after clicking, you got what you were expecting \u2014 or something even better! Why is clickbait bad? It\u2019s bad for both sides. It\u2019s obviously annoying to have your social feeds spammed by over-promising headlines that lead you to an under-delivering half-stories on domains that crash your phone. But clickbait is also one of the easiest ways for a publisher to lose their audience\u2019s trust over time. You might click at first, but if you\u2019re smart reader, you\u2019re going to become more hesitant and suspicious \u2014 and you\u2019re probably going to share a story that disappoints you. For publishers: You can\u2019t just can\u2019t use headlines as a means to an end, and overusing a clickbait social strategy implies that you don\u2019t understand your audience. One size fits all is stupid. Treat your audience like it\u2019s smart, and remember the complexities of the modern media landscape and how hard it is to build audience trust. And if you\u2019re a reader, remember that your favorite sites should treat you like you\u2019re in a long-term relationship. They should invest in you, with accurate and engaging headlines that lead to quality journalism, good use of media and a friendly UX, rather than trying to trick you into giving a single, grudging click (the Internet\u2019s equivalent of a one-night stand). As with any relationship, you shouldn\u2019t settle.", "When Simon Cowell bought his Trousdale Estates home two years ago for about $15.5 million, the property wasn't an active listing. And now, he's apparently trying to sell the home the same way -- as a pocket listing. Local agents confirmed to The Huffington Post that Cowell, Mr. X Factor, is allowing the 7,265-square-foot home to be shown to qualified buyers and is asking in the $20 million range. At the time he bought it, Cowell had just been looking for properties to rent. But when he saw this four-bedroom mid-century home in an exclusive Beverly Hills neighborhood, he made an offer. The U-shaped mansion was built in 1966 and was designed by Hal Levitt, architect to the stars. The TV show talent judge made the #10 spot on TV Guide's 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time, something that wouldn't surprise any contestants of \"America's Got Talent.\" As for where Mr. Nasty may be headed -- that's anybody's guess. Maybe to a home that's less bachelor pad and more family-friendly now that his girlfriend Lauren Silverman is expecting?", "Until recently, doctors and scientists have quietly declined to engage in the \"How to prevent a hangover\" discussion, and the reasons they have for doing so are logical. First of all, hangovers aren\u2019t killing anyone, so there\u2019s no sense of dread or looming obligation to fix the issue. Secondly, hangovers (ostensibly) keep people from over-indulging in alcohol, which is a good thing, and create a sort of intrinsic deterrent from overindulging. But in refusing to so much as poke at the issue, the absence of academic discussion of what causes (or prevents) a hangover has led to a jumble of pseudoscience, anecdotal remedies, and outright nonsense. Wanting to hang his hat on some progress on this front, Richard Stephens oat Keel University created the Alcohol Hangover Research Group, which sounds like a nickname for a fraternity, but is actually a collective of scientists and doctors working to figure this thing out. While it\u2019s still not definitively proven, it\u2019s believed that hangovers come as a result of the chemistry of the drinks. Fermentation of alcohol creates congeners that poison us. It\u2019s believed that darker liquors contain more congeners, which actually lend liquors their color, to a degree. So the notion of \"clearer drink, clearer head\" holds up...to a point. Regardless of what you imbibe, the alcohol is broken down to an acetate and the metabolites trigger sickness, sweating, and lethargy. You also suffer inflammation because your body thinks you\u2019re warding off sickness. That inflammation also can lead to those notaries headaches. These are chemical functions of metabolizing alcohol, and very little can be done to circumvent them for a pain-free morning. But if that\u2019s the case, then why do 23% of people, as found in this study, claim to never suffer hangovers? Are one in four people lying? Not likely. It\u2019s probable that those immune to the nasty morning-after effects are genetically predisposed to doing so. Studies have shown that twins have a tendency to share this trait much more than two unrelated people do. So, unfortunately, if you\u2019ve experienced a severe hangover before, you\u2019re likely not among those immune, and barring some serious genetic work, you never will be. You can take a page out of the playbook from many who suffer from lessened hangovers, though, by pacing yourself. It\u2019s been found that those who drink for long periods of time but regulate their consumption to hover around .10% suffer far less in the way of hangovers than those who get a more aggressive with their booze intake. Stephens says that the belief that hangovers get worse as you get older is a fallacy as well, stating, \"It\u2019s a very commonly held perception that we suffer worse hangovers as we get older, but there\u2019s no evidence for it. Hangovers are largely a young person\u2019s problem.\" He attributes this to older folks knowing how much to drink and how to pace, whereas younger people do not or choose not to. As those looking for a surefire cure may have feared, common sense remains the most effective weapon in fighting hangovers. Don\u2019t drink too much, and you won\u2019t get one. But that almost certainly won\u2019t stop people from crafting their own cures and theories in the hopes that hangovers are something that can be beaten. But this suggestion of an edible stinkbug helping your hangover might be an instance of a cure being worse than the disease. It COULD turn you off of drinking for a lifetime, though, which may solve the problem.", "So the other day, I was scrolling through my timeline and came across a tweet commenting on some of the trendier rappers in hip hop right now. The tweet, which I\u2019ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like Kodak Black, Migos, Young Thug, Future, Fetty Wap, and Lil Yachty are people who subsequently have low IQs. This isn\u2019t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online. I\u2019ve seen tweets before that have told me that I\u2019m stupid for listening to more Fetty Wap songs than Tupac songs in the past year. I\u2019m not a real hip hop fan, apparently. There are a couple points I want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions. First of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as I\u2019ve ever seen it. Chance the Rapper made Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape) with Lil B. Mac Miller has a song with Chief Keef on his last album, GO:OD AM. Andre 3000 dropped a lengthy verse on \"Sixteen,\" a song off of Rick Ross\u2019 God Forgives, I Don\u2019t. What haven\u2019t 2 Chainz and Thugger not been featured on this decade? Rappers with completely different styles and interpretations of hip hop are frequently working together these days. Your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper. It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has). So if a rapper like Danny Brown wants to hop on the remix for SD\u2019s \"New World Order\" (as he did), does that mean that Danny Brown has a low IQ? Or even, does SD have a low IQ for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics/themes? The answer to both questions is no. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t matter if someone\u2019s favorite rapper is Kodak Black or Kendrick Lamar\u2014it doesn\u2019t in any way reflect someone\u2019s intelligence. Now, I can\u2019t really speak on the actual IQ numbers of the people I know, but I can say with confidence that I know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren\u2019t considered lyrical rappers. My sister, who does have a gifted-level IQ, has become a big Future fan. One of my college roommates frequently listens to Migos, and he will be attending law school next fall. My girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to Flocka like none other. My favorite hip hop project of the year (if I\u2019m not considering the force that is Death Grips\u2019 Bottomless Pit a rap album, which I\u2019m not) is Lil Yachty\u2019s Lil Boat mixtape, and I just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors. And I think \"Minnesota (Remix),\" which ironically features Quavo of Migos and Young Thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs I\u2019ve heard all year. People with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to. What\u2019s wrong with putting Kodak Black\u2019s \"SKRT\" and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\" on the same playlist? In fact, there\u2019s nothing wrong with liking both Kodak Black and Kendrick Lamar. Speaking of Kendrick Lamar, I have a friend who told me once that Machine Gun Kelly was a better artist than Kendrick. Sure, I cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn\u2019t make a difference what I thought. It\u2019s never cool to make someone feel bad for what they like or love, even if the music they like might be unpopular, weird, or bad to you. It\u2019s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren\u2019t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers. There will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art. I\u2019m guilty of it as much as I\u2019m sure a lot of people are. But opinions on hip hop are subjective. It\u2019s important to be open-minded. There are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic. There\u2019s a reason Common isn\u2019t ever requested at the bar. I don\u2019t hear A Tribe Called Quest during warmups for big basketball games. How does one dance to an Immortal Technique song? Hip hop needs guys that make music with energy. Hip hop needs rappers who allow us to tune out their words and just feel their music. Hip hop fans don\u2019t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart. Smart isn\u2019t everything, and just because a song is intellectually smart, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is enjoyable to listen to. People have different tastes. A person\u2019s music taste indicates nothing conclusive about a person\u2019s brain power. So stop hating, throw on some Lil Yachty, and don\u2019t be afraid to like it.", "Students with post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely drink large amounts of alcohol than those without the condition, a new study from the University at Buffalo concludes. Students who have PTSD and abuse alcohol in turn make their condition worse, according to the study, which tracked 486 students over three years of examining their drinking habits. \"We show that alcohol use and associated problems are linked over time to an exacerbation in PTSD symptoms, and that PTSD symptoms show a similar effect on alcohol consumption,\" associate psychology professor Jennifer P. Read said in a news release. \"Each affects the other. As such, both PTSD and heavy drinking are risk factors for one another, each with implications for the other over the course of college.\" Read was the lead researcher in the study. It was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and was published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology. Read noted heavy drinking is \"related to risk for sexual assault, interpersonal violence and serious injury, any of which may trigger PTSD.\" Previous research by Read and her colleagues in 2012 showed the first year of college is when students are most at risk to abuse alcohol. \"Interventions that offer support and resources to students entering college with PTSD may help to ameliorate problem substance use, and may ultimately facilitate a stronger transition into college and beyond,\" the researchers wrote, according to Medical Daily. Read's work in 2011 showed around 9 percent of students have PTSD. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 90 percent of alcohol consumed by people under 21 is in the form of binge drinking, defined as men consuming five or more drinks in two hours or women having four or more in the same time period.", "For 31 months, the great Conor McGregor seemed all but invincible. Five top-flight opponents entered the cage with him. Before the end of the second stanza, all five had fallen to his mighty hands. Through adversity and injury, against wrestler and striker, one thing held true in the world's most chaotic sport: If McGregor put his fists to another man, that man would fall. Death. Taxes. \"The Notorious\" Conor McGregor's left hand. It's no wonder then. McGregor saw Nate Diaz as just another opponent. Diaz, in theory, was no different than any other man, which is to say he was born to be a victim of the great Conor McGregor. Just a \"fat-skinny guy\" who had failed to claim the throne McGregor sat so firmly upon. Reality intruded, as it so often does in combat sports, in the form of a punch to the face. Diaz's blows, it seemed, knocked the hubris out of McGregor, dropping him, forcing him to shoot for a confused takedown, the gazelle walking right into the lion's den to deliver swift justice. Brandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images It was there Diaz delivered the coup de grace, what Brazilians call the mata leao\u2014the lion killer. McGregor had reached for the stars but landed with a thud on the unforgiving Octagon mat. The future, once so bright, was very much in doubt And so, just five months removed from his first UFC defeat, McGregor found himself making the long walk to the cage to face Diaz again. This time, he walked first\u2014Diaz may not have held a title belt, but he was champion of this feud, already among the most memorable in UFC history. After 25 minutes, McGregor's hand was raised in victory\u2014a majority decision that drove the internet into convulsions of both anger and joy. Diaz was left to mutter a plaintive \"What the f--k?\" McGregor, gracious in victory, credited his rival with bringing out his best. \"You've got to respect Nate and the style of fighting that he brings,\" McGregor told the media during the post-fight press conference. \"How can you not?\" When the chits were counted at FightMetric, Diaz had landed 166 significant strikes; McGregor scored 164. But fights aren't scored on aggregate. They are judged round-by-round, with effective striking and grappling the defining criteria. Who really won the rematch between Diaz and McGregor? We took a look at the fight to deliver an entirely unofficial scorecard of our own. Round 1 Steve Marcus/Getty Images McGregor knew what he needed to do to beat Diaz. Benson Henderson had written the book on it. Josh Thomson and Rafael Dos Anjos had traced from the same pattern. But devising a game plan and executing it are two different things. Diaz, with his wide stance, resting heavy on his front leg to maximize his boxing game, was born to be victimized by leg kicks. He, like his brother Nick, has a seeming disdain for them, with both men choosing to eat kick after kick rather than adjust their stance or style. Diaz had proved what he could do with his height and reach advantage in the first fight. McGregor would need to utilize the only weapon in his arsenal to re-establish his dominance at distance. The problem? McGregor had thrown only a handful of muay thai-style leg kicks in his entire UFC career, depending instead on linear kicks of the kind Jon Jones popularized. In fact, he expressly eschewed the style, judging its \"flatfooted\" fighters as lacking the movement necessary to keep up with him. McGregor's chances depended on him perfectly executing a technique he had just five months to master\u2014but he came out and did it like a multiple-time veteran of the Lumpinee Boxing Stadium The first five significant strikes of the bout were all McGregor leg kicks. By the end of the round, Diaz's leg was already bruising, and his stance was compromised. By the Numbers: Round 1 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 34/58 0/0 1 Nate Diaz 25/73 0/0 0 FightMetric \"The leg kick is a huge factor in this fight,\" announcer Joe Rogan roared. \"And Conor is using it brilliantly.\" Even better, for McGregor at least, the leg kicks opened opportunities for his straight left hand. At 3:19, he dropped a befuddled Diaz to the mat with one, though replay showed clear eyes and a full heart. Gone was the headhunter from the first fight. This McGregor was patient, composed and professional. \"That's the technical difference between the two of us,\" McGregor's trainer John Kavanagh offered as his fighter took a seat in the corner. For McGregor, it was one down and four long rounds to go. Round 1 Derek Cleary 10-9 McGregor Jeff Mullen 10-9 McGregor Glenn Trowbridge 10-9 McGregor Bleacher Report 10-9 McGregor Nevada Athletic Commission Round 2 Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images \"No more free kicks,\" Diaz's corner yelled as the bell sounded to begin Round 2. Obviously listening, he attempted to check a few early, but whether they landed or were deflected, the kicks served their intended purpose: to open up Diaz for McGregor's left hand. The work, at least early in the fight, was much easier for McGregor than it had been in the initial bout. Then, McGregor landed plenty of haymakers, but only rarely were they clean, and he exhausted himself in the process. This time, the leg kicks opened the door for everything else, preventing Diaz from circling away and backing him into the cage where McGregor could tee off with his power hand. Two stunning lefts put Diaz down, though McGregor chose not to engage the Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert on the ground. \"Nate's having a hard time moving on that right leg,\" Rogan offered. \"That could be a factor in why he's falling down like this.\" By the Numbers: Round 2 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 34/70 0/0 2 Nate Diaz 37/76 0/0 0 FightMetric In the corner, Kavanagh was suddenly a believer in the power of Thai boxing, calling out, \"On the leg, on the leg.\" McGregor obliged and landed a right hand to boot, belying the notion he's a one-handed fighter. For a fighter often criticized as a headhunter in search of knockouts, McGregor maintained his focus brilliantly. Diaz came willing to him and, over and over again, was met with a left-hand counter no matter what he tried. McGregor parried everything that came his way and responded with a straight punch that was more timing than pure speed. \"He's picking him apart right now,\" play-by-play announcer Mike Goldberg said. \"It's all Conor McGregor.\" Perhaps that was Diaz's cue\u2014a check hook launched him back into the fight, and a furious combination soon followed. Rogan began selling the idea that McGregor was slowing down, though it wasn't particularly obvious based on his incredible output. The two men exchanged 71 significant strikes in the round and, for the first time, Diaz looked to be competing on even terms. \"We have ourselves a fight,\" Goldberg said. He didn't know how right he'd be. Round 2 Derek Cleary 10-9 McGregor Jeff Mullen 10-9 McGregor Glenn Trowbridge 10-9 McGregor Bleacher Report 10-9 McGregor Nevada Athletic Commission Round 3 Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images Diaz often fights with his hands down, sometimes even leaning forward to bait his opponent into a punch. His long frame and arms allow him to either avoid or absorb those blows. His own slapping right hook follows, and then the storm comes\u2014punch after punch until it feels like they will never stop raining down. McGregor's leg kicks had prevented that strategy from coming into play and, on this night at least, his left hand was quicker to launch than Diaz's right. It required a shift in tactics that came into play in the third round. Diaz covered his head with both arms and threw a few awkward kicks of his own, sometimes lifting his knee off the ground, looking to close the distance on his Irish rival instead of countering his charge. McGregor dealt with this change smoothly, sometimes landing stunning elbows when the bigger man attempted to get inside, other times resetting across the cage, causing Diaz to point and the crowd to jeer. By the Numbers: Round 3 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 26/45 0/0 0 Nate Diaz 49/87 0/2 0 FightMetric Perhaps feeling McGregor wilt, Diaz got some of his swagger back in the second half of the round, taunting McGregor, who responded with some of the \"spinning s--t\" Team Diaz despises so much. Eventually, Diaz's tactical adjustments paid off. With just under a minute left, he cornered McGregor against the cage, put the top of his head down on the short man's chin and proceeded to go to work Diaz-style. Punch after punch flowed\u2014to the body, head, arms and air. McGregor never stopped fighting. On slow-motion replay, you can even see him avoiding or mitigating many of the worst blows. But they came in waves, a force of nature, inexorable and unyielding. \"Nate Diaz,\" Goldberg said, \"is looking to finish him right now.\" It didn't seem to matter to Diaz where the punches landed. He was throwing them until someone made him stop\u2014and only the bell did that. Round 3 Derek Cleary 10-9 Diaz Jeff Mullen 10-9 Diaz Glenn Trowbridge 10-8 Diaz Bleacher Report 10-9 Diaz Nevada Athletic Commission Round 4 Isaac Brekken/Associated Press While the announcer focused on McGregor's alleged fatigue, the fight's brutality caught up with Diaz in Round 4. The blood poured, and Diaz was forced to constantly sweep it from his eyes. Worse, as his body was failing him, an intellectual challenge presented itself. He had successfully adjusted to McGregor's new game plan in the previous round. Now it was McGregor's turn to show his fight IQ. By the Numbers: Round 4 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 46/76 0/0 0 Nate Diaz 36/63 0/1 0 FightMetric After 15 minutes of relying mostly on leg kicks and left hands, McGregor let his jab fly free. Like the leg kicks, it's never been much of a weapon\u2014but he smoothly danced at a distance, firing away with the kind of lead punch he'd never needed before in a UFC fight. Some of his favored straight kicks to the body followed, and, when Diaz attempted to repeat the feat of closing distance with a heavy guard surrounding his head, McGregor dug shots into his body with vicious glee. We knew prior to this fight that McGregor was a gifted puncher and an excellent finisher. After the fourth round of this bout, we knew something else: He was capable of outsmarting his foes too. Round 4 Derek Cleary 10-9 McGregor Jeff Mullen 10-9 McGregor Glenn Trowbridge 10-9 McGregor Bleacher Report 10-9 McGregor Nevada Athletic Commission Round 5 Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images Even after Diaz spent a minute in his corner, blood dripped to the mat as he flexed his muscles at the sound of the bell. \"Look at the blood,\" Rogan said, speaking for us all. \"Good lord.\" While the judges' scorecards indicated he needed a finish to win, Diaz saw things differently. There was no sense of purpose or urgency to score a finish. Winning the round, he seemingly thought, would be enough. It wasn't. It was one of the fight's closest. Diaz attempted to push McGregor into the cage, and McGregor continued to land punches. The story was McGregor's takedown defense. Though he didn't \"dominate the clinch\" like Kavanagh claimed in the corner, McGregor more than held his own in the championship rounds. Against the cage, McGregor worked sharp elbows that left Diaz leaking blood and overhooks to avoid meeting the mat. Diaz, of course, was Diaz, managing a collar tie and some nice work. But it was mostly a stalemate\u2014and for McGregor, that was as good as a win. By the Numbers: Round 5 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 24/37 0/1 0 Nate Diaz 19/44 1/4 0 FightMetric As the round approached the halfway point, a frustrated Diaz pointed at a retreating McGregor and then turned his middle finger up to offer a rude salute. McGregor responded with a multiple-strike combination. With 10 seconds left in the fight, Diaz scored the takedown he should have been desperate for. It was too late to mean much of anything. Both men raised their arms high after the bell rang. Both deserved to soak in the applause.

Jonathan Snowden covers combat sports for Bleacher Report.", "Fast-food chains have watched their sales growth drop off a cliff Executives advance plenty of reasons for the slowdown \u2014 or, in the case of some brands, the outright decline in sales. Some blame politics , others blame the oil crash , and so on. The real reason may be a bit simpler: It's getting cheaper for Americans to eat at home. The price of food at grocery stores has actually been on the decline since the end of 2015, based on the Consumer Price Index for food at home. In fact, in July (the most recent data available), the cost of food at home declined 1.55% from the same month a year ago. On the other hand, the cost of food away from home \u2014 what you pay at restaurants \u2014 is still on the rise. In July, prices for food away from home rose 2.79% from same month last year. According to David Palmer at RBC Capital Markets, this is also a good thing for fast-food restaurants , as ingredient prices have fallen for them, lowering costs and boosting profit margins. But the drop in food prices is also hurting sales. \"Food cost relief has been a boon to restaurant-level margins in 2016, with many fast food operators generating their best gross margins since 2012,\" Palmer wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \"That said, lower food costs have historically been a constraint to industry sales and food deflation should last through at least 2Q17.\" It appears that as long as grocery bills are shrinking, Americans are going to make their burgers instead of buying them", "Vern and Nanette had six kids, but they desperately wanted another child. One night, Nanette had a distinct dream about a little girl named Emily. Though Emily was a figment of her imagination, \"I knew that she was mine.\" The couple had a hard time getting pregnant again, but just when they decided to adopt, Nanette got pregnant with her seventh child. Still, Nanette couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that little girl she envisioned so clearly. Vern and Nanette flew to the National Adoption Center in Ukraine and began searching through photos of orphaned children for hours. They immediately stopped on a black-and-white photo of a little girl with a big bow in her hair. Vern and Nanette knew: This was Emily. This was their daughter. They got the approval to adopt her. Upon returning home to the states, Vern and Nanette quickly fell in love with Emily, but they also made a startling discovery. They had no idea that Emily had a sibling who was still in Ukraine \u2014 an older sister named Elizabeth who was more like a mother to Emily, since their birth parents were out of the picture. Six months after learning of Elizabeth\u2019s existence, Vern and Nanette received a photo of her in the mail. And soon after that, they received a handwritten letter from Elizabeth herself.", "A recent and deeply-sinister guide for men on how to talk to women wearing headphones has outraged many. Here\u2019s a more honest and accurate guide An article has surfaced from the quagmire of bilge that is The Internet and it has caused, not without reason, a small tornado of outrage. Written as dating advice for \"The Modern Man\" (a misnomer if ever there were one), it promises a solution to the hot \u2018n\u2019 horny down-on-their-luck young bucks of the world who face the tedious obstacle of a woman wearing headphones, because how dare she. And no, it isn\u2019t a parody. You can read it in its full entitled glory, or stick with me as I dissect each grubby, jaw-dropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness. It\u2019s going to be quite a ride. How to Talk to a Woman Who is Wearing Headphones \"These days, many women walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphones and listening to music at the same time. Yet, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t talk to them. Of course, not all women are open to being approached because not all women are single and looking. However, if a woman wearing headphones is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend (or even a new lover), she will almost always be happy to take off her headphones to give you an opportunity to create a spark with her.\" The author, one Dan Bacon, could have saved us all a lot of bother here by answering his \"How to\" with \"Don\u2019t\". Sadly he seems to have missed some basic behavioural science here you see, the very reason I and many other women wear headphones isn\u2019t as a trivial obstacle to some throbbing hormone mountain, nor as a challenge for those blessed with an abundance of ego. It\u2019s a defence. A defence against the aural onslaught of modern life and especially the leering advances of said throbbing hormone mountains. In short, we wear them because we don\u2019t want to be talked to. It\u2019s basic physics really - we fill our ear holes to stop you from getting in. But back to Dan: What to Do to Get Her Attention 1. Stand in front of her (with 1 to 1.5 meters between you). 2. Have a relaxed, easy-going smile. 3. Is she hasn\u2019t already looked up at you, simply get her attention with a wave of your hand. Wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can\u2019t ignore it. 4. When she looks at you, smile and point to her headphones and say, \"Take off your headphones for a minute\" and pretend to be taking headphones off your head, so she fully understands. If she doesn\u2019t understand (most women will), simply gesture that you want to talk to her by briefly pointing back and forth from you to her and say, \"I want to talk to you for a minute.\" In most cases, you won\u2019t have to go to that extreme, but some girls are shy and will be hesitant to take the headphones off right away because they are feeling a lot of nervousness and excitement about what is happening. 5. Then, do what we call \"Acknowledging the Awkwardness\" by quickly mentioning something about the awkwardness of the moment (see the conversation example below), to demonstrate you understand that approaching a woman in this way isn\u2019t the most common of experiences for either party. This helps put her at ease and know that you are a cool guy who she can relax and open up to. I don\u2019t know if these five steps are a common \"thing\", but I have personally experienced this several times. At step 1 I know what you are doing and I\u2019m ignoring you, hoping the ground will open up and take one of us to the depths of somewhere Hellish, which would be more pleasant than this situation is developing to be. By step 3 I\u2019m not feeling \"excited\" and I\u2019m not feeling \"flattered\" as Dan later tells his readers I will be - I\u2019m feeling harassed. Straight up, dictionary definition harassed. By step 4 I\u2019ve learnt that you can\u2019t understand a basic body language brush-off and are therefore a direct threat to my personal safety. My brain is in fight or flight, checking for escape routes, it\u2019s trying to figure out just how aggressively you\u2019re going to react to any further action I take to extract myself from a situation entirely not of my own making and it is praying they use a flattering photo of me on the news, not that one when my front-facing camera went off accidentally that time. According to step 5, the fact you have bullied me into one of the most awkward and scary moments of my life makes you a \"cool guy\". Mr Bacon clearly has trouble spelling. It begins with a \u2018t\u2019, Dan. Here\u2019s Dan\u2019s interpretation of how the conversation goes once a man has used his infallible five-point Jedi mind trick to bludgeon a woman from her blissful state of aural security: You: [Smile in a friendly, confident manner] Hey \u2013 I know it\u2019s not normal for people to talk to someone with headphones in, but I was walking along and saw you and thought \u2013 wow, she\u2019s a cutie, I have to say hi. I\u2019m Dan, what\u2019s your name? Woman: [Usually flattered by the compliment and impressed by your confidence to approach her like that] Jessica. You: [Add in some humor] Cool...nice to meet you Jessica. I don\u2019t normally talk to girls with headphones, but your big green headphones were just calling out to me. Woman: [Most likely laughing, smiling and enjoying the interaction]. You: [Let her know that you have something to do/somewhere to go, so she understands that you\u2019re not going to stand there talking to her for 30 minutes] Anyway, so I\u2019m just out doing a bit of shopping at the moment. I\u2019m on my way to a store up the street. How\u2019s your day going so far? In his scenario, Jessica has just been waiting her whole life to be blessed with the attention of a complete stranger who mistakes hunched shoulders, darting eyes and rictus for laughing and smiling. Here\u2019s how it plays out in real life. Trust me, I\u2019ve been it, seen it and spoken to the survivors: Him: I see you don\u2019t want to be talked to but I find you physically attractive and I\u2019m making that your problem. Her: Please leave me alone. Him: F*** YOU, YOU STUCK UP B****, I DIDN\u2019T FANCY YOU ANYWAY. With \"advice\" like this out there, it\u2019s hardly any surprise, is it? These lonely men so desperately in search of conquests have been given permission, blessed with the entitlement to go forth and pluck their bounty using but five humble steps. So imagine their horror and indignation when that which has been promised doesn\u2019t want to be plucked and tells them to sling their greasy hook. Next Dan lists the five mistakes men make when approaching a woman who is wearing headphones. Sadly not one of them is to sod right off. Points 1, 4 and 5 are fairly inoffensive, generic dating guff (be confident, be engaging, be flirty), but oh boy, just try and get your noggin round points 2 and 3. 2. Allowing her to ignore him \"Headphones are a great barrier between a person and the rest of the world. That being said, if a guy wants to get a woman\u2019s attention he needs to show confidence by being determined to get her to stop listening to the music and chat to him to him. If a guy has a weak vibe or presence about him, a woman usually won\u2019t give in to his request for her to remove the headphones. Women love to test guys to see how confident they really are and a favorite test of women is to ignore a guy\u2019s attempts to converse with her and see what he will do next. Will he walk away in shame, or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident, easy-going manner? This is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her. If a guy gives up at the first sign of resistance, most women will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness as a man.\" 3. Allowing her to take control of the interaction \"No matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave, she still dreams of meeting a guy who is more confident than her. A woman doesn\u2019t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy (i.e. call the shots, boss him around), but she will if she has to. Controlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around, being arrogant or being too assertive. Instead, you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman. In other words, make her feel girly around you because you think, behave and feel (your vibe) so masculine.\" The advice here is basically \"No doesn\u2019t mean no, it means keep going until you get what you want - the screaming will stop eventually\". Because apparently that\u2019s what women want - and forms the basis for a million rape defence cases. Trust me, when we tell you to go away we aren\u2019t testing your measure as a man, we\u2019re testing how quickly your legs can carry you in an offward direction. Put Dan\u2019s advice into any other scenario for the true jaw-drop factor: \"Shopkeepers may lock their doors at night, but if you want a pint of milk, just hammer on the door until they open up. They\u2019ll be flattered.\" I appreciate the world of mating is hard but please, for the love of humanity, learn this: just because you want, doesn\u2019t mean you can have. Women are not commodities to be hunted and won, and if you have no luck finding someone to bump pink bits with, that\u2019s your problem, not our fault for not adhering to the playbook rules. It\u2019s a playbook we never signed up for and it\u2019s only a game if both teams actually know they\u2019re playing. Nowhere in his advice does Dan tell his frustrated man-babies how to handle rejection with grace, because the advice is simply not to accept it. This attitude is why I and countless other women have been been chased down the street, followed home, physically restrained, spat at, verbally abused and generally made to feel like garbage, merely for trying to exist. So when, I hear the whiny pissbabies ask, when am I allowed to approach hot single women? Simple. If a woman has her headphones in, the answer is never - and before you bleat on about \"ooh, what if there\u2019s a fire?\", she\u2019ll smell it, even through all your bulls**t. If you\u2019re in a bar or party, her flirtatious smile may be the come-on you\u2019re looking for, but be prepared to accept that you read it wrong, politely wish her a good evening and toddle back off out of her life without 20 minutes of awkward pawing, insisting she let you buy her a rohypnoltini. But how about this take up a hobby, ask your friends if they know of someone looking to date or (brace yourself for a whopper of a revelation) if you\u2019re looking for a horde of single, eligible women all looking for friendship-maybe-more in one convenient place, try a dating site. Anyway, coming soon from Dan Bacon, \u2018How To Talk To A Woman Through A Fog Of Pepper Spray\u2019. Probably.", "When Beyonce\u0301 dropped her mega-album on Dec. 13, she caught everyone off-guard -- almost everyone. In the know were all the videographers, choreographers, set designers and even fashion stylists who were involved in creating the 17 videos, and they all swore not to tell. Among the select few were Robin Basile and John Pape, the designers of Basile and Pape Bespoke Jewelry, who were called upon to create custom pieces for the videos. And they had to do it quickly. Stylist Lysa Cooper, who's worked with Beyonce\u0301 as well as Basile and Pape over the years, contacted the design duo on Sept. 18 via her assistant, \"'warning' us that it was time to get the ball rolling on some custom pieces for Beyonce\u0301's new album videos,\" Basile told HuffPost Style. They discussed a few ideas, including a \"YONCE\" necklace, and Lysa forwarded her specifications from video director Hype Williams and his team. Then came the promise: \"Of course I swore on the Bible that I would NEVER tell a soul about the project/email,\" Basile said. \"Then the assistant told me the video shoot would be in Texas on Sept. 25,\" said Basile. That meant four days to create three custom jewelry items and have them shipped to Texas. After they arrived safely... Basile and Pape waited. And waited. And waited. \"I was on edge from the first email we received from Beyonce\u0301's team to the day her visual album came out [on] Dec. 13, 2013,\" said Basile. The pieces ended up in the videos for \"Blow and \"No Angel.\" Now that the secret's out, Basile and Pape can publicize the three pieces on their website -- and sell them. The 24k gold Disco Nameplate Necklace that they made in the shape \"Yonce\" can be ordered to say any name for $1,325 with cubic zirconias or for $2,325 with diamonds. But you can't get one that says \"Yonce.\" That, Robin told us, was a one-time deal for Beyonce\u0301 only.", "The competition to win viewers is stiff among three of the biggest online movie and TV platforms: Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon.

Simpson say to defense attorney Robert Shapiro after the football star learned he was not guilty of double murder? Shapiro tells Megyn Kelly on the Fox News Channel anchor's first special, which airs on the Fox broadcast network Tuesday at 8 p.m. Simpson whispered to Shapiro: \"You had told me this would be the result from the beginning. You were right.\" The special, called \"Megyn Kelly Presents,\" has drawn attention for having Kelly's first sit-down interview with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump since the first GOP primary debate last August. Trump vehemently attacked Kelly online and in TV interviews because he was unhappy with her tough questioning as a debate moderator. But Shapiro is also a \"get,\" as they say in the TV news industry, because he has not discussed the Simpson trial with a journalist in 20 years. Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 slayings of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. Along with revealing Simpson's whispered post-verdict comment, Shapiro tells Kelly about the infamous glove that his client was asked to try on in court during the 1995 trial. According to a transcript released by Fox News, Shapiro told Kelly he knew the glove would not fit Simpson because he tried it on first. \"It was a little bit wide in my palm and a little bit long in my fingers,\" Shapiro told Kelly. \"O.J. Simpson has enormous hands and I knew that the glove would not fit him. No question about it.

The plainfin midshipman fish sound like a bunch of kazoos, and people on boats in the San Francisco Bay area have had to get used to a low humming sound at night that stops when daylight approaches. Porichthys notatus, as its scientific name is, has a specific reason for singing. The male fish use them to try to mate, while the females only grunt in response. The unusual sound has been likened to \"an orchestra full of mournful, rasping oboes,\" according to the San Francisco Gate in 2004. Researchers from Cornell University believe they have finally discovered what causes the strange melody: melatonin. Melatonin, a hormone naturally produced by plants and animals, is released at night, the Washington Post reports. In animals \u2013 like humans \u2013 that sleep a night, melatonin is believed to control the internal body clock, telling the rest of the body that it\u2019s tie to sleep. Some have even found a treatment for insomnia in taking melatonin supplements before going to bed. But how melatonin functions in vertebrates that come alive at night has been unclear. Nocturnal animals do make melatonin when night comes, meaning it doesn\u2019t put them to sleep. The new study suggests that melatonin may be more of a trigger to signal night-specific behaviors, including prompting midshipman fish to sing. \"Our results, together with those of others that also show melatonin\u2019s actions on vastly different timescales, highlight the ability of hormones in general to regulate the output of neural networks in the brain to control distinct components of behavior,\" Andrew Bass, the lead author, says. He explains that with melatonin in particular, \"one hormone can exert similar or different effects in diurnal vs. nocturnal species depending on the timescale of action, from day-night rhythms to the duration of single calls.\" The researchers tested how melatonin works by keeping the fish in total darkness and in constant light. In the dark, the fish carried out their same routine, but in the light, there was no singing. The researchers then gave the fish in the light an artificial melatonin boost and they suddenly began singing, though at irregular times. The study was published in Current Biology.", "Bitcoin. You may have heard the term. You may even know someone who has a bunch of them. But is Bitcoin just a fad that's dying out, or is it here to stay? Let's dive into a brief history of Bitcoin, the troubles it has faced, and the answer to the question on so many lips...is Bitcoin still a thing? What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a form of currency that falls under the umbrella of \"cryptocurrency.\" To keep this simple, think of Bitcoin as currency that exists primarily in cyberspace, at a specific Bitcoin address that is linked with an access key. Unlike every other form of currency, it is decentralized, meaning large banks and corporations have no control over it. Plus, Bitcoins are not produced in the same manner as dollars or euros; they are generated by people through a process known as mining, which requires software that can solve complex mathematical problems. Perhaps the biggest selling point of Bitcoin is the finite nature of the currency. There is something called Bitcoin protocol, and it stipulates that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created. That's it. So clearly, as the demand for Bitcoins increases, so, too, does their value. (It's a little like trying to move into a town or city that has outlawed new construction. The houses in that area continue to rise in value as more people want to move in.) Another huge selling point is that it is completely anonymous. Plus, Bitcoin has tiny transaction fees, it's fast, and it's transparent. Every transaction is recorded (which is why Martin Shkreli's claim about losing $15 million in Bitcoins was bogus). How Did Bitcoin Come to Exist? Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoins came into existence in 2008 after his paper Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was published. The idea was to create a low-fee electronic payment system that was free from any central authority, and easily or instantly transferrable. It wasn't until two years later that the first Bitcoins were used, and at the time they were worth less than a penny each (today, Bitcoins are valued at over $560 each, but the price fluctuates daily, and has hit a high of $1216.73). The biggest draw of Bitcoins \u2014 anonymity \u2014 meant that it became the preferred unit of currency for illegal activities on the online black market, such as the now shuttered Silk Road. However, as the price of Bitcoins rose meteorically, people who simply wanted to make money took an interest. How Do You Acquire Bitcoins? You can set up an account at Bitcoin.org in seconds. Once there, you choose a wallet, and can then get Bitcoins in a few different ways: Simply purchase them. You can set up a currency exchange with your bank, and have the Bitcoins (or pieces of a Bitcoin) deposited in your account. You can accept Bitcoins as a payment for goods or services. If you sell items online, you can ask to be paid in Bitcoins. If you freelance, you can do the same thing. It's not easy at the moment, but as more retailers and people realize the value of Bitcoins, it could become as natural as using PayPal. Mine Bitcoins. This is the hardest part. It would take a much longer article to explain it all, but just know it is not exactly a walk in the park. With the current difficulty level and requisite hardware, it will take you 1,367 years to mine just one Bitcoin! What Troubles Have Plagued Bitcoin? Aside from being associated with the sale and purchase of illegal guns, drugs, and other black market goods and services, Bitcoin has certainly had some setbacks. For starters, Bitcoin is a digital currency, and anything digital comes with hackers ready to find a weakness and exploit it. Just last week, a major Bitcoin exchange called Bitfinex was hacked, and 120,000 Bitcoins (roughly $60 million) were stolen. Back in 2014, another exchange, MtGox, was hacked and lost over 850,000 Bitcoins, valued at the time at over $620 million! Not only that, but some authorities refuse to even acknowledge that Bitcoin is a legitimate currency. Recently, a judge in Florida ruled that Bitcoin was not considered money because it \"cannot be hidden under a mattress like cash or gold bars.\" Ironically, this statement is going to have people running to use Bitcoin if they now realize they can legally launder money with it. What's more, you can actually have physical Bitcoins. You can even print them with a 3D printer. As long as they are linked to a Bitcoin address, and have an access key, they work. But for millions of people, this idea of money existing only in cyberspace is very disconcerting. So...Is Bitcoin Still a Thing? In a word, yes. Although the price of a Bitcoin is less than half what it was in 2013, the thing that makes Bitcoin a success is usage. Several years ago, few retailers were willing to touch Bitcoin as a method of payment. Now, more and more blue chip, big name companies are taking Bitcoin, and as more join the list, Bitcoin will become even more enticing. Here are just a few of the many companies now taking the cryptocurrency: Expedia NewEgg Amazon Overstock AliExpress With so many big names willing to accept Bitcoins, and the price of them rising as more people get into the market, Bitcoins are still viable and may even become more attractive to the average consumer. So, if you're interested, you may want to consider getting in sooner rather than later. After all, the person who spent 10,000 Bitcoins on two pizzas back in 2010 would have $4 million today! Are you over Bitcoin and cryptocurrency? Or are you still mining?", "The physical features on Michael Imperioli's face change when his former co-star James Gandolfini is brought up. There's certainly no sense that Imperioli doesn't want to talk about Gandolfini -- in fact, he mentioned Gandolfini's name first -- but it's obvious that speaking about the late actor is hard for former friends and colleagues. I was wary to discuss \"The Sopranos\" at all with Imperioli (who, of course, played mobster Christopher Moltisanti on David Chase's acclaimed show) out of fear that since the subject comes up so many times in his day-to-day life he may just be over it by now. This is not the case. Imperioli's eyes light up as he recounts tale after tale -- including an admission that he wasn't a huge fan of the first script. Imperioli, who I met at his lower Manhattan hotel room, is now co-starring in Spike Lee's \"Oldboy.\" He plays Chucky, a bar owner who helps his childhood friend, Joe (Josh Brolin), on a mysterious quest to find out who has imprisoned Joe for the last 20 years. The results are ... well, not really what you would expect (unless you've seen the Korean film on which \"Oldboy\" is based). Did you audition for \"Oldboy,\" or was the role offered? Spike called me -- I had worked for him a bunch of times. And he called out of the blue and had assumed that I had already gotten the offer from my agent, which I didn't. So he called and said, \"I'm really psyched we're working together again.\" And I'm like, \"What? What are we doing?\" He's like \"Oldboy! You're playing Josh Brolin's best friend.\" I said, \"Spike, I don't know what you're talking about.\" It's interesting when Spike Lee makes a kind of movie that isn't what he is most known for doing. Yeah, he is a filmmaker. Because when he started out, he was identified with being a \"black filmmaker.\" He was telling these stories and they were mostly black characters. They weren't necessarily, like, \"She's Gotta Have It,\" could be any race, it doesn't matter. Because he really was at the forefront of a new kind of generation of cinema where a lot more African Americans were going to be making films. Originally, they started calling him \"the black Woody Allen,\" and he probably hated that title. But, that's only a part of who he is ... he's a lot of things and over the years, we've seen that his filmmaking and his art encompasses all of those things. Did you watch the original movie? No. This one I haven't seen, either. I'm going to see it at the screening tonight here in New York, then I will see the original. There's something I've always wondered. On \"The Sopranos\" you were playing younger... Yeah, my character was younger than me. After \"The Sopranos\" ended, did that ever affect you for other roles? That people assumed you were younger? I think people always thought I was more of a Guido than I am. That's more the issue. They knew you were acting, right? Not necessarily. They kind of thought it was more like \"Jersey Shore\" when it came out. What? I'm not kidding! I think a lot of people thought that we were not necessarily even actors -- that they had found us in New Jersey and put us on television. I think a lot of people had that perception. Not after it had been on for awhile, right? No, no. At the beginning. That's insane. A lot of people are insane [laughs]. And then they'd meet me and they would be kind of disappointed that they weren't meeting Christopher. That's fascinating. Sad but true. Like a lot of people, I recently watched all of \"The Sopranos\" again. It was better than I even remembered it was. Obviously David Chase's vision of the whole thing, it's beyond brilliant -- and really, really creative and amazing. But, in addition to that, I think the fact that it's really funny. Like really. Like pee in your pants funny. And in an absurd, sometimes even slapstick way, which is great. But, there's this kind of magic that happened with \"The Sopranos\" because a lot of the actors, for me, I knew and had worked with most of those people. Two of the actors, John Ventimiglia and Sharon Angela -- Johnny played Artie and Sharon played Rosalie Aprile -- I was in acting school with them when I was a teenager. I had done movies with Vinnie Pastore and Tony Sirico, and I know Edie Falco, we had done some stuff together. So, in some sense, it was kind of like this generation of New York actors having this moment to do it together, like as a band. Rather than something that was cast in Hollywood and you got a bunch of good actors and made a good TV show. So, there was that other added element of magic that I think happened. You've been on television shows since then. Can you tell when that magic is missing? When I read the pilot of \"The Sopranos,\" I wasn't terribly blown away by it. I'll be honest with you. Really? Number one, I needed a job at the time. Number two, there really wasn't big shows on cable. Yeah, I thought it was a good character, it was kind of fun, but I wasn't so clear on the tone of the show. I thought it was more of a spoof of the mob. So, if you just read the pilot, you don't really get a sense of how deep he was going to go, David Chase. I knew it was good, but it wasn't something like, \"I have to do this,\" or that I was blown away by it. But then I saw some of the people who were going to do it -- like Edie and Lorraine [Bracco] and Vinnie and Tony. I didn't really know Jim [Gandolfini], I didn't know his work. But, when I saw those actors -- especially Edie, who was always one of my favorites and who I had a lot of respect for for a long time -- I was like, \"okay, that's cool.\" But it wasn't until we started shooting the first season when the other scripts started to come in -- when you saw, \"Oh, wow.\" The scripts kept getting better. So, it wasn't until we started seeing those scripts. You wrote a few episodes. How did that come about? I wrote a spec script after the first season, because I had really fallen in love with the show. Particularly with all of the characters. I wanted to get into the minds of the other characters. So, I wrote a spec script between the first and second season and gave it to David. And during that time, also, \"Summer of Sam\" came out -- I was one of the writers there -- and David saw that. So, between those two things... He's famously tough on his writers. Was he as tough on you, even though you were in the cast? Yeah, he was very tough -- tough on everybody. But, not in a bad way -- in a very good way. And I think the biggest thing I learned from that guy was the detail. Because, as a writer, his attention to detail and specifics was incredible. Nothing was ever generic; nothing was ever taken for granted. If ever a delivery boy shows up at the door with a pizza, it was always like, \"A Pakistani guy with a Brazil soccer jersey who has a limp shows up with a pizza\" -- and the guy has no lines! Everything was like that. Always. I just interviewed Alan Taylor for \"Thor: The Dark World\" about of all the death scenes he's directed... Alan Taylor directed \"Thor\"? \"The Dark World,\" yes. You didn't know that? No. I had no idea. That's pretty cool. But Christopher was his favorite death scene. You know, when I was 17 or 18, I worked on an NYU film and he did the sound on it. And when he came on \"The Sopranos,\" I recognized his face. I was like, \"You went to NYU, did you do this?\" He's like, \"Yeah, I was the sound guy.\" It's so weird. I don't have a question, but I just want to say that I met James Gandolfini randomly at a bar one night and he was nice to me when he didn't have to be and I never forgot that. Yeah, he was that kind of guy. You know, I think the thing with Jim was, my mom called and said, \"everyone is calling me,\" after Jim died. I said, \"Why is everyone calling you?\" She goes, \"Because everyone feels like they knew him.\" When someone like Michael Jackson dies, this huge mega-star that people are mad about, he always seemed like they worshiped him from afar. He was on this pedestal. Whereas with Jim, I think they all felt like he was one of them. And he was a big part of this city. He was just out and about everywhere. Another friend of mine who is an actor who lives in Tribeca said there was a big snowstorm and he looks out his window and he saw Jim shoveling some woman's car out of the snow. And he said, \"I feel kind of safe knowing that Jim Gandolfini lives in the neighborhood.\" And I understood what he means, because you would see him out and about. He's not someone who traveled with bodyguards in limousines. Have you seen \"Enough Said\"? It's very touching. No, I don't know if I'm going to see that. It's tough. I mean, I've seen some clips from it and it seemed like more than anything, that's closer to who he was than anything else I've seen him in.", "The Cumber Collective better be ready because \"Sherlock\" is back!

If Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters succeed in booting C.Y. Leung from power, the city\u2019s unelected chief executive should consider coming to the United States. He might fit in well in the Republican Party. In an interview Monday with The New York Times and other foreign newspapers, Leung explained that Beijing cannot permit the direct election of Hong Kong\u2019s leaders because doing so would empower \"the people in Hong Kong who earn less than $1,800 a month.\" Leung instead defended the current plan to have a committee of roughly 1,200 eminent citizens vet potential contenders because doing so, in the Times\u2019 words, \"would insulate candidates from popular pressure to create a welfare state, and would allow the city government to follow more business-friendly policies.\" If that sounds vaguely familiar, it should. Leung\u2019s views about the proper relationship between democracy and economic policy represent a more extreme version of the views supported by many in today\u2019s GOP. Start with Mitt Romney. In 2012, at a fundraiser with ultra-wealthy donors, the Republican nominee famously denigrated the \"47 percent\" of Americans who \"believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing\"\u2014to a welfare state. Because these self-appointed \"victims\" were voting in order to get things from government, Romney argued, their motives were inferior to the potential Romney voters who \"take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" In distinguishing between Americans whose economic independence permits them to make reasoned political choices and those who because of their poverty cannot, Romney was channeling a hoary American tradition. In 1776, John Adams argued that men (let alone women) \"who are wholly destitute of Property\" were \"too dependent upon other Men to have a Will of their own.\" In 1800, only three states allowed property-less white men to vote. For most of the 20th century, southern states imposed \"poll taxes\" that effectively barred not only African Americans from voting but some poor whites as well. Romney didn\u2019t suggest that the 47 percent be denied the right to vote, of course. But other Republicans have flirted with the idea. In 2010, Tea Party Nation President Judson Phillips observed that \"The Founding Fathers ... put certain restrictions on who gets the right to vote ... one of those was you had to be a property owner. And that makes a lot of sense, because if you\u2019re a property owner you actually have a vested stake in the community.\" In 2011, Iowa Representative Steve King made a similar observation, noting approvingly, \"There was a time in American history when you had to be a male property owner in order to vote. The reason for that was, because [the Founding Fathers] wanted the people who voted\u2014that set the public policy, that decided on the taxes and the spending\u2014to have some skin in the game. Now we have data out there that shows that 47 percent of American households don\u2019t pay taxes ... But many of them are voting. And when they vote, they vote for more government benefits.\" In 2012, Florida House candidate Ted Yoho remarked, \"I\u2019ve had some radical ideas about voting and it\u2019s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote.\" Yoho went on to win the election. Philips, King, and Yoho are outliers. Most prominent Republicans would never propose that poor people be denied the franchise. But they support policies that do just that. When GOP legislatures make it harder to vote\u2014either by restricting early voting, limiting the hours that polls remain open, requiring voter identification or disenfranchising ex-felons\u2014the press usually focuses on the disproportionate impact on racial minorities and Democrats. But the most profound impact may be on the poor. Voter-identification laws, in particular, act as new form of poll tax. After Texas passed its voter-ID law, a study found that Texans who earned less than $20,000 per year were more than 10 times more likely to lack the necessary identification than Texans who earned more than $150,000. On the surface, this discrepancy might seem possible to remedy, since courts have generally demanded that the states that require voter identification provide some form of ID for free. But there\u2019s a catch. Acquiring that free ID requires showing another form of identification\u2014and those cost money. In the states with voter-ID laws, notes a report by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School, \"Birth certificates can cost between $8 and $25. Marriage licenses, required for married women whose birth certificates include a maiden name, can cost between $8 and $20. By comparison, the notorious poll tax\u2014outlawed during the civil rights era\u2014cost $10.64 in current dollars.\" To make matters worse, roughly half a million people without access to a car live more than 10 miles from the nearest office that regularly issues IDs. And the states that require IDs, which just happen to be mostly in the south, also just happen to have some of the worst public transportation in the country. Not surprisingly, a 2007 study by researchers at Washington University and Cal Tech found that, \"registered voters with low levels of educational attainment or lower levels of income are less likely to vote the more restrictive the voter identification regime.\" Barring former felons from voting has an even more dramatic impact on the poor, since almost half of state prison inmates earned less than $10,000 in the year before their incarceration. Obviously, the United States is not Hong Kong. But there\u2019s a reason some of the city\u2019s demonstrators have adopted the label \"Occupy.\" Like the Americans who assembled in Zuccotti Park in 2011, they are fighting a system in which political exclusion and economic exclusion reinforce each other. Hong Kong\u2019s chief oligarch is named C.Y. Leung. But here in the U.S., we have ours too.", "The Canal Saint-Martin in Paris has sat peacefully full of water for the last 15-years.

Then, he noticed the writing underneath and realized that his third grader had been stamped with the words, \"I Need Lunch Money.\" Shocked at first, he didn\u2019t register the implications of the stamp. As it turns out, the elementary school that Bivens\u2019 son attends, Gardendale Elementary in Gardendale, AL, operates its cafeteria with refillable charge cards. Students who buy lunch at school swipe the card to pay for lunch. Parents keep the cards refilled by topping them up with money from time to time and are notified if the balance runs low. Bivens understood the card system, but was shocked by the method of delivery. His little boy brings a packed lunch to school almost every day and rarely needs lunch money, unless he wants to buy a special treat from the cafeteria. As a result, he almost never has to use his school lunch card and his parents decided not to top it up so close to the end of the school year. Still, Jon Bivens told The Huntsville Times that he was stunned by the way that the school had chosen to convey the message to him as a parent. He says that, in the past, the school had called or sent emails or letters to remind parents of the balance. The stamp, which he calls a \"brand,\" was typically a communication of last resort for the school. Bivens says he received no direct contact, and adds, \"When you start stamping a message on a child\u2019s body instead of calling...it\u2019s not okay.\" He also calls the stamping, \"a form of bullying.\" From his perspective as a parent, it was completely uncalled-for behavior from the school.", "After learning that their mother may only have a few months to live, three sisters decided to plan a last-minute triple wedding.

But how did people know where to go? And how did they know what they would find when they got there? Native Americans actually solved this problem hundreds of years ago, and the remnants of their brilliant methods can still be seen today. You just have to know where to look. Believe it or not, but there was a time in North America where we didn\u2019t have any roads. That\u2019s where these special trees came into play. Before the colonization of the continent by Europeans, different groups of Native Americans needed to know how to navigate without the use of roads. So, they came up with the idea of \"marker trees.\" The trees were deliberately bent and manipulated as saplings in order to help them navigate the land. They marked geographic divides and the territories of different tribes. They also marked everything from water sources to burial sites. They also marked the safe crossing points along rivers. The shapes could be different depending on the tribe or their intended meaning. Without any sort of road signs, these were essential for the peoples of North America. Typically, they\u2019re made from trees like oak, maple, and elm. Eventually, the European settlers adopted the marker trees as well. Here\u2019s a diagram of how the saplings were bent.

But if the bird is filled with stuffing, the popular side dish could easily come out undercooked, which can result in dangerous bacterial contamination. Rochelle Sirota, RD, CDN, says that stuffing and cooking the turkey could risk the spread of salmonella, a bacterium that is the common cause of foodborne illness. \"It's harder to gauge the heat inside the turkey and you can't really reach all the way inside with a thermometer,\" said Sirota. Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention receive reports of an average 42,000 cases of salmonellosis -- symptoms of salmonella poisoning that include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps -- but thousands more likely go unreported, according to the CDC website. While most people recover from salmonellosis within a few days, complications such as dehydration or an intestinal infection can be life-threatening, according to the Mayo Clinic. The bacteria is spread through contaminated surfaces, water or food. The primary sources of salmonella are undercooked poultry or eggs, although the bacterium has been linked to vegetables and ground meat. The U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests stuffing be cooked apart from the turkey, especially for cooks who don't use a meat or cooking thermometer. The USDA also advises cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, which will take more time if the bird is stuffed, according to a study from the University of Georgia. Since you have a lot less control over the stuffing when cooked in a bird, Sirota says the smartest and safest choice is to simply cook it separately and serve it as a side. But that's not the only food contamination risk: If you're cooking ahead, be mindful of how far ahead. Sirota suggests cooking the stuffing no longer than four days in advance, as cooking it any longer ahead of time could also increase the risk of bacteria growth. When cooking ahead for Thanksgiving remember to refrigerate foods within two hours of reaching room temperature.", "By Julia Rubin \"What have I become?\" 23-year-old Andrew Jones asked his mom shortly before he died. \"What's happened to me?\" A star high school athlete who went on to play Division I football for Missouri State University, Andrew was an honors student whom friends described as outgoing, charismatic, and loyal. He was also a heroin addict. Never even a recreational drug user, Andrew had been the first to discourage friends at his Catholic high school from smoking pot. But his story is frighteningly typical of the current heroin epidemic among suburban American youth. It's an issue made all the more timely by the recent heroin-related death of Glee star Cory Monteith, best known and beloved for playing squeaky-clean high school football star Finn Hudson. What Cory and Andrew expose is that heroin isn't at all what it used to be. Not only is the drug much more powerful than before (purity can be as high as 90 percent) but it's also no longer limited to the dirty-needle, back-alley experience so many of us picture. Now it's as easy as purchasing a pill, because that's what heroin has become: a powder-filled capsule known as a button, designed to be broken open and snorted, that can be purchased for just $10. And it regularly is\u2014on varsity sports teams, on Ivy League campuses, and in safe suburban neighborhoods. During his sophomore year of college, Andrew fell ill from a virus that left him with pancreas damage. Soon after that, he broke his hand. Add in routine wisdom teeth surgery, and Andrew was swimming in prescription painkillers. He became addicted. \"He would steal them, he would buy them, he would find them wherever he could,\" remembers his friend, 26-year-old Missouri native Katie Gerstenkorn. \"He stole painkillers from me, actually.\" When Andrew was given a capsule of heroin at a party, he was instantly hooked. According to Dan Duncan, associate executive director at St. Louis's National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (NCADA), most heroin users start with pain pills as Andrew did. It's no wonder: In an interview with 60 Minutes last year, National Institute on Drug Abuse director Dr. Nora Volkow dropped the eye-opening statistic that in a country of 312 million people, 210 million prescriptions for opiate medications were written in 2011 alone. But pain pills are expensive\u2014legally and on the black market\u2014pushing those dependent on them to seek out a cheaper, more easily accessible alternative with a similar kind of high: heroin. Andrew went to his parents for help. \"He couldn't get away from the drug,\" says his mom, Pam. \"It's a hunger, it's a thirst. You throw all your morals out the window.\" Before long, he was caught stealing money from his roommates so he could buy more. After a stint in rehab, an overdose, and another stint in rehab, it looked like he was finally starting to get a handle on his addiction. Like Cory Monteith, Andrew was doing his best to clean up\u2014and everyone in his life believed he could do it. Until the overdose that killed him. In 2008 Duncan and his NCADA staff started getting an influx of calls about heroin to their help line. \"It wasn't just that we were getting calls about heroin\u2014we were getting calls about heroin and teens specifically,\" he says. \"It became clear that this was a problem in some of the best high schools in the area. Public, private, most of them.\" By 2010, the year Andrew died, the number of calls about heroin had exploded. \"The thing that was most startling was the average age of the deaths from heroin overdoses,\" says St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch. \"Historically the age for most heroin deaths has been in the 40-to-45 range. But now the average age is between eighteen and 25.\" For some, heroin abuse starts even earlier. At fourteen, Emily* was a high school freshman who had just made the varsity cheerleading squad. By fifteen, she was a regular heroin user. Despite her habit, Emily was able to maintain a facade at school, getting good grades and staying out of trouble. \"It was like I was leading a double life,\" she says. \"I thought, Maybe this is my little secret, and it's not as bad as everyone says it is.\" At first, she did it only on weekends with a friend of a friend's older brother. He would provide the drug for free but quickly began pressuring her to have sex with him. Eventually she caved. \"I slept with him because I felt like he was giving something to me, so I had to give something to him,\" she admits. \"Looking back on it, my self-esteem was so low, and that's why I was doing all these things.\" Her supplier was 30 years old. Emily started skipping school, and then didn't try out for cheerleading the next year. Doing heroin became part of her daily routine. When a friend wanted to try it for her sixteenth birthday, Emily realized heroin wasn't her little secret anymore\u2014it was something other kids at her school were doing too. Over the course of two years, she entered treatment six times, overdosed on heroin twice, and ran away from home. Emily was thrown out of a hotel and a homeless shelter after that. She returned home and attended twelve-step meetings, but continued to use. Finally a switch flipped. \"I was willing to go to any length to get high, and then it became clear that I needed to go to any length to get sober. I had to change every single thing in my life, which was terrifying,\" Emily says. \"But when the pain of staying the same was greater than the pain of change, that's when I knew I really had to do something.\" In 2012 and 2013, local news reports in Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Orange County, Syracuse, and a growing number of other areas told the tales of teens dying from heroin. Cases like Andrew's are becoming more of the norm, while those of recovering addicts like Emily seem to be more of the exception. And with a year and a half of sobriety under her belt, Emily wants to expose teens to the scary prevalence of the drug that nearly killed her. She speaks at schools and treatment centers and is studying to become a nurse. \"Today I can be a part of things instead of apart from them. It's so hard to describe the pain and the misery I felt, the downward spiral,\" Emily says. \"My worst day in sobriety is so much better than even my best day getting high.\" *Name has been changed.", "Forget Mr Right and settle for Mr Alright You might think that when presented with a never-ending supply of potential suitors, people would be getting pickier.  After all, with a lot of dating websites like Match and eHarmony, users can specify almost everything they\u2019re looking for in a partner, so why wouldn\u2019t you be choosy? New research has revealed, however, that people are in fact lowering their standards as a result of dating apps and sites. Researchers from the Queensland University of Technology studied data from Australia\u2019s largest dating website RSVP and the dating profiles of over 41,000 people aged between 18 and 80 in a bid to work out whether the rise of online dating has changed people\u2019s habits. They concluded that singletons are disregarding their \u2018check-list\u2019 of criteria and pursuing other potential romantic partners who have sufficient acceptable qualities. The reason that online daters are more likely to settle could be that they\u2019re tired of trying to find the perfect person amongst so many. \"We looked at whether or not people actually contact people who match what they say is their ideal partner in their profile, and our findings show they don't. Stating a preference for what you are looking for appears to have little to no bearing on the characteristics of people you actually contact,\" study author Stephen Whyte said. He explains that the nature of online dating is triggering changed in the psychology of humans choosing a mate. \"Disclosure of 'ideal' partner preferences is a widely offered and commonly-used option for people creating a profile on online dating websites, but whether it's effective or useful in helping people find that special someone is unclear,\" Whyte says. \"This study provides quite unique findings in that people may state a preference for an ideal partner but they are more than happy to initiate contact with potential love interests that bear no resemblance whatsoever to that 'Mr or Mrs Perfect' they initially think they prefer over all others.\" In today\u2019s busy world, with our seemingly throwaway dating culture, finding a partner takes a lot of time and effort, but the study\u2019s results could be encouraging for people looking for love online. So if you lower your standards, the chances are everyone else has too, so you may just meet the one as a result.", "Bill Comeans was murdered 34 years ago when he was 14 -- and his Twitter account won't let you forget it.

There\u2019s still no cure for the common cold, for example. Our conditioner always seems to run out before our shampoo. And we still have no scientifically proven way to avoid blisters. Well, we can cross that last one off the list, at least. A study published today in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine reports a simple, cheap method for blister prevention\u2014and it\u2019s available in any drugstore. Grant Lipman is an emergency medicine doctor working with some of the blister-iest feet in the world: those of runners. \"What I kept hearing was, 'Doctor, I'd be doing so well, if only for my feet,'\" Lipman said in a press statement. \"Their feet were getting decimated.\" Military doctors told him that blisters were keeping their patients from completing basic training. The angry sores that form from repeated pressure and friction, and the infections they caused, were hobbling our armed forces. \"People have been doing studies on blister prevention for 30 or 40 years and never found anything easy that works,\" Lipman said. \"I wanted to look at this critically.\" So he and a team of his colleagues in emergency and sports medicine put their heads together and decided to test one method that patients had mentioned again and again: paper tape. Paper tape, also known as surgical tape, is a mildly sticky adhesive tape used in hospitals to cover wounds. A roll of paper tape will run you less than a dollar at your local drug store, and anyone can apply it. Lipman decided to put the tape to the ultimate test: actual ultramarathons. These extreme footraces are legendary for breaking down runners\u2019 bodies and minds . If paper tape could help runners get through an ultramarathon\u2014in this case, the seven-day, 155-mile RacingthePlanet event\u2014that would be pretty good evidence in its favor. RacingthePlanet runners literally become globetrotters, completing the race's six stages in different parts of the world. Before the event began, researchers recruited 128 runners: 19 participants from the Jordan segment, 35 from the Gobi, 21 from Madagascar, and 53 from the Atacama Desert. Each participant told study staff about their personal blister history. Medics associated with the study then applied tape to one foot on each runner. If the runner was blister-prone, the medic stuck tape in areas of previous problems. Otherwise, the location of the tape was randomly assigned to one of four blister-likely areas: the toes, instep, outstep, or heel. Then the race began. By the finish line, 109 participants (that is, 109 feet) remained in the study. On those feet, the researchers found 97 blisters\u2014but only 28 of those were located in taped areas. The cheapo paper tape had blocked blisters in 74 percent of runners. \"It's kind of a ridiculously cheap, easy method of blister prevention,\" Lipman said. \"You can get it anywhere. A little roll costs about 69 cents, and that should last a year or two.\"", "Alexandria\u2019s genesis is an online myth. It claims that a genetic mutation turns some people into \"perfect\" human beings. This is fiction, but several real medical conditions can cause changes in eye color. The myth has been traced back to 2005, though it may have been spread earlier. People with the fake condition are said to be able to live to 150, and they allegedly have: purple eyes, with the color present from birth or developing shortly after, pale skin, perfectly proportioned bodies, an absence of body hair, high levels fertility, but without menstruation in women, excellent immune systems, very little bodily waste While Alexandria\u2019s genesis is a complete fabrication, the following real conditions can change the color of the iris. Conditions that change eye color The iris is the colored ring that surrounds the eye\u2019s pupil. It controls the amount of light that enters the eye. Natural changes with age Most babies are born with brown eyes. However, many of Caucasian heritage initially have blue or gray eyes. This color may darken over time, to become green, hazel, or brown. Infants with brown eyes rarely experience changes in iris color, although the shade of brown may become more prominent. A change in iris color occurs because of a protein called melanin, which is also present in the hair and skin. Cells called melanocytes produce melanin in response to light exposure. Melanocytes become more active during the first year of life, explaining the change in an infant\u2019s eye color. Usually, changes in eye color will have stopped by the age of 6, though some people experience them throughout adolescence and adulthood. Research suggests that this phenomenon affects 10\u201315 percent of people of Caucasian heritage. Heterochromia iridis People with heterochromia iridis have eyes of different colors. Another form of the condition, called segmental heterochromia, causes color variations within the same iris. Most of the time, heterochromia occurs sporadically and is not caused by another disorder. In rare cases, it may be linked to other conditions, such as: Horner\u2019s syndrome, Parry-Romberg syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Waardenburg syndrome Fuchs\u2019 heterochromic uveitis (FHU) Also known as Fuchs\u2019 heterochromic iridocyclitis, this rare condition is characterized by long-term inflammation of the iris and other parts of the eye. FHU causes a change in eye color. The iris usually becomes lighter, though it may darken in some cases. FHU typically affects one eye, but 15 percent of people experience a change in both, according to the American Uveitis Society. Other symptoms include decreased vision and the perception of \"floaters.\" FHU may increase a person\u2019s risk of developing other eye conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Horner\u2019s syndrome Horner\u2019s syndrome, or Horner-Bernard syndrome, refers to a group of symptoms that affect one side of the face. These include: decreased pupil size, delayed opening of the pupil in dim light, a drooping eyelid, reduced sweating on one side of the face The difference in pupil size between the affected and unaffected eyes can give the appearance of different eye colors. The iris of the affected eye may also be lighter in color when the syndrome develops in babies under 1 year old. Horner\u2019s syndrome is caused by a disruption in a nerve pathway leading from the brain to one eye and side of the face. It often results from damage induced by: a spinal cord injury, a stroke, a tumor, Sometimes no underlying cause can be found. Pigmentary glaucoma Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions caused by damage to the optic nerve. This damage is often linked to abnormally high pressure in the eye. Glaucoma can lead to vision loss if left untreated. It is estimated that over 3 million Americans have glaucoma, though not all are aware of it. One type, pigmentary glaucoma, causes the pigmentation in the iris to fall away in tiny granules. These granules build up in the eye\u2019s drainage channels, preventing fluid from seeping out and increasing pressure in the eye. This may lead to abnormalities in the iris, though the color of the eyes will not completely change. Treatment involving medication, lasers, or surgery can reduce the buildup of pressure, but it is difficult to prevent the release of pigment. Tumors of the iris Tumors may grow behind or within the iris. The majority are cysts or pigmented lesions similar to moles, called nevi. Other tumors may be cancerous. Tumors in the iris usually cause no symptoms, but some people with nevi may notice changes in their eye color. Even when no other symptoms are present, if a person suspects that they have a tumor they should see a doctor, especially if a nevus: changes shape or color, becomes bigger, interferes with the pupil Treatments include radiation and surgery. Medicated eye drops Some medicated eye drops used to treat glaucoma can lead to changes in eye color. Medications known as prostaglandin analogs, such as latanoprost (Xalatan) and bimatoprost (Lumigan), can cause light-colored eyes to darken. They may also lead to other changes in the eyes\u2019 appearance. Bimatoprost can act as an eyelash enhancer, and it is marketed under the name Latisse for this purpose. When applied to the eyelashes, Latisse can encourage growth, but it may also increase brown pigmentation in the eyes. This effect is likely permanent. Latisse can cause the skin of the eyelids to darken as well, though this effect usually goes away when a person stops using the product. When to see a doctor Anyone who notices changes in the color of one or both eyes should see a doctor. Changes unrelated to color should also be investigated, as they may signal an underlying condition. A person should also seek treatment anytime they experience: reduced vision, blurriness, floating spots in the field of vision, pain, redness of the eyes, Takeaway Alexandria\u2019s genesis is a myth about the existence of \"perfect\" human beings who have purple eyes and other unrealistic attributes. However, many real conditions and some medications can change the iris\u2019 color. Eye color may also change naturally over time, especially in early childhood. These changes may be harmless but should always be checked by a doctor. If there is a serious underlying cause, such as glaucoma or a malignant tumor, early treatment can improve a person\u2019s outlook.", "The sea is dark and full of terror. Well, perhaps not always terror, but certainly mysterious lifeforms, as evidenced by a bizarre purple blob that appeared off the coast of California the other week. Now, a new bemusing lump of biological matter has appeared near the shores of Bunbury, Western Australia, and it\u2019s safe to say that it caused some fishermen a bit of head-scratching. Smooth, pink, fleshy, and unbearably smelly, this chunky conundrum simply couldn\u2019t be identified \u2013 at least at first. Mark Watkins, a fisherman of 21 years, had clearly never seen anything like it. \"When we got closer we realized it had to be a dead whale because of the smell,\" he told the West Australian. \"Its stomach was full of gas so it was all bloated up.\" The stomachs of whales tend to be full of gas during life, but this is normally kept under control. Floating up to the surface some time after death, the Sun's rays began to hit the whale's abdomen, causing the gases to expand and ultimately forcing the stomach to swell up. On occasion, this can cause the cetacean to explode with dramatic, gore-filled fury. After drifting away from the carcass, Watkins spotted it beginning to deflate. It looked like a few sharks had turned up and taken a few bites out of the ex-whale, which had caused its gastrointestinal gas and fluids to flood out into the Indian Ocean. Although the exact species of the whale hasn\u2019t been declared, it\u2019s likely to be a humpback or southern right whale, two of the most common types found off the western Australian coastline. \"Seeing it was great,\" Watkins noted on Facebook. \"The smell, not so much.\" Clearly, the entire experience was quite over-whale-ming (sorry). A non-deceased humpback whale. Gudkov Andrey/Shutterstock", "We\u2019ve all met one \u2014 the married person who\u2019s moonlighting on Tinder or Hinge as a single looking for love. Just last week, a survey showed that roughly 40 percent of people using Tinder were already coupled up. (Tinder denies the figure is accurate.) Hinge, a popular dating app that connects users to friends of their Facebook friends, had a similar problem. After digging through data, Hinge\u2019s researchers found that 1.6 percent of their users were married or engaged. Another 2 percent were in a relationship. So they\u2019re tackling the problem. The latest version of the Hinge app will pull self-reported data from Facebook into Hinge users\u2019 profiles. If your Hinge match has set his or her relationship status to \"married,\" \"engaged,\" or \"in a relationship,\" that information will now show up to potential matches. \"While this seems low, we want to ensure Hinge remains a trusted place for finding relationships,\" the company wrote on its blog. Of course, the new version of the app will only bust cheaters who happen to list their relationship statuses on Facebook. According to a recent interactive poll on BuzzFeed, 35 percent of people in relationships never share that information with Facebook. In the future, Hinge could use predictive algorithms to get a better handle on its users\u2019 relationship statuses. A 2013 Facebook-run study showed that the company could figure out who the most important people in your life were \u2014 including your romantic partner \u2014 by analyzing the way you interacted with people through Facebook, an effect it called \"dispersion.\" As I wrote in 2013: This metric measures how well two people\u2019s mutual friends are interconnected. It\u2019s a departure from previous \"embeddedness\" models, which counts the number of mutual friends two people have in common. Dispersion hones in on people who span diverse parts of your life, but who don\u2019t fit nicely into siloed, well-defined categories like coworkers, college classmates, and dance buddies....These friends may not rank highly on other measures of interaction \u2014 such as messages sent and received, profile viewing, or tags in photos \u2014 but they\u2019re extremely important people in your life. According to the Facebook study, \"on married users in our sample, the friend who scores highest under this dispersion measure is the user\u2019s spouse over 60% of the time.\" So be warned, Hinge cheaters \u2014 you may be able to hide by tweaking your Facebook account settings for now, but the algorithms are coming for you.", "Best Buy Has An Insane Xbox One Deal For A Limited Time, Get The Details By William Usher Those aren't the only two versions discounted, though.

Still, it would be remiss of us not to point out how big the Chilis\u2019 crowd is tonight: it feels twice as large as Biffy\u2019s or Disclosure\u2019s.The frontman doesn\u2019t say much tonight - Flea, as usual, does most of the talking - but when he does open his mouth, it\u2019s to share this nugget of wisdom with us: \"All these firefighters and they don't know how to put out a flare/ Shit, it's hard to breathe, might set fire to your pubic hair/ I might have to do a WWE into that table full of drinks down there.\" Um, thanks for that, Anthony. The Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 drummer is a 54 year-old man who\u2019s never worn a baseball cap the right way round, and he remains this band\u2019s resident badass. There\u2019s no way any group featuring this guy is the worst one in the universe. It\u2019s a Red Hot Chili Peppers show; you make allowances for gratuitous slap bass. At times, however, it feels like every spare moment is filled with Flea\u2019s fiddling, and it never fails to grate on your nerves. A useful gauge during these moments is to look around and see who looks like they\u2019re having more fun, him or the crowd. Guess what the answer is.Of the many, many former members of RHCP, you could argue that ex-guitarist John Frusciante was \u2013 even more so than founding member Hillel Slovak \u2013 the only irreplaceable one. Yet Josh Klinghoffer, the man tasked with filling Frusciante\u2019s shoes, is proving a more than capable substitute. Frusciante is still missed \u2013 Keidis recently said of him that, \"Never did I meet someone who was so easy to write songs with\" \u2013 but Klinghoffer is making the role his own. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been together for over thirty years, and the fact that they haven\u2019t completely succumbed to the power of nostalgia is admirable. Even so, it\u2019s fair to say that songs like \u2018Dark Necessities\u2019 and \u2019Go Robot\u2019 - both taken from the band\u2019s new album, \u2018The Getaway\u2019 - are tolerated, rather than celebrated, tonight. Say what you will about the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but any band packing a tune as glorious as \u2018Under The Bridge\u2019 don\u2019t deserve the scorn of Fox News. You might have heard their signature track a thousand times before, but it never sounds overplayed \u2013 unlike, say, set-closer \u2018Give It Away\u2019. Look, it\u2019s no small thing to be the worst band in the universe. This is a universe, after all, in which Nickelback, Limp Bizkit and The Pigeon Detectives all exist on the same planet.

According to new research, however, this and other \"body-focused repetitive behaviors\" may actually be indicative of something else entirely. According to a study published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, nail-biting might just be indicative of... perfectionism?? Dr. Kieron O\u2019Connor, author of the study, said \"We believe that individuals with these repetitive behaviors may be perfectionistic, meaning that they are unable to relax and to perform tasks at a normal pace. They are therefore prone to frustration, impatience, and dissatisfaction when they do not reach their goals.\" Basically, nail-biters aren't trying to alleviate their nerves - they're doing it out of frustration. The Study Researchers studied 48 participants, half of whom had repetitive behaviors like nail-biting. The participants filled out surveys designed to test their organizational behavior and emotional regulation. The nail-biters were identified as being organizational perfectionists, a personality type marked by a tendency to make detailed plans and overwork themselves, and they often become frustrated by a lack of activity. Nail-biting and other repetitive behaviors are just their way of releasing their pent-up energy. Impact Of The Study Nail-biting might seem relatively harmless, but it can cause some long-term damage. WebMD says that nail-biting can lead to infection, weak teeth, and deformed nails. These risks, along with how prevalent this behavior is, have made nail-biting one of the leading areas that psychotherapists work with their clients on. \"These findings suggest that individuals suffering from body-focused repetitive behaviors could benefit from treatments designed to reduce frustration and boredom and to modify perfectionist beliefs,\" said Sarah Roberts, who also helped author the study. Do you bite your nails? Are you a perfectionist? Here are some signs: You think in \"all-or-nothing\" terms; you see things as black or white You are very hard on yourself You get upset when you fail to achieve a goal Even when you do achieve a goal, you're still not satisfied You can't start something until the \"perfect moment\" - which may never arrive", "There\u2019s one group of Americans that consistently cares about climate change \"This is climate change. It\u2019s going to get worse.\" By Jeremy Deaton Violeta Maya lives on the west side of Brooklyn, along a busy highway, in a neighborhood spare of trees and green spaces. Now 80, Maya emigrated from Puerto Rico when she was a child. In the intervening decades, she has watched pollution from cars and factories cloud the skies above her home. \"We have a lot of pollution, and this has caused a lot of asthma,\" Maya, who suffers from asthma herself, said. \"They bring more stuff into this community than they do into Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, anywhere else. We can\u2019t breathe.\" \"This is climate change. It\u2019s going to get worse.\" For Maya, the hazards extend beyond the noxious fumes seeping from tailpipes and smokestacks. Planet-warming carbon pollution is fueling record-breaking heat around the country and in New York. She can feel it. \"The heat is so bad that my doctor said to me, \u2018You cannot go out in the heat,\u2019\" she said. \"I see older people with umbrellas. I see people who have to hold onto the gate for a while to catch their breath. This is climate change. It\u2019s going to get worse.\" Sunset Park, Brooklyn. CREDIT: Wikipedia Maya isn\u2019t alone. Poll after poll after poll after poll after poll finds Hispanics and Latinos are more likely to acknowledge the climate is changing, worry about the threat, and support policy to slow the rise in temperature \u2014 even though they are less likely to identify as environmentalists. Why? One possibility is that Latinos tend to lean left and vote Democrat. But even among Democrats, people of color are more likely to believe climate change should be a top priority for policymakers. Among Americans of color, Hispanics and Latinos stand out: Several polls \u2014 see here, here and here \u2014 find they are more likely to support pro-climate policy than African Americans, even though they are less likely to identify as liberal or Democrat. There a few guesses as to why this is the case. Foreign-born Latinos may care more because they have strong ties to countries that are threatened by climate change. Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico are acutely vulnerable to heat, drought coastal flooding. Severe heat is worsening pollution in Mexico City, making the air almost unbreathable. Analysis from Pew suggests the lurking variable is age. \"With a median age of 27 years, Hispanics are significantly younger than whites (42), blacks (33) and the nation as a whole (37). Overall, younger Americans are more likely than older Americans to say the Earth is warming because of human activity.\" It is difficult to tease the signal from the noise. The more you slice and dice the numbers, the harder it becomes to make inferences about any particular group. In surveys of American adults, Hispanics typically make a up a small subset of the data. The key variable may not be age or country of origin, but rather who stands on the front lines of climate change and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 who doesn\u2019t. Feeling the brunt of climate change In a recent study, Maryland residents were asked about their perceptions of climate risks. Vulnerable groups saw themselves as being more at risk to the impacts of climate change. \"Historically socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, such as Hispanics, Latinos, and African Americans, may face higher exposure to environmental risks and have less capacity to adapt,\" Karen Akerlof, George Mason University social scientist and the study\u2019s lead author, said. Even when controlling for ideology and acceptance of climate change, Akerlof explained, \"we find that Hispanics and Latinos are significantly more likely [than whites] to think that they themselves and their households are at risk from the health effects of climate change.\" Los Angeles on a smoggy day. CREDIT: Wikipedia Hispanics are more likely to live in cities, near polluting factories, power plants and refineries. According to a report from the National Hispanic Medical Association, they are more likely to suffer from asthma or other bronchial maladies as a result. Owing to the urban heat island effect, Hispanics are also more vulnerable to heat waves\u2014 a threat compounded, oftentimes, by limited access to air conditioning or medical care. \"In many cases, we\u2019re talking about people who are in lower income brackets and live in urban areas that are potentially prone to high heat indexes,\" said Akerlof. \"These are obviously populations of concern.\" \"These are obviously populations of concern.\" Just as relevant as the statistics regarding who feels vulnerable to climate change is who doesn\u2019t. Akerlof pointed to a series of studies highlighting the \"white male effect.\" Again and again, studies find that white men are more likely to dismiss the risks of climate change. White men tend to earn more money. They tend to be more conservative. In general, they feel less vulnerable to environmental risks and are less likely to support environmental regulation. It would appear that white men oppose changing a system that largely benefits white men. \"What you\u2019re seeing there is that basically everybody else is normal. White males are abnormal,\" said Akerlof. \"They\u2019re not recognizing the true risks because they\u2019re so invested in the system that they do not want to see anything that would threaten the current status quo.\" Cesar Chavez, 1972. CREDIT: Environmental Protection Agency What social scientists find in the data, many Latinos have long felt. Mexican-American labor leader Cesar Chavez gave voice to this idea in a 1970 essay for Playboy magazine. \"It\u2019s amazing how people can get so excited about a rocket to the moon and not give a damn about smog, oil leaks, the devastation of the environment with pesticides, hunger, disease,\" Chavez wrote. \"When the poor share some of the power that the affluent now monopolize, we will give a damn.\" Climate change will be a defining issue for the next generation of Latinos. As the demographics shift and Hispanics make up a larger portion of American society, expect public opinion to follow suit. What some people have referred to as \"the browning of America\" may also be its greening.", "And a child shall build it? A long-discussed footbridge project over a Key West waterway has been resuscitated by unlikely champion: a 10-year-old girl who presented plans to City Commissioners last week for an 85-foot rainbow-colored span that would salute Key West's diversity. \"Key West welcomes many different people,\" Adelle Barsky-Moore of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea told commissioners. \"It has equality for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders. The bridge will celebrate diversity with the many colors of the gay pride flag.\" And it could become reality. Barsky-Moore, whose parents are gay, first conceived of the \"Rainbow Pride Bridge\" for a 4th grade class project, spending three weeks building a popsicle-stick model and crafting a presentation, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Her bridge will be \"more fabulous\" than rainbow-colored crosswalks installed in West Hollywood, her PowerPoint presentation promised commissioners. Barsky-Moore calculated the span, built of steel and wood, will cost roughly $132,500 -- but could be partially paid for with funds raised by selling name inscriptions at $100 each. Though she originally designed the bridge for an area just west of Duval Street, commissioners thought it would be perfect over Admiral's Cut as part of a $30 million master plan to develop former Navy property on the waterfront. \"I thought it was a brilliant idea,\" City Commissioner Jimmy Weekley told KeysNet.com. \"I'm going to push this forward and try to get this accomplished.\" Key West first has to come to an agreement with a family who owns the land in question, Weekley said. But not only did Barsky-Moore's presentation win \"initial endorsement\" from the city commission, KeysNews.com reports St. Petersburg architect Andy Hayes, who happened to overhear her proposal, offered to donate design fees if the city moves on the project. There is one drawback, according to the Sun Sentinel: a new popsicle model may be necessary. \"A kid on my bus pretty much broke it,\" Barsky-Moore said.", "Reuters For years, economists have been saying that China needs to \"rebalance\" its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project. That means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular Chinese people working in the services sector. That is, China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers. But what if we've got this all wrong? What if China is transitioning too early? That's what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, \"China's new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.\" From the note (emphasis added): \"Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy's potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies. \"Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries. \"This kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. Given that China's GDP per capita is only 14% that of the US, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth.\" Work, work, work, work, work What really worries HSBC is that the service sector's jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The bank's analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter. HSBC Arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the Chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project \u2014 if not in deed, then certainly in word. The reason for that is simple: debt. China has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 280%. Most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. In 2009, when the world was falling apart, the Chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam. That, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in Chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors. So, to combat that overcapacity, China would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they're making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of. The rest of the world would love that, too. Last week, the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the Chinese economy , \"Evaluating the Financial Risks of China,\" and much of it focused on what that country's economic slowdown has done to the American steel industry. During the hearing, Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. He also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the Chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. In reality, 300 million tons had been added to China's steel output. So what Gibson would like is for China to slow its production and wind the steel industry down. The problem with this solution, says HSBC, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that China won't grow as fast \u2014 not just in the short term, but also in the long term. From the note (emphasis added): \"The efficiency loss during such a 'rebalancing' can be huge. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). Based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated RMB45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. Therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, China's total output in 2015 could have been RMB225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual GDP.\" HSBC suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. But, to be honest, the Chinese government hasn't shown that kind of subtlety. Even now, banks continue to lend to unproductive corporations in order to keep workers employed and avoid a hard landing in the short term. Meanwhile, the transition to the service sector continues.

The photo, which was originally shared on Imgur, has recently resurfaced online to cause confusion.  On close inspection, there appears to be no seat on the bench and the women are hovering mid air.  The most likely explanation is that the bench features smaller pull out seats.   The snap is the latest in a long line of optical illusion photos to leave people baffled.

Because the photograph contains a camouflaged mobile phone that is devilishly hard to spot.   If you are struggling, the phone has a floral pattern which does not quite match the carpet.  Still confused? The device is just beside the right side table leg at the top of the photo. It may seem a simple find, but it has left thousands bewildered.

The results found that seven hours spent in deep sleep is the perfect amount to maintain reasonable insulin production and glucose levels. This means that the amount of time spent in bed is probably more than seven hours - more like seven and a half. Sleeping less than seven hours has been proven to disrupt glucose metabolism in men and women. A stable glucose level contributes to weight control, and if it is disrupted, could lead to weight gain, and the early onset of diabetes. So how do Britons fare?

She was told to wait for a church to pick up items left in the freezer, but when the church never came, \"I decided to open it,\" the unidentified woman said. The seller has left town, and the body parts were sent to authorities to identify. (Reuters) When the Goldsboro, N.C., resident spotted the freezer at her neighbor\u2019s yard sale last month, she thought she was getting a good deal. The neighbor was charging $30 for a deep freezer with a hinged lid \u2014 the kind of freezer large enough for someone to climb inside. But the neighbor said there was a caveat, she recalled to WNCN. She couldn\u2019t start using the freezer immediately because the neighbor had promised to lend it out to her church\u2019s Sunday school class for a \"time capsule\" project. The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, says her neighbor told her the church would come to pick up the items inside the freezer, which was sealed shut with duct tape. Afterwards, the buyer was supposed to get the freezer back. So the woman waited. Three weeks passed; the church members never came. \"Nothing was adding up, so I started to become suspicious about it,\" the woman told WRAL. She was keeping the freezer plugged in in the corner of a spare bedroom, alongside houseplants, an armchair, a vacuum cleaner and spare toiletries. Last Friday, she peeled off the duct tape and looked inside. The first things the woman saw were a green sheet and a bag of kitty litter, she told WTVD. Then, her eyes landed on a human foot. \"I saw toes and a foot and ankle,\" the woman said. She slammed the freezer shut. It must be fake, she thought to herself, opening the lid again. This time, she was sure it was real. \"My heart went into my throat,\" the woman told WRAL. She ran out of the house and called 911. \"I have a serious problem,\" she told the 911 dispatcher. \"My neighbor sold me a deep freezer. I just opened it and there\u2019s a body in there I think.\" \"Your neighbor sold it to you?\" the dispatcher asked. \"I am freaking out,\" she responded, short of breath. \"I understand, ma\u2019am,\" said the dispatcher. \"Your neighbor sold it to you?\" \"Yes,\" she said. The Goldsboro Police Department said in a statement on Wednesday that an autopsy confirmed the freezer indeed contained human remains. The body belonged to a Goldsboro resident, but her identity is being withheld until next of kin can be notified, police said. The medical examiner determined that there were no signs of foul play and her death was natural. The police are investigating. Concealing the death of a person is a felony, and disposal of bodies is controlled by state hygiene and environmental laws. The name of the original freezer owner has not been released. The woman who bought the freezer has a strong and disturbing suspicion: that her neighbor dumped her own mother\u2019s dead body inside the freezer. The woman told WNCN that her neighbor\u2019s elderly mother had lived with her, but she hadn\u2019t seen her since September, when the mother had a stroke. The mother had interacted with the woman when she was sick, she told WTVD: \"I recognized the foot. It was her mother\u2019s foot.\" Other neighbors said the freezer seller has since moved to West Virginia, where she told people she was visiting her mother at a nursing home. \"I think maybe the daughter was dependent on the mother\u2019s check and didn\u2019t know what else to do,\" the woman told WRAL. Speaking to WTVD, she said: \"I\u2019m glad that I was the one who was chosen to be able to find her mother so that that poor woman can rest.\"", "If we sit down to think, then almost every old wives tale is a story within a story.

The scientists found the colossal trough while charting the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands, an ancient subglacial mountain range in the area, and detailed the discovery in a paper published in the January issue of the Geological Society of America Bulletin. \"The discovery of this huge trough, and the characterization of the surrounding mountainous landscape, was incredibly serendipitous,\" the paper's lead author, Dr. Neil Ross, a physical geography lecturer at Newcastle University in the U.K., said in a written statement. \"To me, this just goes to demonstrate how little we still know about the surface of our own planet. The discovery and exploration of hidden, previously unknown landscapes is still possible and incredibly exciting, even now.\" Dubbed Ellsworth Trough, the trench was created tens of million years ago by a small, \"dynamic\" ice field that slowly carved out the dramatic formations now hidden beneath a layer of ice more than a mile thick. With the help of ice-penetrating radar, the scientists found the trough to be more than 186 miles long, up to 15 miles across and, in some places, 1.8 miles deep, according to a written statement released by Bristol University. The Grand Canyon has an average depth of about 1 mile and maximum width of 17.9 miles. The Ellsworth Trough is so large, it can be seen from space -- yes, even beneath all of that ice. As Gizmodo reported, NASA helped researchers map the trough by sharing satellite imagery that provided a big-picture view of the subglacial canyon. \"By looking at the topography beneath the ice sheet using a combination of ice-penetrating radio-echo sounding and satellite imagery, we have revealed a region which possesses classic glacial geomorphic landforms, such as u-shaped valleys and cirques, that could only have been formed by a small ice cap, similar to those seen at present in the Canadian and Russian High Arctic,\" Dr. Martin Siegert, a member of the research team and professor of geosciences at the University of Bristol in the U.K., said in the written statement. \"The region uncovered is, therefore, the site of ice sheet genesis in West Antarctica.\"", "We may take it for granted, but texting really is one of the most significant technological advancements of the past several years. The ability to send short, instant messages helps us build and maintain strong relationships, even when we\u2019re too busy to call. When we aren\u2019t able to get in touch with those people we text the most, it\u2019s jarring. Why aren\u2019t they available to us right now? we\u2019ll wonder. But for one mother, it was an unexpected message that shook her to her core... Carole Adler couldn\u2019t have been closer to her son, Taylor Thyfault. The young man would frequently text his mother about all sorts of things to keep up with her. They were always in touch. Just about any mother would speak highly of her children, but there was something extra special about the way that Carole talked about Taylor. Their relationship was undoubtedly a close one, ever since day one. Of course, the feeling was mutual for Taylor, who wasn\u2019t shy about telling his mother about all sorts of important things. He\u2019d often tell her about all of his life\u2019s goals, many of which he was lucky and hard-working enough to achieve. For example, Taylor told his mother about a list of various things that he wanted to accomplish in his life, including wrestling an alligator, coaching a lacrosse team, owning an English bulldog he would name Diesel, and never getting arrested. Taylor seemed determined to achieve everything on his list. He joined the U.S. Army and he really took the motto of being \"the best that [he] could be\" to heart\u2014despite his mother\u2019s concerns about the dangers of his profession. Another one of Taylor\u2019s goals was to pursue a career, but he didn\u2019t want just any old job. He became a state trooper, which allowed him to create plenty of opportunities to achieve another one of his goals: to save a life. As proud and supportive as Carole was of her son, she also couldn\u2019t help but be concerned about the dangers of his job. One day, at the scene of an accident, Taylor decided to text her updates on the situation... It was May 23, 2015, and Taylor\u2019s cadet training was almost complete. Very soon, he would be a fully fledged police officer, just like he had always dreamed. For the time being, though, he still had a job to do on this ride-along. Carole\u2019s memory of that fateful morning remained crystal clear. \"Taylor texted me that day at 7:30 and said \u2018I\u2019m at an accident at Highway One and Highway 66,'\" she recalled, sadly. Taylor, along with another trooper, were warned of a potentially dangerous high-speed chase that was heading in their direction. So they both set up stop sticks to try to slow down the oncoming encounter. That\u2019s when tragedy struck. When the car in question came rushing toward the two men, the driver didn\u2019t stop \u2014 and he hit both of them. The other trooper was critically injured, while Taylor was killed instantly. Yet the two men in uniform weren\u2019t alone. There was also a tow truck driver at the scene of the original accident who came out almost completely unscathed \u2014 and it was all because the heroic Taylor had shouted at him to get out of the way before he lost his own life. This was undeniably a tragedy, but there was at least one bittersweet aspect of the story. In his final moments, Taylor had managed to complete one last goal from the list that was so important to him: he saved a life. Taylor had died a hero. He\u2019d accomplished a great deal in his short life, but there were still so many things that he would never have the opportunity to experience. However, his legacy didn\u2019t exactly end there... Taylor didn\u2019t tell anybody about the list but his mother she was even the last person that he spoke to before he died. Clearly, they had a special bond. As she mourned the loss of her son, Carole continued to text him, knowing he couldn\u2019t answer. Carole thought that nobody else would know about her secret messages to her deceased son, but there was, in fact, a living person who was seeing every text that she sent. He happened to be another police officer... After Taylor\u2019s untimely death, Sergeant Kell Hulsey needed a phone with a new number. Incidentally, he received the young man\u2019s old number, and he formed an unexpected connection with Carole. Initially, the police sergeant ignored Carole\u2019s mysterious messages, but once he figured out what was going on, he couldn\u2019t let it go any longer. What happened next was an extraordinary moment... \"I\u2019m with the Greeley Police Department, and I don\u2019t think your texts are going where you think they are,\" Sergeant Kell Hulsey sent. He then offered to switch numbers, but Carole insisted that he keep it. The grieving mother said that it eased her sorrow knowing the line was going to someone who had the job her son dreamed of one day doing. \"I am honored that a police officer of your credentials has his number,\" she told him. Carole still texts with Husley, who, after hearing about Taylor, has found a renewed passion for his career and is grateful to know that he has someone else looking out for him. Adler still texts him, reminding him to be safe. \"It\u2019s good for me to remember all the wonderful things he was looking forward to,\" Husley says. \"It\u2019s like I always have a little angel in my pocket now.\" Though Taylor\u2019s actions ultimately led to a life being saved, it also proves how a person\u2019s passion can sometimes put them in harm\u2019s way. Connor Cummings, a second-year college student from Rockaway, New Jersey knew this all too well... Connor loved getting involved with anything that allowed him to flex his creative muscles, and he had a strong passion for photography. Friends said it was rare to catch him without a camera in his hand. In fact, he\u2019d recently landed a job taking photos at his school in Massachusetts \u2014 a dream job for someone like Connor. Naturally, he saw it as a huge stepping stone to a photography career once he graduated college. Over Christmas break in 2015, his parents bought him a brand-new Canon camera to congratulate him on landing the job. They wanted him to start with his best foot forward, and a sleek new camera was the first step towards success. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Connor ventured into New York City to get some photographs of the cityscape at night. The city had amazing views, and the young photographer wanted to capture its beauty through his new lens. Along with his friend, 18-year-old Dimitri Olivares, who also had a knack for photography, Connor headed into the city. The two young men were excited to return with a roll full of great pictures to show their friends and family. The boys hopped a subway into Midtown, and as soon as they got off, they headed to a building near Times Square to start shooting. They could already sense some spectacular images were about to materialize. Soon enough, their search for some even better views led the boys to the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street. They knew hotels often boasted rooftop balconies, and they were excited to find awesome angles of the Big Apple. Far from being concerned about security, they walked right into the hotel and stepped into the elevator, taking it to the top floor, which was 52 stories up. Once there, they climbed a few flights of stairs to the roof \u2014 and found the door unlocked. The roof, however, wasn\u2019t as high as the intrepid shutterbugs wanted to get. So when they spotted some scaffolding, they decided it was the perfect way to find the right vantage point without the risk of getting caught by hotel security. Cameras held tightly in their grasp, the two boys carefully climbed the scaffolding. Eventually, Connor asked Dimitri to pose for a picture mid-climb, and that\u2019s when tragedy struck... As Connor was positioning himself to take the picture, he stepped back through a hole in the scaffolding. The hole hung above a nine-story drop\u2014and Connor plummeted to his death.

The music legend has produced and released many Billboard chart-toppers and Grammy Award winners over the years, but admits that even he doesn't always get it right. When Gordy appeared on \"Oprah's Master Class,\" he opened up about a Temptations album he didn't want to release -- an album that won Motown its first Grammy. The reason behind Gordy's reluctance? Responsibility. \"A song is a very powerful thing in somebody's mind, especially young people,\" Gordy explains. \"I taught my [Motown staff], 'What a child hears, he believes; what he believes, he does.'... We stayed away from songs that were attacking anybody because a lot of people will follow our songs and song ideas.\" This meant that Gordy would argue against a song or album that didn't align with his vision for Motown. He may have been the founder of the company, but was so dedicated to its democratic structure, he would allow himself to be outvoted by his Motown colleagues. This is exactly what happened with the Temptations' psychedelic album \"Cloud Nine.\" \"I said that was a drug record and I didn't want to put it out,\" Gordy says simply. \"[My staff] outvoted me. I was very, very upset.\" Motown released \"Cloud Nine,\" despite Gordy's disapproval, and the album's title track won the Grammy for Best Rhythm & Blues Group Performance, Vocal or Instrumental in 1969. \"It happened, it won and so that was great.

When he turned 65, two years ago, he was besieged with health insurance policy offerings for Medigap coverage. Medicare doesn't cover everything; that's why you probably need MediGap coverage. And watch out for Medicare premium surcharges if your income is over $85,000 ($170,000 for joint filers). These points come as a surprise for many as they approach or hit retirement. Are you ready or does this comment from a research participant sound familiar? I've seen the numbers about what health care can cost and it's hard to wrap your head around. I haven't even started thinking about that when saving for retirement. People feel health is the one key to a happy retirement, but it's also the biggest worry. For Americans of all ages in the study, the said their top financial worry in retirement is that they or a loved one will have a costly health issue. When asked, Which aspect of your life has been the greatest source of worry for the past 12 months? finances was in first overall, but by age, for those 65 to 74, health takes over as the top worry, and 44% of those 75-plus cite it as their top worry. Despite these concerns, healthcare is often a missing link in retirement planning, the report says. Fewer than one in six pre-retirees (15%) have ever attempted to estimate how much money they might need for health care and long-term care in retirement. And only 42% have health care directives, essential estate planning documents that specify who will determine how your medical care is carried out if you're unable to make decisions yourself. The good news is that people seem ready to take action. In the study, 91% of retirees say they're willing to make healthier choices now to save money later, and 83% say they'll reevaluate their health insurance plan options. Overall, people are kind of hopeful, adaptable and resilient, says Dychtwald. Here are some action steps you can take now. The responsibility for retirement funding is shifting more and more towards individuals and that includes for health care expenses.  Growing your general retirement stash can help cover extra health care costs. So take full advantage of tax-advantaged retirement plans, and bump up your savings rate, says Lorna Sabbia, head of retirement & personal wealth solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Check if your employer offers specialized tax-advantaged healthcare savings options. A healthcare flexible spending account helps cut costs on current year healthcare expenses (the contribution limit for 2017 is $2,600). Some plans let you carry over a $500 balance into the next plan year. If you have a high deductible health insurance plan, you can save in a tax-advantaged health savings account and if you don't use the money for current out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, you can invest it and save it as a retirement healthcare kitty. If you didn't max out your contributions for 2016, you can do so up until you file your 2016 tax return (due April 18, 2017). The contribution limit for singles is $3,350 ($3,400 for 2017) and $6,750 for family coverage. Consider long-term care insurance. Only 30% of people say they think they'll need long-term care, but in reality, seven in ten will need it at some point in their lifetimes on average lasting three years, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That doesn't mean you need to buy long-term care insurance, Dychtwald says, although he notes that personally he and his wife have it. But it means you need to make sure you have resources available in case care is needed. Engage the whole family. Talking about finances can still be taboo, but that's a mistake. Some 70% of married pre-retirees have not even discussed with their spouses health care in retirement and how to pay for it, the study found. And 70% of Americans have not had in-depth discussions on net worth, long-term care, or wills and inheritance with their parents. Here are seven questions to start a family legacy conversation. Take a walk or a run. Last year the average retiree watched a lot of tv and exercised very little. Seek out the very best version of you you can, Dychtwald says.", "You can\u2019t imagine what place exactly she gave birth ! Yes, it was in a hockey player\u2019s bag. This happened when a team of hockey players were in their practice. They found her and her babies on May 15th before their weekly Sunday night practice. Dan Klein a hockey player of Gwangyang Crazy Eagles from South Korea explains the story. She would climb through one of his windows where they kept open to help their equipment dry. Then they discovered a litter of four tiny babies. They think that the cat stayed in the equipment room for at most 3 days. But the cat is not stranger to the players, because they saw her walking around and they believe that she lives around the arena. The bag belonged to one of their goalies. When the mama cat realized that the players were coming, she looked at them very happy and it was like she was introducing her babies to the whole team. Now the kittens are doing fine and they are safe, the players were been doting on them. The team also helped the mama with food, water and a lot of love too. According to the team, an older gentleman who takes care of the rink took the furry family into his house, where is located next to the equipment room. He and his wife will take care of them. This is a crazy place to give birth but in the same time is funny . This story mama cat decided that her babies would be born in her favorite place of her favorite team of course !!. I hope they are safe and sure now they receive a lot of love from the players ! Source : Love Meow", "In November, Marvel Studios\u2019 fourteenth theatrical release Doctor Strange will open the doors to the quantum realm and expose audiences to a brand new side of the cinematic universe. Fans of the MCU have already been introduced to the power of technology in Iron Man, the limits of the human body in Captain America: The First Avenger, otherworldly magic with Thor, and Ant-Man showed everyone how small the world can really get. In the past decade, Marvel has become the standard-bearer for contemporary blockbuster filmmaking. There are a lot of reasons for the studio\u2019s success ranging, from exemplary casting, solid narrative structure, and wealth of source material to draw creative inspiration from. However, despite all their success, there is plenty of room for their storytelling to grow. One of the most prevalent criticisms of Marvel Studios\u2019 theatrical releases is that the films lack memorable villains that will stand the test of time, with critics pointing out that their roster of baddies all seem to mimic the given protagonist\u2019s own skill set. While Marvel\u2019s methodology may be transparent, their approach to introducing villains is by design. During our visit to the set of Doctor Strange, Marvel President Kevin Feige stated the benefits of telling superhero origin stories with villains who mirror the lead: \"Clearly we will get to that [non-doppelganger match ups]... You want to have characters that inhabit the same world when introducing a new world, a new mythology for lack of a better term. You want to explore that as much as you can.\" Marvel\u2019s approach of starting out with villains that resemble the hero isn\u2019t unique to the MCU \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s a core part of the modern superhero origin movie. In Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman Begins, the main character had to face off against a dark reflection of himself in Ra\u2019s Al Ghul, and that kind of reflection can be a valuable part of the hero\u2019s journey narrative: highlighting the protagonist\u2019s heroism by showing how they could just as easily used their powers to become a villain. Similarly, in Warner Bros.\u2019 first DC Extended Universe movie, Man of Steel, the antagonist was General Zod \u2013 a Kryptonian with identical abilities to Superman, who uses those abilities for the purposes of destruction. In building the MCU, Marvel made the practice of using villains as dark reflections of heroism a core part of each origin story. The Iron Monger (Jeff Bridges) may be the most forgettable Marvel villain yet, but his presence put a spotlight on Tony Stark\u2019s \u2013 and Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s \u2013 unique brand of ingenuity and charm, which resulted in an iconic hero for the ages. Doctor Strange will introduce sorcery and mysticism into the MCU, staying relatively faithful to its comic book origins while also introducing the film\u2019s primary antagonist, Kaecilius , played by Mads Mikkelsen (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story): a former Master of the Mystic Arts who was trained in the ways of sorcery long before the events of the movie. The choice of Kaecilius as the movie\u2019s antagonist and his similarities to Strange are far from arbitrary, and Feige explains why yet another evil reflection of a Marvel hero was needed in the upcoming Doctor Strange film: \"Kaecilius doesn\u2019t know Strange from a hole in the wall. He predates him. But when you\u2019re teaching an audience about sorcerers and that reality and you\u2019re going to talk about the past anyway and you\u2019re going to get into their history anyway, much better to tie-in your bad guy with that instead of laying all this groundwork of parallel dimensions and sorcery and say, by the way, a meteor hit on the other side of the world, it went under the water, and this evil thing developed. What does that have to do with magic? Nothing... That\u2019s not the way we\u2019ve developed them up to this point. \" Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have explained that Captain America: Civil War was only the beginning of a prolonged battle that will extend into Avengers: Infinity War , in which our heroes will face off against the strange and powerful villain Thanos. Barring the surprise addition of a purple alien Avenger with a big chin who doesn\u2019t like standing up , Thanos doesn\u2019t appear to be a direct doppelganger of any major MCU superheroes, and Feige explains that the diversification of hero/villain dynamics will continue as the cinematic universe moves away from origin stories: \"Needless to say as more characters encounter each other in other films they\u2019re certainly going to be up against things that they don\u2019t know anything about and have no comparable to.\" There is great narrative power in having a visual representation of a protagonist\u2019s potential dark side. The doppelganger is often an exploration of what the hero would be like without an agreeable moral code. Once that line is established, exceeding the lead character\u2019s known limitations is what creates unforgettable heroes. However, Marvel\u2019s characters are maturing and the studio finds themselves at a narrative and thematic crossroads for all of the core Avengers. In the third phase of Marvel\u2019s films, the superhero\u2019s world has become infinitely more complicated. There is a gradual overhaul of Marvel\u2019s overall structure, that began in Civil War and will continue beyond Avengers: Infinity War. While the doppelganger trope will probably never go extinct, due to its roots in comic books. It looks like fans are poised to finally find out exactly what happens when the separate worlds of the Marvel cinematic universe collide. And for the first time, it does not feel familiar at all. Doctor Strange opens November 4, 2016; Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 \u2013 May 5, 2017; Spider-Man: Homecoming \u2013 July 7, 2017; Thor: Ragnarok \u2013 November 3, 2017; Black Panther \u2013 February 16, 2018; Avengers: Infinity \u2013 May 4, 2018; Ant-Man and the Wasp \u2013 July 6, 2018; Captain Marvel\u2013 March 8, 2019; Untitled Avengers \u2013 May 3, 2019; and as-yet-untitled Marvel movies on July 12, 2019, and on May 1, July 10, and November 6 in 2020.", "There\u2019s a lot to talk about in the Star Wars: The Force Awakens teaser trailer, but there\u2019s only so much talking. Two short little phrases: \"There has been an awakening. Have you felt it?\" Followed by \"The dark side...and the light.\" With all the visuals that we can break down, there\u2019 are only these two brief snippets of actual dialogue to consider. The first and most important question may be, who is speaking? The identity of the narrator was a big topic of discussion Friday after the trailer hit. Speculation about the person\u2019s identity ran from Max Von Sydow to Adam Driver, Andy Serkis and even Benedict Cumberbatch. The last one isn\u2019t even in the movie, but it sounds a bit like him. Because he was at the center of J.J. Abrams\u2019 last big mystery, it was a fun option to consider. There will be no more considering. The identity of the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer voice has been revealed. Update: Andy Serkis has given a brief radio interview confirming that it is his voice in the trailer. Watch that below. The Force Awakens trailer voice is, in fact, Andy Serkis, seen below in his Avengers: Age of Ultron look. Steve from Collider was the first to definitely say the voice was Serkis. Still many remained skeptical. Harry Knowles from Ain\u2019t It Cool News even posted that he confirmed it was \"not\" Serkis, but that sentiment was quickly changed. Finally, Hitfix got on the case and bolstered Collider\u2019s earlier point: For the record, that is Andy Serkis you hear in the trailer. I was able to verify this, although I was not able to uncover any further information about the role he plays. Here\u2019s what I do know, though. He\u2019s playing a pivotal role in the film, although he will not have a lot of screen time. That\u2019s a very interesting piece of information. Does it make him an Emperor-like character? Possibly someone who\u2019ll play a larger role later in the series? You have to think, if Serkis\u2019 character can feel the event of the title \u2013 The Force Awakening \u2013 he\u2019s gotta be crucial. That\u2019s simply because not everyone can feel the Force. \"The Phantom Menace\" didn\u2019t play a huge role in that movie, but he sure did later on. Maybe you\u2019re still skeptical. Our own Dave Chen took a voice over performance from Cumberbatch and edited it back to back with this one, making it pretty obvious it\u2019s not that actor. So that\u2019s that. Andy Serkis is the voice in the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer. Now, if only we knew who was holding that red lightsaber. Update: Here\u2019s the video interview (via Empire) in which Serkis confirms his voice in the trailer, but refuses to divulge any further info.", "A second Catholic university in California this week has dropped elective abortion coverage for its staff. In a letter dated Oct. 3, Santa Clara University President Michael Engh announced the 2014 change to the Jesuit university's 1,600 employees. \"Our core commitments as a Catholic university are incompatible with the inclusion of elective abortion coverage in the University's health plans,\" Engh wrote in the letter. The move appears to be part of a trend among Catholic campuses seeking to uphold their religious beliefs while employing and enrolling many non-Catholics, the Los Angeles Times notes. Just this week, Loyola Marymount University, a Catholic university in Los Angeles, also announced that it will eliminate elective abortion coverage for its staff starting next year. The move by both universities was met with outrage by some of its staff, who thought there should have been more dialogue before a decision was made. \"The policy comes as quite a shock,\" Nancy Unger, a history professor at Santa Clara, said to NBC. \"There was no discussion. There was a request for discussion afterwards, which many of us felt was really sort of patronizing.\" President Obama's Affordable Care Act requires that birth control be covered but allows employers to restrict abortion coverage. Health plans must cover birth control under the Affordable Care Act, but Obamacare allows employers to offer plans that restrict abortion coverage. Father Jim Bretzke, a professor of moral theology at Boston College, sympathized with Santa Clara's decision. \"An elective abortion is a serious moral evil, and if it\u2019s in our power to end that on whatever level we can operate, we should do our best to end that moral evil,\" Bretzke said to CBS. \"They believe that that is a moral evil and so they\u2019re pursuing dropping that from their packages.\" The change by the universities moves in the opposite direction of California's abortion law. Just this week, Gov. Jerry Brown, himself a former Jesuit seminarian, signed a bill allowing nurses and midwives to perform abortions.", "Instead of encountering a mound of dirty towels and sheets, a cleaner was met with a stack of cash when she walked into a hotel room. Kyle and Josh from GiveBackFilms, a YouTube channel dedicated to random acts of kindness, surprised a hotel cleaner with a $500 tip this week. The maid's co-worker told Kyle and Josh, who have also carried out kind deeds such as paying for people's gas and making an IHOP waitress's day, that he was shocked by how hardworking she is. The video below shows the stunned cleaner initially refusing to accept the tip, before another hotel worker reassured her by saying, \"You deserve it.\"", "Harold Cunningham/Getty Images Investing in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition. You buy a bond. Then you get back interest payment. So easy, even your great uncle Mort can do it. Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate\u2019s senior business and economics correspondent. These days, things aren't so straightforward: The sovereign-debt markets have devolved into a bizarro world of upside-down expectations. Yields on government bonds from all around the world have been plunging thanks to anxious investors buying them for their safety. (Bond yields fall as prices rise.) And in many instances, the returns have cratered below zero. As Quartz reports Thursday, \"around a third of all developed-country government debt\u2014or more than $7 trillion, in terms of market value\u2014is now trading at negative yields,\" meaning that buyers are willing to pay more for these bonds than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity. This is remarkable. Countries like Germany have been selling short- and midterm debt at negative yields for a while, but now it\u2019s happening with bonds dated for 10 years or longer. Investors are basically banging down the door for the guarantee that they will only lose a little bit of money over the next decade or two. The most mind-blowing example of this trend is Switzerland. Last week, yields on all of its government bonds, out to 50 years, turned negative. Investors are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the Swiss for a half-century at a time. Other countries are getting nearly as good deals. Fifteen-year German and Japanese bond yields have also drifted below zero. Even economically wounded Spain can borrow for a few years at a time and theoretically make a profit. It's like a bad financial-world play on a Yakov Smirnoff joke: In Switzerland, lender pay you! Why are investors settling for these kinds of terms? For one, they don't see many other safe options. The world economy still feels shaky, especially after the Brexit vote, which sent bond yields even lower. Meanwhile, stashing cash in a vault somewhere costs money and effort\u2014you need to cover the cost of security and storage. So they're willing to pay governments to essentially hold their euros or yen or Swiss francs. The fact that long-dated bonds are going negative also means that the markets don't expect inflation to rise much down the line, which means they don't expect world growth to pick up much either. It may even be a sign that some investors see deflation on the horizon, since a bond with a negative yield could theoretically be profitable if prices fall enough in a country. All of which is to say: Today's sub-zero bond yields are a sign of how deeply pessimistic investors have become about both the near and somewhat distant future. And if they stay down, they could create some nasty problems of their own. When long-term interest rates fall too low, for instance, it makes it very hard for banks to earn a profit by borrowing and lending. This is playing out all over, but right now, people are looking very nervously at Italy's banks in particular, which are parched for profits while sitting on a pile of bad loans. As Matt O'Brien notes at the Washington Post, low bond yields around the world can make it hard for central banks to ever raise rates, since the second they do, investors will rush to buy that government's bonds. Among other things, that can push up the value of a currency, hurting exports and risking deflation.", "We tried 29 different kinds of hot sauce to find our favorite. What the hell were we thinking?

I had more parents in my office than ever before.\" It was new territory for Retzlaff, then principal of the school in Webster Groves, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, but it was never a question of whether she would or wouldn\u2019t open the bathroom. And as time passed, the calls slowly began to subside, going from once a day, to once a week, to once a month.  That was more than two years ago \u2013 a blip in the schoolwide effort to help the soon-to-be third-grader transition as seamlessly as possible from female to male \u2013 yet still no cohesive policy exists nationwide on the issue of bathroom access for transgender students.  Even before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting transgender rights, or this month\u2019s deadly mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students. Opponents of policies that accommodate the bathroom needs of transgender students have argued that it\u2019s an issue of safety for non-transgender students. In reality, however, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students face the greater risk of harassment and assault, especially transgender students, and supporters say the bathroom discussion should be focused on protecting their safety.  According to FBI statistics, more than 20 percent of reported hate crimes were attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity \u2013 second only to race, and more than attacks based on religious bias. Although some state attorneys general and legislators have taken the federal government to court over its directive instructing all public school districts to allow transgender students to use restrooms that match their gender identity, school districts in those very states have quietly dealt with the issue with relative ease.  And students, rather than state officials or school administrators, are often at the forefront in pushing for the change. Eliza Byard, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a New York-based organization that supports LGBT-inclusive policies for teachers and students, said school leaders and students live with the issue and understand it better than elected officials do. \"If they were listening to local authorities,\" she said, \"they\u2019d get out of the way.\" Atherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky, has had a policy in place for two years that allows transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, and Principal Thomas Aberli says there have been no problems.  \"The most recent federal guidelines are aligned with what we\u2019ve been doing for the past two years,\" Aberli said in an interview. Despite some concerns that permitting transgender students to use the appropriate bathroom might threaten the safety and privacy of other students, Aberli said that hasn\u2019t happened at Atherton. \"We have several transgender students now,\" he said. \"It\u2019s just kind of a non-issue.\" In March, Springfield Central High School in Massachusetts converted two single-user faculty bathrooms into two gender-neutral bathrooms, one each for faculty and students. Principal Thaddeus Tokarz said transgender students aren\u2019t required to use it, though some choose to do so. \"I believe we make it a point to have them use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with,\" Tokarz said. In Camas, Wash., across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore., Liberty Middle School Principal Marilyn Boerke said she was prepared for an onslaught of complaints from parents in the conservative district when the school adopted its policy in 2014, \"but it just didn\u2019t happen.\"  The 770-student school allows its five or so transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Only two parents objected, Boerke said. In response, Boerke told those parents that if their children were uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a trans student, they could opt to use another.  \"Part of that could be how our community at Liberty is really all about family,\" she said. \"We just don\u2019t accept that kind of intolerance.\" But the backlash is only beginning elsewhere. In Texas, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick has demanded the resignation of Kent Scribner, Fort Worth\u2019s school superintendent, over the district\u2019s transgender-inclusive bathroom policy. Patrick also argued for its repeal, calling it \"social engineering.\" Texas is leading a multistate lawsuit in federal court against the Obama administration\u2019s policy.  Last month, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Justice Department told schools across the country that Title IX of a 1972 federal education law protects transgender students from discrimination based on sex, including the use of bathrooms, locker rooms and showering facilities. The department reminded schools that those that did not comply with Title IX requirements risked losing federal funds.  In a Virginia case, a federal court agreed with the federal government and sided with a transgender student who challenged his school\u2019s policy that forces him to a bathroom that does not match his gender identity.  Nevertheless, Texas and 10 other states sued the Obama administration last month, with Mississippi, Kentucky and Kansas later joining the effort. This month, the Kansas Board of Education voted unanimously to oppose the Obama administration\u2019s policy, though the board will allow school districts to continue policies that accommodate transgender students. According to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network\u2019s 2013 School Climate Survey, transgender and gender-nonconforming students faced more hostility than lesbian, gay or bisexual students did. Four in 10 said they felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression. About half reported being verbally harassed, and about 1 in 5 reported being physically assaulted. The majority of students surveyed said they didn\u2019t report the harassment or assault to school officials because of doubt the staff would do anything about it or fear that it could make things worse. Some schools that have accommodated transgender students say the move has improved the learning environment. \"This was probably the best decision we made as a school all year,\" said Kevin Biggs, principal of Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa. Although he said students were always able to use the most appropriate bathroom for their needs, Biggs said a student visited him in November and explained that some transgender students didn\u2019t feel comfortable using the bathrooms that were available.  The school created two \"all-gender,\" single-stall restrooms in February. Students can still choose what works best for them. \"Those little things make a huge difference in a student\u2019s day they\u2019re distractions that can keep students from learning to their highest possible potential,\" Biggs said. \"We wanted to make that possible.\"  Student Alonzo Hernandez, 16, helped kick-start the process of creating a multi-stalled gender-neutral bathroom at the Santee Education Complex, a high school in Los Angeles, where he is a junior.  Hernandez is in transition from female to male, and his effort was driven, in part, by his own discomfort in using the school\u2019s existing bathrooms. He\u2019d sometimes avoid going to the bathroom the whole day to avoid harassment. \"There\u2019d be times when I would personally wait in the stall to make sure everyone in the bathroom was cleared out so I could come out of the stall,\" he said in an interview. The concerns weren\u2019t unfounded. Jose Lara, dean of students and faculty adviser for the Los Angeles school\u2019s gay-straight alliance, said the discussion generated a small but vocal protest. \"There were some protesters sending hate message to the students, telling them they are perverts, going to burn in hell, targeting the principal, saying he\u2019s a pedophile,\" Lara said. But ultimately, students, teachers and parents embraced the plan. \"The students wanted to have a voice, and they wanted to make a change, and they made a change,\" Lara said.", "A teacher's Facebook post explaining her reasoning for writing letters to more than 100 students has gone viral after she revealed she was left in tears by a parent's heartbreaking revelation. Brittni Darras, a teacher in Colorado, USA, posted two pictures of a table filled with the letters addressed to her pupils. They are clearly all unique, with Brittni taking the time to write bespoke messages to each young person. Explaining what motivated her, she wrote: \"Two months ago was the first time I cried during parent/teacher conferences. \"A mom of a student who I have taught for two years showed up at my table and proceeded to explain to me the reason for her daughter\u2019s extended absence. (Photo: Facebook) \"Her daughter - a friendly, intelligent, beautiful, driven, young woman - not only planned to commit suicide, but was in the act of doing so when the police broke in and stopped her. \"She had deleted her social media accounts and left goodbye letters; she was ready to leave the world.\" Brittni explains that she and the girl's mother both had tears streaming down their faces as they talked. To combat her helpless feeling, the teacher asked if she could write a letter to the student at the hospital, and was told that she would love that. \"My student got the letter; her mom said that her daughter cried, turned to her mom and said: 'How could somebody say such nice things about me? I didn't think anybody would miss me if I was gone.' (Photo: Getty) \"It made me realise that I was way too close to losing another student to suicide. I spent the next two months writing cards to every one of my students - over 100 of them - telling each one what is special and unique about them.\" Brittni goes on to say that she believes suicide is becoming more and more common because of the pressure we put on kids to be successful. to fit in or to be the best. She ends her note with a lesson for us all, saying: \"We need to remember that each human being is unique and that is what makes them special. \"Instead of trying to change it, we need to embrace it, because together, we can make a difference, and we can save lives! #suicideawareness.\" If you feel like you're struggling and need to talk to someone, Samaritans offer a free helpline around the clock, 365 days a year.

The 44-year-old health guru can rock a bikini like nobody's business, not to mention her flawless complexion and radiant blonde locks. The mom-of-two has spoken a lot about her fitness routine, diets, and cleanses over the years, some quotes more relatable than others, but each valuable in their own right. In honor of Paltrow landing on our February cover, here, we rounded up her best quotes on health, fitness, and general wellness from over the years. On Her Famous Cleansing Routines \"I like to do a cleanse once a year. But it's not just juices. And I don't do it for weight loss,\" she once said. On Making Time for Her Daughter \"I'll probably get kicked out of our school for admitting this, but I let Apple stay home yesterday. I just needed to be with her.

On Processed Food \"Anything that can live on a shelf for years and you can open out of a bag and eat: no,\" she once said. On Cheat Days \"In my house, the food is healthy. But we have ice cream, and once a week, on the way to school, we stop at the corner shop in London and I let them pick out whatever they want. They get a bag of crisps or candy and a soda. It's called the Coke of the Week. I don't want them growing up in a hippie vacuum,\" she once told Redbook. On Motherhood and Being Mindful \"I've learned so much from being a mom about the kind of person I want to be, the kind of woman I want to be. Motherhood has taught me mindfulness. If you just parent on instinct, you'll screw your kid up for life. You have to be so mindful,\" she told Good Housekeeping.

It's not like you're doing this every day.' So I really let everything go. And after, I thought, I wish I could get to this place every day, at least for a little while,\" she told Self. On Keeping Life in Balance \"I try to eat organic food when I can, eat local food when I can, and eat as little processed food as possible. But, sometimes you need a bag of Doritos and a beer in an airport. We have to be modern and easy on ourselves as well,\" she told InStyle. On Her Ideal Last Meal \"Oysters and cocktail sauce, and then a baked, stuffed lobster and french fries. I would have a baguette and a cheese course for my dessert, and red wine. I drank like crazy .

Last night's Food Unwrapped on Channel 4 revealed the correct way to store everyday store cupboard essentials, from bread to coffee. And it turns out the fridge isn't always the best place to keep your food, even when it comes to fresh vegetables. If you want your tomatoes to taste the best they possibly can, don't store them in the fridge, according to food safety expert Holly Jefferys. Though disputed by some, she said that the 'taste and texture' is affected by keeping them in cool conditions. However keeping tomatoes in the fridge does make them last longer, so it's up to you whether or not you want tasty tomatoes or want them to last as long as possible. But Polly recommends taking them out of the fridge 24 hours before you plan to use them.  The show, which airs every Monday at 8.30pm, also looked into the best ways to store bread and coffee. Could their taste or freshness be improved by storing them in the fridge? The answer was a resolute no - so stop putting these products in the fridge if you've been doing so up until now. Bread goes stale very quickly if you put it in the fridge, according to Holly. As for coffee, it depends what your packet says. If it advises you to keep it in the fridge, then do so, otherwise keep it in an airtight container. But when co-presenter Matt Tebbut did a taste test, he found that the coffee which had been kept in a container out of the fridge tasted like 'freshly brewed coffee', while the coffee which had been kept in the fridge did not. That's because the aromas of other food in the fridge can muddy the flavours of the coffee.  Food Unwrapped airs on Monday nights on Channel 4 at 8.30pm.

There are virtually no rules when it comes to socks, so bold colors and patterns with a suit or casual wear work no matter what else you're wearing on top or bottom. It's not just specific retailers cashing in on the sock craze anymore. \"Early on you could really find novelty socks (only) in some of the better specialty and department stores, but over the past years, the reason why it's grown is because you can get them anywhere from Target to the department stores. It's now become a very commercialized commodity item,\" said Cohen. But there still are plenty of boutiques and specialty online retailers that specialize only in selling socks. BoldSocks.com is one example. The online retailer was started in 2011 as a fun competition between friends Ryan Preisner and Adam Whitmore. At the time, they didn't expect to have a brilliant business plan on their hands, but they have since expanded to two brands, Statement Sockwear and BoldSocks, as a way to keep up with consumer demand for socks with unique patterns and colors. \"Our first year's sales, in most people's minds, were quite pathetic, but we have seen nonstop growth ever since. Our forecasted sales this year will likely exceed 26,000 percent growth over our first year's sales,\" said Ryan Roff, co-founder of Statement Sockwear.", "Image: Getty As you probably already know, the World Scrabble Championship 2016 final took place on Saturday.

TMZ reports Bieber was booted from Hotel Faena in Buenos Aires because his fans, who have been camped outside all week, were damaging hotel property. Photos previously surfaced of Beliebers in Argentina getting rowdy and tearing down the barricades outside the pop star's hotel set up to control the crowds. Other hotels purportedly didn't want to take in the 19-year-old singer, either, knowing the hoards of fans would follow. When contacted by E! News, Hotel Faena reps said Bieber was no longer staying there but would not say if they kicked him out or not. The crowds were certainly crazy. Bieber's video producer pal, Alfredo Flores, posted a photo to Instagram showing their hotel surrounded.

The current word on the street is that the iPhone 7, expected this fall, is going to be fairly boring. Instead, the next exciting iPhone will come out in 2017, and it could have several new features, like wireless charging, an edge-to-edge screen, and better camera all wrapped up in a glass body. Catcher Technology makes some of the aluminum shells for the iPhone 6. So its CEO, Allen Horng, might have inside information on Apple's chassis plans. And on Thursday, he said: \"As far as I know, only one [iPhone] model will adopt glass casing next year,\" after Catcher's annual shareholder meeting, Nikkei reports. He continued: \"I don't think this move will have an impact on Catcher's revenue, as glass casing still needs a durable metal frame, which requires advanced processing technology and would not be cheaper than the current model.\" As Nikkei points out, one-third of Catcher's revenue comes from Apple, so it's a critical customer for the company. Before the iPhone 6 came out, with its Catcher-supplied case, company revenues ballooned. Apple blog Patently Apple speculates that Horng's comment means that Apple might come out with a \"special anniversary\" or \"pro model.\" And reliable Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who has sources in the Apple supply chain, has tipped the possibility of a new \"Pro\" tier of iPhone recently. Apple's iPhone has followed a \"tick-tock\" cycle in recent years. In one year, it gets a new design, and in the other, Apple upgrades its internals. A growing amount of evidence points to Apple planning to change to that cycle in 2017.", "The teen birthrate has plummeted rapidly since the mid-2000s \u2014 and a new study suggests better use of birth control is entirely responsible. There are 42 percent fewer teen births now than just seven years ago. In 2007, 4.2 percent of teenage girls in the United States gave birth. In 2014, the rate was 2.4 percent. This is an incredibly fast change in a public health trend, and it\u2019s left some researchers puzzled over how it happened so quickly. But researchers Laura Lindberg, John Santelli, and Sheila Desai say it\u2019s not a mystery at all. Writing in the Journal of Adolescent Health, they find that teenage girls in 2012 were just as likely to be sexually active as girls in 2007. Survey research shows that 43 percent of girls between 15 and 19 said they\u2019d ever had sex in 2007, compared with 45 percent in 2012. What changed was how teenage girls used contraceptives. The percentage of sexually active teens who used at least one type of birth control the last time they had sex rose from 78 percent in 2007 to 86 percent in 2012. More teens gravitated toward better types of birth control \u2014 like pills, IUDs, or implants \u2014 rather than relying on lower-quality birth control like condoms. This study only included data through 2012, and, as the researchers note, it\u2019s possible the narrative could be changing. Newer data that runs through 2015 is starting to show a decline in sexual activity among teenage girls. \"It is unclear whether these new data represent a new trend or are the result of other factors,\" the study authors write of the new figures. But if this is the start of a decline in sexual activity among teenage girls, that suggests the steep declines in teen pregnancy might not just continue \u2014 they might reach new historic lows. Why over-the-counter birth control is so necessary", "Willem Dafoe is not a fan of Sony's \"Spider-Man\" reboot, \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\" Dafoe, who starred as Norman Osborn (a.k.a. Green Goblin) in Sam Raimi's 2002 film about the young webslinger, told Total Film that he was disappointed to see the studio take another crack at the character. \"I saw a trailer for the first Spider-Man reboot and I thought, 'This is crazy! It's not shot for shot, but it's the same story,'\" Dafoe said. \"I thought, 'This is sort of a cynical approach to making money!'\" Indeed, while there were some major differences between 2002's \"Spider-Man\" and 2012's \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" -- notably, that Spider-Man fights The Lizard instead of Green Goblin, and that Mary Jane doesn't appear -- the film's were largely structured the same, owing to the fact that \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" was yet another origin story for the character. Dafoe isn't the first \"Spider-Man\" actor to question the existence of \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\" James Franco, who played Dafoe's onscreen son, Harry, in the film and its sequels, has gone on record twice before about his issues with director Marc Webb's reboot. \"I mean, they could have strayed a little bit more from the original,\" Franco said to MTV in January of this year. \"It's like, 'Why?' Well, I guess they made a lot of money. Congrats. Good for them. Sam and I moved on, we made 'Oz The Great And Powerful.'\" In a piece published by Vice in June, Franco wrote that the 2012 Spider-Man reboot was made \"before there was time to bury the corpse of the old one and enshroud it in the haze of nostalgia.\" In fact, of the original \"Spider-Man\" participants, only Raimi himself has come out in favor of \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\" \"I loved it,\" Raimi told the website Hey U Guys back in March of this year. \"Of course the next Spider-Man story should be told, and [Marc Webb] did a wonderful job telling that. I loved the movie, and I'm looking forward like a fan to the next installment. I love the comic book, and now I don't feel bound, and I'm really glad somebody's remaking it again.\" For more from Dafoe, head to Total Film.

Premium food, premium services and shows and entertainment worthy of Las Vegas are all just part of the deal when you book a cruise. Normally, when you\u2019re arranging a cruise, you expect to pay a significant price for the luxury of fine dining and entertainment at sea \u2013 and most cruise passengers are paying substantially. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. In the last few years the economy has made it difficult for many couples and families to travel much farther than their own backyards. This coupled with the fact that many cruise companies have built magnificent new ships complete with every amenity under the sun means you have a golden opportunity for discount cruise prices. Cruise liners are huge and they have tremendous amounts of space available for passengers. Would-be passengers are waiting for the economy to improve. This leaves you in the position to maximize on those unsold cabins by snatching up a once-in-a-lifetime cruise experience with huge discounts. You might only pay 20% of what other ship passengers are paying simply because you know the best ways to find cruise deals on the Internet. Best Cruise Prices Online You won\u2019t find the biggest savings and cruise deals on the typical travel websites that you see advertised on television. You have to dig a bit deeper to find a company that knows this industry inside and out. Often there are terrific deals on last minute cruise arrangements as well as opportunities to book vacations well in advance to take advantage of special events and opportunities \u2013 including luxury sailings on brand new, deluxe ships to destinations like the Caribbean, Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii, the Mediterranean and many others. Spending Less On Your Cruise Building a cruise liner costs a lot of money, and the owners of these ships don\u2019t want them to sail without recouping some of their costs. They are willing to practically give the cabin space and cruise experience away if it means having more people on the ship. But these steep discounts aren\u2019t offered to everyone. Some cruise lines offer up unsold inventory for up to 70 percent off the listed prices. These deals are often only allowed through authorized partners, so you need to search for the best opportunity. While the economy starts to recover, the cruise industry will take much longer to reach full capacity again. That means you still have time to book an amazing trip aboard a luxury ocean liner on just about any budget. Interested in the possibilities? Search now to see what amazing deals you can find!", "Jay Z is finally speaking out about Beyonce\u2019s album, Lemonade.

Madelynn Taylor and her wife, Jean Mixner, were inseparable for 17 years, until Mixner passed away two years ago. After Mixner's death, Taylor went to the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery, where her brother and sister are also buried, and requested to be buried next to her wife's ashes when the times comes, according to Idaho news outlet KTVB. Though the cemetery normally permits veterans and their spouses to be buried next to one another, the Idaho Division of Veterans Services denied Taylor's application because the state refuses to recognize her marriage. \"I'm not surprised,\" Taylor told Idaho news outlet KBOI. \"I've been discriminated against for 70 years, and they might as well discriminate against me in death as well as life.\" Taylor grew up in a military family. She joined the Navy in 1958 and served for six years. She and Mixner met on a blind date in 1995, and the two quickly fell madly in love, then formally married in California in 2008. Despite their California marriage license, Idaho does not recognize their union under the state's Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman. Neither does the state recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. Here's what the Idaho Constitution has to say about marriage equality: \"A marriage between a man and a woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state.\" \"We have to follow the state law, and the state law, you know well,\" Idaho Division of Veterans Services Deputy Administrator Tamara Mackenthun told KTVB of Taylor's predicament. But Taylor won't lose sight of her goal to be buried in the veterans' cemetery with her partner. She recently joined up with gay rights advocacy group Add The Words to campaign against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender discrimination and to change the state's laws. \"I just feel that it's the right place for me. You know, I'm a veteran. So they should let me ... in fact they would let me alone, be in that crypt,\" Taylor told KTVB. \"But I don't want to alone.

After learning about the toxic ingredients found in countless cosmetics, Paltrow revealed she didn't rest until she and her team of chemists were able to formulate quality skincare that could end the stigma surrounding organic beauty products only being for hippies. \"We're here to change that and say that the modern, sophisticated woman who has a very high standard in skincare also deserves a product that is as good for the body as it is for the skin,\" she said.

We want balanced hormones, we want to be fertile, and then we're imbibing all of these toxins that are throwing off our natural hormonal system.

The six-piece line -- which includes a cleanser, scrub, daytime moisturizer, night cream, face oil and eye cream -- is formulated with skin-nourishing oils that soothe and brighten dull, dry complexions, food-grade preservatives (which Jimmy Fallon put to a taste test) and plant-based cellulose beads that gently remove dead skin cells.

Early in the third quarter in Philadelphia, the 32-year-old wideout attempted to catch a pass from Philip Rivers and was then wrapped up from behind by Eagles safety Nate Allen. With Allen pushing Floyd from behind, his momentum carried him into a hard hit from Eagles linebacker DeMeco Ryans. Floyd's head was down and Ryan appeared to be leading with his shoulder as the three players came together. The ball dropped for an incomplete pass and Floyd went down with a potentially serious injury. Floyd remained down on the field for several minutes before he was strapped to a stretcher. Players from both teams gathered around as Floyd was attended to by medical personnel. He was then placed in an ambulance for transport to a local hospital. He moved his legs and fingers before being placed into the ambulance, reported Kevin Acee of U-T San Diego. He was officially ruled out with a neck injury, according to Ricky Henne of Chargers.com. Following his team's 33-30 win, Chargers coach Mike McCoy shared some positive news about Floyd. \"All the tests right now look good, so it's great for the organization to go out and get a win for Malcom,\" McCoy told reporters, via The Associated Press.", "Craig and Mary Romney may have been in the political eye for a while, but today we're focusing on the duo's incredible eye for design.

The Animal Legal Defense Fund released its 11th annual report on animal protection rankings on Tuesday. Illinois topped the list of best protections for the ninth consecutive year, followed by Oregon, Maine , California and Rhode Island. Kentucky came in dead last for the 10th straight year. Other states with weak animal protection laws include Iowa (49th), Wyoming (48th), Utah (47th) and North Dakota (46th). Lora Dunn, the senior staff attorney of the Animal Legal Defense Fund\u2019s Criminal Justice Program, said the organization looked at 15 distinct categories of animal protection laws in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. \"We would like to see Kentucky make some very important changes to make sure that animals are protected now and in the future from known offenders,\" Dunn said in an interview with Yahoo News. According to Dunn, Kentucky falls short in terms of its felony penalties for animal cruelty: There is no consequence for neglect, sexual assault or abandonment of an animal, for instance. \"We\u2019d really like to see the punishment fit the crime in those situations,\" she told Yahoo News. \"Kentucky is the only state in the country that specifically prohibits veterinarians from reporting animal cruelty. The majority of states either allow or require by law that veterinarians who suspect animal cruelty to report it to law enforcement.\" Additionally, she said, Kentucky is the only state that doesn\u2019t require that animals be forfeited from a convicted offender\u2019s custody after he or she has been convicted. She said statistics show that someone who has harmed animals is more likely to hurt animals again in the future and to hurt humans as well. On the other end of the spectrum, Dunn said, Illinois remains on top because there are felony penalties covering virtually every kind of mistreatment, including abuse, neglect, fighting, sexual assault and abandonment. Across the country, the Animal Legal Defense Fund has largely seen positive changes regarding animal safety. Wisconsin was the most-improved state of the year, jumping 14 places in rank, from the bottom tier to number 30 overall. This was partly thanks to a new cost-of-care law. \"We\u2019re seeing very encouraging trends regarding animal protection legislation. In particular, we\u2019re seeing a trend regarding cost-of-care laws,\" she said. These mandate that [when] care-giving agencies that come to the rescue to help animals in need \u2014 that have been seized as part of a criminal investigation \u2014 the cost and burden of caring for those animals lies with the offender.\" In other words, comprehensive cost-of-care laws place the financial responsibility of caring for an animal squarely with the person who has harmed it. Dunn said there\u2019s also been a promising trend regarding \"dogs in hot cars laws,\" which criminalize leaving an animal in a hot car and affirms the right of other people to save these animals in certain circumstances. The rescue provisions kick in \"after calling 911, after having a good faith belief that these animals are in danger and after taking other steps to notify the owner,\" she said. \"More than 20 states have passed laws that allow citizens to come to the rescue of these animals in really dangerous situations.\" The Animal Legal Defense Fund\u2019s annual rankings are based on a review of each jurisdiction\u2019s animal protection laws, which include more than 4,000 pages of statutes.", "Smartphones design has evolved a lot in recent times with several manufacturers such as Apple, Motorola, Google, HTC, Sony taking the initiatives in manufacturing a good looking smartphone. The trend these days have been the unibody metal design which is becoming the next plastic thing for the smartphones. There are a lot of smartphones ranging from flagship to entry-level segment to come with the metal body. We are speaking about only the metal bodied smartphones. But why? Because the metal body smartphones usually have stripes on their back. We don't say all of them have the stripes over the back, but most of the smartphones have that and the other metal body smartphone have this stripes along their sides. You might be wondering on what does these stripes indicate, right? Well, look after the sliders below to know more the white lines. What Actually Are Those White Lines? The answer to this question is a simple one. The White Lines on all metal bodied smartphones are 'Antenna Bands'. Antenna Bands are the things usually the antenna in radios or other electronic devices which convert the electric power signals to radio signals and vice versa. This is bit technical. In simple words, the antenna bands are used to receive and transmit signals. Who Started This? Previously, there used to some other design policy where the antenna bands are not visible, however, it is worth noticing that the old age smartphones didn't use metal to build on. Instead, there are iPhones with glass on front and back. Now, this White lines trend was started by Apple with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Soon, it was followed by other manufacturers. It is worth noticing that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were heavily criticised for their design language. Are they harmful? Absolutely, No. They are just antenna bands to send and receive signals. According to us, manufacturers designed in that manner to make the smartphone look better. Followed by? Apple always leads from the front in innovating and they are the same with this. Following the footprints of Apple, there are many manufacturers such as OnePlus, HTC, Meizu, etc who added the same design language to their smartphones. However, some of them look really good such as the OnePlus 3, Meizu MX6. Asus Manufactured the Invisible Band Smartphone Asus is the first manufacturer who launched a metal smartphone with invisible bands. The ZenFone 3 Series are the first smartphones in the world to launch with invisible bands even with the metal body.", "New York nightspot 54 Below is set to welcome back one of its inaugural stars when Brian d'Arcy James takes the stage Sept. 5. Though he's predominately known as a song-and-dance man, the two-time Tony Award nominee (\"Sweet Smell of Success,\" \"Shrek the Musical\") will mostly eschew showtunes in favor of rock and pop songs for \"Under The Influence,\" an eclectic \"hodgepodge\" show that he premiered at 54 Below to great acclaim last year, shortly after the club opened. \"I've always said this endeavor was a bit of a selfish one,\" James, 45, said in an interview with The Huffington Post, noting that the 2013 version of his set will comprises tunes by Billy Joel, Steve Winwood and Squeeze. \"Since it was the first time I've really put together an official show of my own, I gravitated towards the music that I grew up listening to, which is predominately a traditional pop sound.\" James' renditions of pop-rock tunes earned him raves during his 2012 engagement: The New York Times said the show \"sharpened [his] profile as an energetic closet rocker,\" while TheaterMania's Brian Scott Lipton praised the star's \"delicious looseness.\" But the actor is most excited to perform the \"good old-fashioned country waltz\" he co-wrote with longtime musical director Dan Lipton -- it's called \"Don't Hold it Against Me,\" and it was written for James' wife, Jennifer Prescott. \"Any time I get the chance -- and the courage -- to sing one of my own songs, I like that very much,\" James said. He went on to describe the advantages of performing in an intimate cabaret setting as opposed to a large-scale Broadway theater. \"You're allowed to be yourself and you're not beholden to a particular character or story,\" he said. \"I like that aspect of not having a mask on; I like that liberty. Every song is a story, of course, but I think just in terms of how I approach this ... I like being able to be just as concerned with the sound of a song [as] the story of a song.\" He is reluctant to speculate on the reasons behind the recent demise of \"Smash,\" the Broadway-centric NBC series that premiered amid dynamite buzz last year but never found an audience. \"It's easy to play armchair quarterback once something is over,\" James, who starred as Frank, the emotional if somewhat obeisant husband of lyricist Julia Houston (Debra Messing). \"I honestly can't tell you why it didn't work in the end in terms of having a longer life.\" He nonetheless praised the efforts of the show's \"amazing\" ensemble cast, which included fellow Manhattan theater veterans Megan Hilty, Christian Borle, Jeremy Jordan and Andy Mientus, among others. \"Just because it didn't have three seasons instead of two doesn't mean that everyone wasn't trying 300 percent to make the best show possible,\" he said. While James is hopeful another \"Smash\"-like television stint will come his way, his stage career remains in high gear. The cast recording of the Public Theater's \"Giant,\" in which James starred last fall, was recently released to great fanfare. Earlier this month, the actor also reportedly took part in a staged workshop of \"Finding Neverland,\" a musical version of the Academy Award-nominated 2004 film that producers hope to bring to Broadway and London's West End next year. Noting that \"waiting for the chips to fall\" is simply a standard part of an actor's life, James nonetheless said that he is most interested \"in getting an opportunity to create new roles, particularly in musical theater. That, to me, is the most thrilling and most satisfying.\"", "Blood has many roles in the metaphorical life of the human body. It\u2019s the organ of kinship (\"blood ties\"), the seat of emotion (\"blood lust\") and a vehicle for identity (\"travel is in his blood\"). But might it also be a window on the body\u2019s fate? Many scientists are trying to answer that question as a practical matter, not a metaphor. They are scouring the blood for biomarkers \u2014 easily measured substances that illuminate what\u2019s going on in hard-to-reach places. Biomarkers aren\u2019t new to medicine. Many lab tests are, in fact, tests of biomarkers. Sugar or protein in a sample of urine can shed light on what\u2019s happening in the kidneys or pancreas. The concentration of cholesterol in the blood may hint at disease in the arteries. What\u2019s changed is medicine\u2019s ability to measure more molecules, with greater precision and less cost, than was possible in the past. The result is a storehouse of information on millions of people, most of it available at the prick of a hypodermic needle. When the health and longevity of those people are correlated with the readings of their biomarkers, it becomes possible to find biomarker profiles that predict risk of future disease or early death. A recent attempt to do just that was described this year in the journal Aging Cell by Paola Sebastiani, a biostatistician at the Boston University School of Public Health. Her subjects were members of the Long Life Family Study \u2014 5,000 people in 550 families with a predilection for longevity. The volunteers in the study were subjected to many blood tests. Sebastiani and her colleagues focused on 19 that proved to be most informative. The tests included common ones (hemoglobin concentration, serum albumin) and exotic ones (C-reactive protein, insulinlike growth factor). Together, the tests shed light on six domains of physiology, including inflammation, kidney function and blood-sugar metabolism. A computer algorithm analyzed the test results in the thousands of volunteers and determined that they fell into 26 patterns, or clusters. Each cluster contained people with similar test results. The biggest one had 2,200 people, all of whom had test readings close to the average for the whole study population. They became the reference group. \"The methodology that I used is to look at multiple markers simultaneously, which is challenging. You have to have a lot of data to be able to do this,\" Sebastiani said. The researchers found the clusters differed from each other, and from the reference group, in their rates of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and premature death, and also in measures of aging, such as grip strength and walking speed. As expected, one cluster was considerably healthier than the average, with a low incidence of disease and early death. Its members seemed to have biological ages younger than their chronological ages. In short, the 19 blood tests together formed a biomarker that told people whether they were aging prematurely, and predicted in general terms the chances of developing serious illness or dying early. Sebastiani and her team then looked to see whether the biomarkers worked in a different population. They chose the Offspring Cohort of the Framingham Heart Study \u2014 several thousand men and women who had had blood tests done periodically since the 1970s. The biomarkers held up. They divided that population into clusters with the same patterns of disease risk, premature aging and early death as seen in the Long Life Family Study. The research didn\u2019t address whether people could move from one biomarker cluster to another, and in so doing change their risk for a bad outcome. But Sebastiani suspects they can \u2014 and do. \"There are a lot of things you can do to improve biomarkers. They are not all hard-wired, like genetic mutations,\" she said. Such biomarker profiling would be useful in clinical trials of anti-aging treatments because it would allow researchers to measure the efficacy of a drug by seeing whether a person taking it shifted from a cluster with advanced biological age and elevated risk for disease, to a more youthful, lower-risk one. The more obvious use, however, is in the routine doctor visit, where it could provide patients a peek at what may lie ahead and a chance, Ebenezer Scroogelike, to alter their fates. There is, of course, much more in blood than what the Boston University researchers were looking at. For example, there are white blood cells containing thousands of genes in various states of activity. It turns out they, too, can be biomarkers. In a study published in 2009, Richard A. Kerber at the University of Louisville and two collaborators looked at 2,100 genes that are always turned on in cells, most of them doing molecular housekeeping. The researchers measured the amount of activity of each gene in blood samples drawn from about 100 people in the 1980s and then frozen. The people were 57 to 97 years old at the time. Even though all the genes were active, for many of them the amount of activity varied by a person\u2019s age. In all, 10 percent tended to become more active as a person got older, and 6 percent became less active. Using that information, the researchers were able to say what biological age based on gene activity looked like for each year of middle and old age. Many of the people had since died \u2014 a fact that allowed the researchers to calculate what the risk of death had been over the decades for people with various biological ages at the time the blood was drawn. It turned out that for every \"extra\" year of biological age, a person\u2019s risk of dying was about one-third higher than it would normally have been. For example, a 55-year-old with the gene-activity profile of a 56-year-old had a 33 percent greater risk of dying at age 55 than a 55-year-old person whose biological age matched his chronological age. As with the blood biomarkers, this one will probably be more useful as a signpost than as a crystal ball. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to be very accurate in terms of predicting how long someone is going to live,\" Kerber said. \"There are too many random factors; too much stuff can happen. But if it\u2019s monitored at several time points, it could tell you whether you\u2019re going in the right direction or not.\" Other ways of measuring gene activity are also proving to be useful gauges of disease risk and longevity, at least in research studies. Just last month, a team of scientists led by Yan Zhang at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg reported that a phenomenon called DNA methylation may be one. In methylation, a methyl group (a cluster of one carbon and three hydrogen atoms) attaches to the DNA strand, repressing the gene at that spot. Patterns of methylation are strongly influenced by age, sex, and environmental and lifestyle exposures, including smoking and exercise. Methylation also plays a role in the onset and course of many chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes and autoimmune disorders. The German team found that specific methylation patterns at just 10 sites (out of thousands), when measured in people in their 60s, strongly predicted a person\u2019s risk of dying over the next 10 years. So, blood biomarkers that predict longevity \u2014 hemo-augury, you might call it \u2014 are a hot topic in medical research. But can they tell us anything useful that we don\u2019t already know? Various studies have shown that genes are responsible for only 30 percent of our longevity. The other 70 percent is determined by diet, exercise, weight, habits such as smoking and drinking, family and social life, along with access to medical care, and luck. How much difference \u00adnongenetic factors can make is evident in the experience of \u00adSeventh-Day Adventists. The members of that Christian sect don\u2019t smoke or drink, tend to be vegetarians and have strong family and church-community bonds. Life expectancy is 86 for Adventist men and 89 for of Adventist women, compared with 76 for American men overall and 81 for American women. Adventists come from many ethnic and racial backgrounds, so the big increase in longevity is presumably the consequence of behavior, not genes. \"What that says is that we humans have, on average, a genetic blueprint that allows us to get to a very old age,\" said Thomas T. Perls, a geriatrician at Boston University who directs a study of very old people called the New England Centenarian Study. \"If we take advantage of that blueprint, we get to almost 90. If we fight it, then we\u2019re going to die in our 50s or 60s.\" Biomarkers that hint at our chances for a long life are scientifically interesting. Perls\u2019s research, for example, has found that people who live to age 105 share many rare variants of just 130 genes out of the 20,000 they all carry. But as a practical matter, we don\u2019t need to wait for \u00adhemo-augury to show up at our doctor\u2019s office. We already know what to do to make ourselves healthier.

Fixr, an online network for small businesses, rounded up the top ten steepest streets in the U.S. into one neat infographic, causing a stir of debate among seasoned travelers, ambitious cyclists and opinionated hill-climbers. San Francisco, it turns out, barely made the cut, clinging on to the number nine and ten spots, while the number one spot was handed to a restricted access road in Hawaii. The Big Island's cliffside road climbs up 800 feet in just six-tenths of a mile. It is so steep that access is restricted to 4-wheel drive vehicles and people on foot, making its inclusion debatable. While it's hard to believe that the ten steepest roads in America can only be found in three states (seven in California, two in Pennsylvania, and one in Hawaii), it's equally hard to argue with any of their heart-pounding inclines. 1.

When it comes to grooming, we slather and lather beauty products onto our skin in an effort to look better and smell fresher. But what exactly is the true cost of our vanity?  Chances are, once your products go down the drain you don\u2019t stop and think about what could be in them. Or maybe you did when microbeads \u2013 the small pieces of plastic in facial scrubs and makeup \u2013 made headlines last year.  Now, a new ingredient is coming under fire; 1,4-dioxane.  Found in everything from body washes to hand soaps and lotions, the Environmental Protection Agency claims it is a likely carcinogen. But despite that, it\u2019s still found in a shocking 46 per cent of products and brands aren\u2019t even required to list it on the label. What\u2019s more, it has an EWG (Environmental Working Group) score of 8 \u2013 10 being the most toxic \u2013 and is already banned in Canada.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers accountant Brian Cullinan was supposed to hand the best picture envelope to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway on Sunday. In a statement, PwC said he \"mistakenly handed [them] the back-up envelope for actress in a leading role instead.\" It's also emerged that Cullinan tweeted a picture of Emma Stone backstage just minutes before the mix-up took place. The tweet has since been deleted, though it survives on various websites and on a cached Google page. Cullinan had a complete set of envelopes on one side of the stage, while Martha Ruiz, another PwC accountant, had a duplicate set on the other. This explains why both best actress winner Emma Stone and Beatty ended up in possession of an envelope related to the best actress award. Beatty was evidently confused by the contents of the envelope, passing the card onto his former Bonnie and Clyde co-star. Seeing the words \"La La Land\" beneath Emma Stone's name, Dunaway declared her musical romance the winner of the best picture award. Only after that film's producers had begun their acceptance speeches was it revealed that Moonlight had in fact won the award. \"Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr Cullinan or his partner,\" said the accountancy firm. One of Cullinan's colleagues told Variety that the accountant \"feels very, very terrible\" and \"is very upset about this mistake\". The mix-up brought a chaotic end to Sunday's Oscars ceremony, hosted in Los Angeles by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. Here are six more things we've learned about one of the most extraordinary awards show debacles in recent times. 1) The Academy is really, really sorry The organisers of the Academy Awards \"deeply regret the mistakes\" that led to La La Land being wrongly named best picture. Moonlight had actually won the award, but the envelope mix-up led to Dunaway announcing the wrong film. \"We apologise to the entire cast and crew of La La Land and Moonlight whose experience was profoundly altered by this error,\" the Academy said. \"We salute the tremendous grace they displayed under the circumstances.\" In its statement, the Academy said PwC had \"taken full responsibility for the breaches of established protocols that took place during the ceremony. \"We have spent last night and today investigating the circumstances, and will determine what actions are appropriate going forward.\" 2) It was all down to Trump President Trump and his policies were at the forefront of many attendees' minds on Sunday, with Gael Garcia Bernal among those to take issue with them on stage. \"As a Mexican, as a Latin-American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I'm against any form of wall that separates us,\" the actor said - a reference to Trump's plans to build a border wall between Mexico and the US. In his first comments on the Oscars, the president has suggested the awards \"were focused so hard on politics that they didn't get the act together at the end\". \"It was a little sad,\" he told the right-wing Breitbart website. \"It took away from the glamour of the Oscars. It didn't feel like a very glamorous evening. \"I've been to the Oscars,\" continued the president. \"There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad.\" 3) It didn't help the ratings The extraordinary end to Sunday's ceremony came too late to help boost the show's ratings, which were its smallest for almost 10 years. ABC's broadcast drew 32.9 million viewers in the US - a 4 per cent drop on the 2016 Oscars, which were seen by 34.4 million people. It was the smallest audience since the 2008 ceremony, which drew an average audience of 32 million. Despite the decline, the Oscars are still expected to be the most-watched non-sporting event on US TV this year. 4) Kimmel was meant to end the show with Matt Damon Back in his usual slot on late night television, Jimmy Kimmel revealed that he had originally intended to end the show in the audience, sat next to actor Matt Damon. \"We're sitting there and we notice some commotion going on,\" the Oscars host explained on Monday's edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live. \"And Matt says, 'I think I heard the stage manager say they got the winner wrong.' \"So you just kind of, well, the host will go onstage and clear this up. And then I remember, oh, I'm the host.\" \"Have any of you here ever hosted the Oscars before?\" Kimmel asked his audience. \"Well, except for the end - it was a lot of fun.'' The result, he joked, \"was the weirdest TV finale since Lost\" - a reference to the long-running US drama series about strangers stranded on a tropical island. 5) Faye Dunaway's heels may have been involved According to Tuesday's Daily Mail, Beatty and Dunaway were meant to have descended a staircase before presenting the final award of the evening. But the paper claims the 76-year-old had difficulty climbing up the stairs in her high heels, so the pair started their presentation walk at the foot of the stairs instead. \"It's unclear whether this confusion contributes to the ensuing chaos,\" the paper's report continues. 6) The US State Department also had Twitter issues The US State Department's official Persian-language Twitter account tweeted congratulations to the Iranian people and Asghar Farhadi after the director's film The Salesman won the best foreign language film award. That was despite Farhadi, who did not attend the ceremony, having a speech read out in which he described President Trump's travel ban as \"inhumane\". A State department spokeswoman said the tweet was deleted \"to avoid any misperception that the USG [US government] endorsed the comments made in the acceptance speech.\"", "16 days ago 8 Shares Credit: HBO Spoilers, I suppose.

Words Patrick Hulbert", "As \"Mad Men\"s costume designer and the producer of a design-inspired reality show, Janie Bryant could probably teach us a lot about fashion. But Bryant already has a pupil in mind: Hillary Clinton. Though we doubt the former senator with a proclivity for pantsuits asked for any advice. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Bryant reveals her hopes for Hillary: \"Hillary Clinton could have an amazing fashion update,\" said Bryant... Candidate Clinton, she said, \"could look totally dynamic, professional and serious all at the same time with beautiful blouses and skirts as opposed to the safe-pantsuit look.\" Bryant isn't the first to chime in for Hillary to change her wardrobe; Tim Gunn once famously said of the politician, \"I think she's confused about her gender\" and Bravo's Andy Cohen quipped that she should have a TV show called \"Project Pantsuit.\" Now, for our two cents that nobody asked for: Let Hillary live! Clinton has found a silhouette that works for her, and she's sticking to it -- a tip we recommend to our closest friends. For some women, that's a fit-and-flare dress. For others, it's a little black number. And for Hillary, it's a pantsuit. \"Women in politics play it very safe,\" Bryant told WWD. \"As a designer, I feel they could still be taken seriously without being so conservative.\" Fair enough, Janie -- but let's leave the pattern-clashing to Michelle Obama for now.", "During a long day at work, a man stumbled across a white styrofoam box that was almost buried in the snow. It was out in the wilderness, miles away from houses, and covered in branches. It's a miracle he even noticed it. What was inside the box broke his heart. You can barely see the box here. It blends in with the snow. Even close up, it just looks like a piece of garbage that might have blown in from the road. When he looked inside the box, he saw this depressing scene for the first time: a freezing kitten, shivering next to its frozen food. Behind the first kitten, another kitten huddled close to her brother. Keep in mind: this was out in the middle of nowhere. The kittens had been dumped there, all alone, to slowly die in the cold. He grabbed the box and was determined to help the kittens survive. The cat at the back of the box was sick, but not in as bad shape as her brother. The other cat was in a very bad way. It's likely he would not have survived much longer. The kittens were so traumatized that they were terrified to be without each other and would cry out when they were separated. The cats desperately needed medical attention, but, first, they needed to just make it through the night. Warm blankets helped to raise their body temperatures. They responded so well to their human rescuers; they purred like crazy whenever they were held. The healthier kitten would purr and nuzzle anyone who would let her. The other cat was still in terrible condition, but he did survive the night and made it to the vet as soon as possible. These kittens are well on the road to recovery! It is amazing that these kittens have been through so much and seen so much cruelty in their tiny lives. But it's equally miraculous that they are loving and trusting of their rescuers. What a great, happy ending for these two.", "NBC\u2019s Olympics nightmare has all but come true: Prime-time viewership for Rio is down 17% from the London Games in 2012. At a conference in June, NBC CEO Steve Burke explained what would constitute an Olympics \"nightmare,\" Bloomberg reports. \"We wake up someday and the ratings are down 20%,\" he said. \"If that happens, my prediction would be that millennials had been in a Facebook bubble or a Snapchat bubble and the Olympics have come, and they didn't know it.\" That nightmare is basically here, as the Olympics saw a sharp viewership dip for the first time since 2000. Among 18- to 49-year-olds, the damage is even greater than 20%, sitting at a 25% drop-off, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That's bad news for NBC, which paid $12 billion to lock up the rights to the Olympics through 2032. There is, however, a slight silver lining. About 24% more people have streamed the Rio Olympics through NBC's app and website than streamed the London Games over the same period. NBC told Bloomberg that 78 million unique users had streamed the games through Tuesday. And NBC has actually been able to charge 50% higher ad rates for internet ads than for those on TV because of the younger audience, NBC Sports chairman Mark Lazarus told Bloomberg. But that good news should be put into harsh perspective: 98% of people still watch the Olympics on TV, the medium that has seen its audience plummet.", "California has both the most ultra-wealthy individuals and the highest poverty rate of any U.S. state, according to recent reports. \"This chasm is growing day by day, year by year,\" Larry Gerston, professor of political science at San Jose State University, said to The Huffington Post. \"Those at the top in California are just as happy as a clam. Their incomes are going up much faster than anyone else's.\" In 2013, the Golden-for-some State was home to the most -- 12,560 -- ultra-wealthy individuals, according to a new report by Wealth-X, a think tank focusing on wealthy people. New York had the second most, with 8,945 ultra-wealthy individuals. Wealth-X defines ultra-wealthy as having a net worth of at least $30 million. California gained even more ultra-wealthy individuals in 2013 than any other state, adding an additional 1,605 residents. Florida gained the second most, an additional 565 more than in 2012. But California also has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau. Nearly one in four Californians -- about 24 percent of the overall population -- lives in poverty. Behind California, the District of Columbia and Nevada have the second and third highest poverty rates, according to the analysis. Across the U.S., about 16 percent of Americans live in poverty. The census analysis considered income, government benefits, taxes and cost of living. The official poverty threshold for a two-adult-two-child family was $23,283 in 2012. What to do about these grim statistics? For one, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in September the highest minimum wage in the nation, to be rolled out over the next three years. California's minimum wage will bump from $8 to $9 an hour in July 2014, and then up to $10 an hour in January 2016. Brown also fought tooth and nail last year to get voters to pass Proposition 30, which raises income taxes on the wealthiest Californians to help fund K-12 schools, community colleges and state universities. The measure is desperately needed, as California's education system ranks 36th in the nation, with a C grade, in Quality Count's 2013 report. California educates about one-eighth of the nation's students. But Prop 30 is just a temporary fix -- a \"band-aid,\" Gerston said. California's education system desperately needs more funds, and the state's poor need more social services. And getting initiatives passed that address these issues may prove to be an uphill battle, as Gerston pointed out. Part of the problem is that those at the bottom don't vote nearly as much as those at the top, Gerston said. In California, this is exacerbated because recent immigrants are even less likely to vote. But Gerston is optimistic that democracy will catch up with immigration. As more immigrants have been here for second and third generations, percentages of Latinos and Asian American voters have crept up, he said. \"You will see the legislature filled with more and more people reflecting the state's demographics,\" he said. \"The voting turnout will eventually be a majority of non-whites.\" And those non-whites and low-income Californians will vote in their own interest, as voters always do, Gerston said. \"Give this another 20 years, and you're going to see a state that's markedly different.\"", "Imagine living in an historic home that once hosted a former U.S. president and other government officials at the base of a gondola in one of Colorado's premier ski towns. This 1963 home built in Vail, Colo. at 332 Mill Creek Circle is Vail Village's most historic home. The 5-bedroom, 4-bathroom home was designed by Fitzhugh Scott, one of Vail's original town architects. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, President Gerald Ford, Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller and others have visited the home and even conducted a meeting inside to discuss the 1976 presidential election. In the photo below, President Ford conducts a meeting to discuss the 1976 presidential campaign while vacationing in Vail. Pictured from left to right: President Ford Committee Chairman James Baker; former Texas Governor John Connally; PFC Deputy Chairman for Political Affairs Stuart Spencer; Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller; President Ford; Counselor and Speechwriter Robert Hartmann among others: And the sitting room as it stands today: Remodeled in 2012, the home's location was handpicked by Scott and features an indoor pool, hot tub and gorgeous interior brick archways just a shot walk away from the Vail Village shops and restaurants. It was also Vail's very first home. Back in the 60s, Scott was in charge of the planning board that helped keep the village a walking center, keeping it free from the traffic congestion and noise of cars, and maintaining its integrity as a ski resort. It seems extremely fitting then, that the home offers ski-in and ski-out access at the base of Vail's new Gondola One ski lift. This little piece of Colorado history is listed on the market for $20 million.

I would sometimes even be late to school, because my ginger locks had to be pin-straight before I would leave the house. Now that I'm older and wiser (and lazier), I only use a flat iron once or twice a week. But when I heard about the heated brush that straightens your hair while you brush it, my life flashed before my eyes (I had so much spare time, my hair was beautifully straight and tangle-free, the world was my oyster!) and I had to try it. Head Kandy's Hair Straightening Brush is sleek, bright, and at $59.99, not terribly expensive as far as hot tools go. It has a little temperature control that can go up to 450 degrees and doesn't take too long to heat up, which is a bonus. After I gave my hair a quick comb with a regular brush (I wasn't sure if the heated brush could handle my day-old tangles), I grabbed the new tool to try. Before Since it was my first time using the brush, I was worried I'd burn myself, something that occurs way too often for someone whose been straightening and curling, for, like 10 years. But it has little rubber guards all around the heated metal bristles, so it's almost impossible (even for clumsy, clumsy me) to burn yourself. Plus, the little knobs make for one killer scalp massage. After a few minutes (I don't have that much hair), I was done. And my hair looked great! After, Angle 1 The brush worked exactly how the box claimed it would, except for the part I was most excited about: \"Cut straightening time in half.\" It wasn't any quicker than using my flat iron. If anything, it took more time, because it gave me a more naturally straight look and I have to have super straight strands, otherwise my short bob looks like a mom 'do. So in the end, I ended up spending more time trying to get my hair to look the way I wanted. After, Angle 2 Honestly, I don't know why I thought it would be quicker. You use the exact same motion to run a brush through your hair as you do to straighten it. After, Angle 3 Timing aside though, the brush did exactly what it promised. So if you're into hot tools that massage your scalp and deflect burns like nobody's business, definitely give it a try. And if you want to watch it in action, check out this vid (that's me in the stripes \ud83d\ude4b).", "Just about everyone knows that you should never text and drive, and that you should stop, drop, and roll if you catch on fire. But life can also throw situations at us that we don't have a quick, handy response for. Commenters in a recent Quora thread about life-saving facts offered their best tips, which are easy to remember and could have a huge effect if you ever find yourself in a dangerous situation. You might want to save these for later. Your brain can't handle walking and using your phone at the same time \u2014 so look up. Murali Krishnan says walking and using your phone both demand large amounts of cognitive effort. As a result, you can't fully focus on both at the same time in the same way you can with walking and gum-chewing, for instance. You could suffer \"inattention blindness,\" where you may see an object but not process that it's a car speeding toward you, Krishnan says. Eliminate your car's blind spots by adjusting your mirrors properly. Blind spots aren't inevitable in all vehicles, says Kristen Rush. By adjusting your mirrors so that you barely see the edges of your own car, you can effectively eliminate the blind spots on the sides of the vehicle, she says. The rear-view mirror should be able to locate any car behind yours. It's worth the few seconds it takes to adjust these when you get in the driver's seat. Heat transfers faster through liquid than gas, so keep warm by staying dry. There's a connection between being wet and getting cold, says engineer Ian Lavoie. To ensure your body temperature doesn't fall too quickly in cold environments, invest in clothes made of wool instead of cotton \u2014 they'll absorb more moisture so that dampness doesn't linger on your skin. And, of course, do your best to stay dry. Don't eat snow for hydration unless you absolutely have to. Lavoie also says your body uses a great deal of energy to convert matter from one state to another. That's why he says you should eat snow as a substitute for water only as a last resort. In gaining that small amount of hydration, you'll give up precious body heat. If your plane makes a water landing, resist the urge to inflate your life jacket immediately. Alvin Yip warns against the impulse to inflate your life jacket immediately if a plane is making an emergency landing on water. The buoyancy of the jacket could make it harder for you to run inside the cabin if water rushes in, Yip says. So swim to an exit, then inflate your jacket to stay afloat. If you're lost, walking downhill raises your chances of finding help. People often build societies around nearby water sources, and since water flows downhill, you'll increase your chances of finding help if you're able to walk downhill, Ernest Adams says. Adams uses the example of Juliane Koepcke, a plane crash survivor who floated down a river for nine days in 1971 before finding shelter. Several hours later, she was rescued. You can perform the Heimlich maneuvre on yourself. Few people realise that they don't need someone else to dislodge a piece of food from their throat. Naman Mitruka explains how to perform the Heimlich on yourself: 1. \"Form a fist with your stronger hand below your rib cage and just above the navel. Place your other palm over the fist to push more firmly.\" 2. \"Drive your fist in and up in the diaphragm area (the top of your stomach) forcefully and repeat several times till the object stuck in your throat is dislodged.\" Keep maximum-strength antihistamines in your wallet or bag when you go somewhere new. You never know when you'll encounter something that you didn't know you're allergic to, especially when camping or hiking, according to Ryan Borek. The limits of the human body tend to follow a \"rule of three.\" Survivalists have a shorthand for knowing their limits, Ruchin Agarwal says. People can generally go three minutes without air, three hours without shelter in extreme weather environments, three days without water, and three weeks without food, Agarwal says. If cooking oil catches fire, turn off the burner and cover the pot. Agarwal also says people should never use water to put out grease fires. The water molecules sink to the bottom of the hot pan, evaporate instantly, and shoot the flames even higher. Instead, you can put an oil fire out by cutting the heat and taking away the oxygen. If you get stabbed or impaled by a sharp object, leave it be. Pulling out an object that has been lodged in your body will increase the rate of blood loss, Thomas Mei says. Instead, try to cover the wound and do anything you can to stop the bleeding until you find a medical professional. Most airplane crashes happen within three minutes after takeoff or eight minutes before landing. According to Sanket Shah, the +3/-8 rule encourages people to be vigilant immediately after takeoff and right before landing because about 80% of crashes happen during those windows. You can use that time to stay alert and locate exits rather than getting lost in a podcast or movie. Most deaths in house fires are caused by smoke inhalation, not burns. Stay low to the ground to avoid breathing in too much smoke, says Harsh Sharma. If you get hurt in a public place, single out one person for help to avoid the bystander effect. Sharma also explains the well-studied psychological phenomenon that says crowds of people fail to help somebody because everyone thinks someone else will intervene. If you're not too hurt to call out for help, pick one person and direct your pleas to them. You'll be more likely to get the aid you need. A bright flashlight could be a good weapon against an attacker. An extremely bright flashlight could ward off a mugger just as effectively as mace or a weapon, Shah says. \"If you have someone approaching you that seems aggressive, in the gravest extreme, a blast of 300+ lumen to the eyes (especially at night) will give you the opportunity to get out,\" he quotes in his answer. \"And suppose you misread the situation \u2014 no one is really harmed, and you can't get in trouble for it.\" If you get lost on a hike, try to find a fence or stream. \"The stream always flows downhill and invariably will reach a larger tributary or a body of water,\" says Jon Mixon. And \"the fence will almost always lead to a road or a structure.\" Use condoms as makeshift water storage. Condoms are incredibly elastic. As Janis Butevics says, you can use that to your advantage if you need a quick way to store a large volume of water. They essentially act like bladders and are capable of holding a gallon of water,\" Butevics says. \"They can also be used to protect against water, as a stretchable cover for valuable items like matches and walkie-talkies,\" Butevics wrote. Picking out exits ahead of time will cut through your \"normalcy bias.\" When warnings are sent about natural disasters, many people stay put even when told to evacuate. As John Ewing says, psychologists call the phenomenon the \"normalcy bias.\" It refers to people's tendency to think everything will turn out OK even when they're clearly in danger. Ewing says people can counteract the normalcy bias by locating multiple exits when they're in public places, such as at the movies or out to eat. Mentally preparing yourself to act if a dangerous situation arises will train you to be vigilant, Ewing says.", "When the water levels were lowered in an eastern China reservoir due to a renovation project, no one was expecting to find a 600-year-old Buddha statue.

Those looking to find a new job  and maybe contemplating uprooting themselves to do it  should do some research on which cities offer the best opportunities for work. To get a sense of which large cities give job seekers the best chance of finding employment, we looked to data from Indeed.com, a large job search platform that operates throughout the U.S. and internationally. The company provided us numbers on which cities in the U.S. have the most job openings per capita. We folded Indeed's numbers into an easy-to-read slideshow of the top 10 easiest cities for finding a job, which you will find below. Indeed.com pulls this jobs-per-capita data at various points throughout the year so we looked at which cities made jumps over last quarter, as the most recent data we are using for our list emerged in October. Richmond, Virginia, comes in sixth place in this latest data set, having jumped up from ninth place last quarter. Nashville, which placed eighth by the latest numbers, had previously placed sixth, showing a small drop. The top three cities with the most open jobs per capita are static from last quarter. In third place we see Denver, Colorado, which shows 57 job openings per 1,000 residents in that metropolitan region. In second place we see Salt lake City, Utah, with 65 jobs per 1,000 people living there, and in first place is San Jose, California  in the heart of Silicon Valley  with 67 jobs. Good news for those cities, but the other side of the spectrum tells a story of slightly tighter job markets. Indeed.com researched the 50 most populous metropolitan regions in the country, and the bottom ten  cities with the lowest number of job openings per 1,000 residents  was also made available for our coverage.

How many politicians have done that before, eh? News sourced from TOI", "The NFL split a massive $7.24 billion in revenue with all 32 teams last season. Each team received $226.4 million as part of the split, most of which comes from the various television deals. The numbers come from the Green Bay Packers' annual financial report, via the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. If you're having trouble grasping the meaning of that massive amount of money, the NFL would qualify as one of the richest countries on the world, at least according to Wikipedia. Their numbers would put them somewhere in the 145 range. The league would rank somewhere around No. 50 overall when it comes to private companies as well, according to this list from Forbes. More comparisons to help put $7.24 billion in context: Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers makes an average annual salary of $22 million -- to put this into perspective, the Packers made just over 10 times that amount in national revenue alone. As the only NFL team publicly owned by fans, the Packers are required to release this financial information on a yearly basis. The numbers are up significantly from last year, in which roughly $6 billion was split between the teams. That's a pretty significant increase, which isn't surprising given the fact that new TV deals kicked in this past season. Those TV deals include new basic deals with CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC, ESPN and the NFL Network, including the Thursday Night Football package for CBS. That deal was worth $275 million, and has been renewed for 2015 at $300 million. It's possible these numbers will be even more massive next year, as DirecTV and the NFL agreed on a new deal for NFL Sunday Ticket, which kicks in this season. The national revenue sharing is up by a massive 120 percent over the last 11 years, according to Darren Rovell of ESPN. That also factors in inflation. To compare, for the 2012 season, teams received a $179.9 million slice of the pie. National revenue growth per team from 2005-10 was 16.2 percent, while from 2010-14 it grew a massive 136 percent. Needless to say, the TV deals are being awfully kind to the NFL these days. For the Packers themselves, they also reported a record of $375.7 million in revenue in 2014, up more than $50 million from the previous year.", "An abashed Wes Welker said this week that he dressed up as Britney Spears -- complete with blond wig and tiny sports bra -- to entertain his peers when he was a teen. In an interview with Dan Hellie, host of \"NFL Total Access,\" the 32-year-old NFL star admitted that he masqueraded as the pop star during a pep rally at his Oklahoma high school while he was a student there. \"Gosh, I\u2019d love to say false there, but I did... they have me on video,\" the Denver Broncos wide receiver told Hellie in response to questions about the high school dance routine, adding: \"But I've already bought them off, so you won't be seeing that anything soon.\" It looks like Welker may have been cheated out of his money, however, as a video of him dressed up and shaking his booty like Spears was actually leaked online by News9.com last year: According to the news outlet, Welker danced to the pop princess' hit song \"(You drive me) crazy\" in 1999 during his senior year at Heritage Hall High School in Oklahoma City. Welker was reportedly a football star at his school -- and quite the prankster. \"He was a superstar in the homecoming pep assembly lip sync contest in his senior year,\" the footballer's former teacher Betsy Horn told News9.com. \"He was a backup dancer.

Benning / GFZ Your first thought on seeing this weird pink snow might be an industrial accident or a nearby Big Foot massacre. Rest assured, it\u2019s neither\u2014just a perfectly natural, snow-dwelling algae. So, why are scientists all in a tizzy about it? Because it\u2019s causing glaciers to melt faster. That\u2019s the startling conclusion of a study just published in Nature Communications that which suggests we may have seriously underestimated the ability of tiny red algae to screw with Earth\u2019s ice caps. And their so-called \"bio-albedo\" feedback is only expected to grow as the planet warms up. Red snow algae have been described all over the world in polar and alpine settings from Greenland and Antarctica to Iceland and the European Alps. In the winter, they lie dormant in the snow as spores. But in the late spring and summer, when their icy habitat begins to melt, they blossom to produce striking pink landscapes. Now, a sweeping analysis of red snow algae across 21 glaciers in the pan-European Arctic shows that these tiny critters are actually helping the snow melt faster. An up-close shot of a colony of red snow algae. Image: Stefanie Lutz/GFZ The reason has to do with a simple climate-altering process known as the albedo effect. You\u2019ve probably heard about how glaciers keep our planet cool by reflecting sunlight. As glaciers melt, they give way to darker land or ocean surfaces\u2014surfaces with a lower albedo. This causes the Earth to absorb more sunlight and heat up even more. Turns out, red snow algae have a non-trivial effect on the albedo of the snowy surfaces they colonize, reducing it by as much as 13 percent, according to the new study. And while it\u2019s still unclear just how large these blooms can get, lead study author Steffi Lutz of the University of Leeds says they can be quite widespread in the Arctic by summertime. Sponsored \"Based on personal observations, a conservative estimate would be 50 percent of the snow surface on a glacier at the end of a melt season,\" she told Gizmodo in an email. \"But this can potentially be even higher.\" This makes red snow algae an unaccounted mechanism in the long list of reasons the Arctic is melting like a popsicle in a microwave. Lutz and her colleagues are now working to estimate how much glacial melt red snow algae are actually responsible for. They\u2019re also hoping to incorporate the colorful critters into future global climate models. What\u2019s worrisome is that even if red snow algae have a small influence on Arctic ice cover today, their role is likely to grow as human carbon emissions warm the planet. \"The algae need liquid water in order to bloom,\" Lutz said. \"Therefore the melting of snow and ice surfaces controls the abundance of the algae. The more melting, the more algae. With temperatures rising globally, the snow algae phenomenon will likely also increase leading to an even higher bio-albedo effect.\" It\u2019s yet another reminder that microbes are pulling the strings around here much more than we humans tend to appreciate. And that even as Miami drowns, some creatures will thrive in the hotter future. [Nature Communications]", "A field guide to the five tribes of modern male fashion.

Lacking the Italian tradition of spiffy sartorial informality, American blokes plunged into crisis, to mention nothing of plunging into a lot of seriously tragic clothing: baggy Dockers with belt pagers, excruciatingly naff golf shirts and top-siders and white tube socks. Confusion reigned. It seemed like the perfect moment to take the pulse of our male customers and find out what was, and was not, informing their fashion choices. Our research revealed something rather shocking: The main preoccupation for men when shopping for casual clothing, or suits and coats, was not glamour, fashion, or style. The overriding concern of all our sampled dudes was a fear of \"getting it wrong.\" Those male shoppers of yore, the poor darlings, lived with a veritable sword of Damocles hanging over their combovers. They believed in the existence of a mysterious set of edicts that governed the dressing of the male body. Failure to obey would result in certain death. The notion of \"getting it wrong\" came up so often in our research that we started incorporating the phrase \"get it right\" into our advertising. We even took out copyright protection on this comforting command. Time marched on. By the turn of the century, the alta kakas in the naff golf shirts had retired or kicked the bucket. The aughts saw the arrival of the metrosexual revolution and a vanquishing of that strange preoccupation with getting it wrong. There followed an explosion of self-expression, style, fashion, VIP bottle service, male vanity, and peacocking. Dressing impressively, creatively, or interestingly no longer suggested perversion, inversion, or execution by firing squad. It was the right of every man. Prada and Tom Ford stitched up Hollywood actors. David Beckham wore a sarong. Trey Parker wore a plunging printed chiffon gown to the Oscars. Teeth were whitened. Man jewelry jangled. Man bags dangled. Freedom reigned. Freak flags flew. Then, just as a whole new generation of lads was starting to let down their guard, along came the sulfurous, satanic peanut gallery of social media. The hypercritical thumbs-up/thumbs-down ethos of the internet brought back the notion of getting it wrong and sent all but the bravest of dudes scurrying off into the undergrowth. Here the terrified men found like-minded souls and splintered into groups. Tribes were formed. Back in my early Barneys days, getting it right was more a matter of details: side vent or center vent? Two buttons or three? Cuffs or no cuffs? Brown shoes or black? But getting it right, in its current incarnation, has become all about tribe membership. In today\u2019s fashion landscape, tribes are the name of the game. Joining a tribe\u2014a tribe that resonates with your tastes and worldview\u2014and embracing its rules is now the only way to experience that feel-good got-it-right sensation. Peeved at the thought of having to conform to group expectations and tribal lore? Petrified that your identity is going to be squashed? Worried that you will never be able to figure out which tribe to join? Relax and grow a pair. It\u2019s not that big a deal. There are, at this particular point in time, only five tribes from which to pick: the Perverse Prepster, the Arty Ninja, the Dedicated Follower of Satin, the Statham, and the Schlub. I guarantee that you, the ordinary man in the street, will fit comfortably into one of these categories. But how will you know? Over the course of this series, when you encounter the tribe that best resonates with your essence, you will experience a frisson in your follicles and a distinct tingle in your chakras. Ready. Set. Prepare to tingle.", "Are you considering a career transition? Keep in mind the modern job search can take time, and as we all know: time is money. While the good news is that the IRS considers some job search expenses tax deductible, the bad news is that those expenses can be hard to prepare for in periods of employment uncertainty. I sat down with five of my favorite finance experts to gather their advice on how to make the most of your money during a career pivot. 1. Pad Your Savings A career change is a major life transition and shouldn't be taken lightly. We typically spend more during life transitions and a career change is no different. Prepare for your overhead and fixed costs but also think about any one-time special expenses you may incur. Is the corporate culture and dress code different where you are going? Are you expected to cover more or less costs up-front for work-related expenses? Make sure you're saving for these transition costs well in advance of your resignation date. 2. Know How Long You Can Float Have a good understanding of your monthly expenses (what comes in and what goes out) and beef up your emergencies and opportunities fund in the months prior to your departure. This will help you know where you have room to cut back and make adjustments, and have the confidence of knowing exactly how long a period of time your savings can carry you with less or no income. 3. Budget For Your Future Create a future budget. Use sites like Glassdoor.com to help estimate your next job or your new business's earning potential, but also don't forget to adjust for additional expenses your new position will entail as well. Are you moving for this new job? How much will your relocation cost you? Once you're settled in your new place, consider changes in rent and utilities that might come with your new environment. How about your commute costs: will you be paying new tolls or have to take a new train into work? Create a monthly budget to be sure you've factored in all you can predict about your new fixed expenses and new income. 4. Maximize Your Earnings Remember that your salary isn't the only piece of your compensation that you can negotiate. Think about how much you want to be paid, and then decide what else matters most to you. Is it vital to you to have several weeks of vacation every year? The option to work remotely once in awhile? Maybe you can get your metro fare paid for. Be sure to ask about a retirement match. You'll be able to save so much more if your employer contributes as well. All of these benefits matter just as much as your paycheck. 5. Consider How Much Your Career Change Is Worth When making a career change, you may have to take a step back financially to take a step forward into a new career. While reviewing if your career pivot is viable, don't let your financial situation completely stop you from pursuing your goal. Keep your eye on the prize and be willing to be flexible and even sacrifice if you want to make your dreams a reality. At the end of the day, money might not be the most important factor for you when maximizing other components of your work/life satisfaction.", "Coworkers helped Chris Veseth, who was born with cerebral palsy, raise funds for a new wheelchair through gofundme.com.", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A sobering portrait of less-educated middle-age white Americans emerged Thursday with new research showing them dying disproportionately from what one expert calls \"deaths of despair\"\u2014suicides, drug overdoses and alcohol-related diseases. The new paper by two Princeton University economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, concludes that the trend is driven by the loss of steady middle-income jobs for those with a high school diploma or less. The economists also argue that dwindling job opportunities have triggered broader problems for this group. They are more likely than their college-educated counterparts, for example, to be unemployed, unmarried or suffering from poor health. \"This is a story of the collapse of the white working class,\" Deaton said in an interview. \"The labor market has very much turned against them.\" Those dynamics helped fuel the rise of President Donald Trump, who won widespread support among whites with only a high school diploma. Yet Deaton said his policies are unlikely to reverse these trends, particularly the health care legislation now before the House that Trump is championing. That bill would lead to higher premiums for older Americans, the Congressional Budget Office has found. \"The policies that you see, seem almost perfectly designed to hurt the very people who voted for him,\" Deaton said. Case and Deaton\u2019s paper, issued by the Brookings Institution, follows up on research they released in 2015 that first documented a sharp increase in mortality among middle-aged whites. Since 1999, white men and women ages 45 through 54 have endured a sharp increase in \"deaths of despair,\" Case and Deaton found in their earlier work. These include suicides, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related deaths such as liver failure. In the paper released Thursday, Case and Deaton draw a clearer relationship between rising death rates and changes in the job market since the 1970s. They find that men without college degrees are less likely to receive rising incomes over time, a trend \"consistent with men moving to lower and lower skilled jobs.\" Other research has found that Americans with only high school diplomas are less likely to get married or purchase a home and more likely to get divorced if they do marry. \"It\u2019s not just their careers that have gone down the tubes, but their marriage prospects, their ability to raise children,\" said Deaton, who won the Nobel prize in economics in 2015 for his long-standing work on solutions to poverty. \"That\u2019s the kind of thing that can lead people to despair.\" The issues identified by Case and Deaton are likely contributing to a slight reversal in a decades-long trend of improving life-expectancy data. It\u2019s not entirely clear why these trends have affected whites much more than they have African-Americans or Hispanics, whose death rates are improving. Case and Deaton note that many Hispanics are \"markedly better off\" than parents or grandparents who were born abroad, enabling a greater sense of optimism. African-Americans, they add, may have become more resilient to economic challenges given their long-standing disadvantages in the job market. Other researchers have said that whites may have an easier time obtaining painkillers that are behind an epidemic of drug overdoses. The data is clear, though: In 1999, the death rate for high school-educated whites ages 50 through 54 was 30 percent lower than the death rate for all African-Americans in that age group. By 2015, it was 30 percent higher. The educational split is also growing. Even while the death rate for whites without a college degree is rising, the rate for whites who are college graduates is falling, Case and Deaton found. The trends cut across diverse regions of the country, the researchers found. While the worst-hit spots include Appalachian states such as West Virginia and Kentucky, they also include such areas as Maine, Baltimore and eastern Washington state. The patterns are evident in rural sections and smaller cities as well as in some large metro areas, the research found. Americans with less education are also faring much worse when compared with adults in other countries, Case and Deaton concluded. Death rates in Europe for people with limited education are falling \u2014 and in most countries, they\u2019re falling faster than death rates for those with more education. For those reasons, Case and Deaton discount the notion that government disability benefit programs are responsible for some of these problems by enabling more Americans to stop working. Social welfare programs in Europe are typically more generous yet haven\u2019t caused a rise in death rates. Given the long-running nature of these trends, many of which stem from the 1970s, reversing them could take years, Case and Deaton write. But there are immediate steps that could be taken, Deaton said in the interview. Routine prescriptions for opioids should be cut back. And, \"Europe has a much better safety net than we do, and they\u2019re not seeing the same sort of problems as we are,\" he said.", "Attention, world: Leighton Meester is a feminist, and she's not afraid to say it. The \"Gossip Girl\" star spoke to OOTD magazine about her recent collaboration with Nelly.com as well as the people who have influenced her and lessons she's learned during her career. When asked who her role model was, Meester responded: The American writer Betty Friedan -- she fought for gender equality and wrote the great book The Feminine Mystique which sparked the beginning of a second-wave feminism. She went on to agree that she identifies as a feminist, stating: \"I believe in equal rights for men and women.\" Given the shocking number of female celebrities who refuse to identify as feminists, we're excited to see Meester join the ranks of those who aren't afraid of the \"F-word.\" And her advice to young girls who want to succeed is refreshingly practical: \"Read and fight for an education.\" This is the best thing we've heard Meester say since she announced that \"Hillary Clinton is one of my role models -- I do not break treaties, you ass,\" as Blair Waldorf.

Today marks the first day of a pie- and beer-only diet. The idea of the experiment is to prove there's no special trick to dieting and all that matters is putting in less energy to your body than you use during the day and you will lose weight. For breakfast, lunch and dinner I'll be eating pies only and, on a Friday, I can exchange one pie for three beers, which has a similar amount of calories. Women need less calories than men, who need 2500 calories a day. The pie and beer diet is only 1600 calories a day - two-thirds of what a man needs, which means there will be weight loss.", "When Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president a year ago, Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight political blog said he had \"a better chance of cameoing in another \u2018Home Alone\u2019 movie with Macaulay Culkin\u2014or playing in the NBA Finals\u2014than winning the Republican nomination.\" With a net favorability rating of -32 percent according to FiveThirtyEight and \"exactly zero\" chance of winning, according to The Atlantic, how has Trump seemingly emerged victorious from a pool of 17 Republican hopefuls? To try to answer that question would be to travel down a rabbit hole of speculation that has swallowed so many. One thing is sure, though: While Donald Trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits. The reality is that Trump\u2014like policymakers and politicians past, present and future\u2014is operating within the confines of the Overton Window of Political Possibility. The Overton Window: When You Think About It, It\u2019s So True... This theory, named for the late Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. The Overton Window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. Although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window. For example, consider federal welfare policy. Even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the United States, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, Medicaid, etc. These are within the Overton Window. Other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window. Trump\u2019s Public Policy, Explained With this in mind, now consider Trump\u2019s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent Orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the Pulse nightclub. About a week after making the statement, Trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons. This wasn\u2019t just a flip-flop or mere pandering \u2014 it\u2019s more likely that Trump\u2019s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the Overton Window. While many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the Second Amendment, even the NRA\u2014which endorsed him\u2014said, \"No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms.\" Using the Overton Window Theory to Your Advantage It is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents. When Trump said Orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters. The lesson in all this is that politicians, as Friedrich Hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea. They only go where the current leads them, and it is us \u2014 you, me and our neighbors \u2014 who determine the direction of the current. In other words, if you want to see policy change\u2014if you want to expand the Overton Window\u2014appeal to the hearts and minds of your fellow citizens and the politicians will soon follow.", "The President looks like everyone's dad. Unless your dad dresses well Donald Trump makes no secret of his wealth, so you\u2019d think he might be able to find a suit that fits. His trousers are too baggy, his jackets are boxy, his ties are too wide and often too long, and his lapels are too big. Trump is not the only politician guilty of wearing ill-fitting suits - across the world, the political elite dress terribly. But why? Is it deliberate, or do politicians just have bad taste? With their sartorial advisors and ample funds, surely they could make the effort to see a tailor? Well the reason is actually three-fold: Firstly, politicians all want to appear relatable - they avoid looking too slick or flashy so as not to alienate working class voters who can\u2019t afford a \u00a35,000 suit. During last year\u2019s election campaign, Hillary Clinton was blasted for wearing a $12,000 (\u00a39,600) Armani jacket and Theresa May sparked outrage for wearing a pair of \u00a3995 leather trousers. Barry Brummett, a professor of communication at the University of Texas, told Mel Magazine that you \"have to show that people from all classes ... can identify with you\". \"You can\u2019t go on wearing overalls, but you also can\u2019t be too flashy.\" Secondly, the demands of holding office mean politicians\u2019 weights often fluctuate - it\u2019s a stressful job, and just like the rest of us, stress can result in periods of binge eating followed by not eating. If your weight\u2019s changing all the time, there\u2019s no way you could be constantly in a perfectly-fitting suit, according to Washington DC-based political consultant Josh Nanberg. And the third reason is that because politicians spend their days going from meetings to lunches to events, their suits get rumpled quickly.  Most of us working in professions that require suits probably spend the majority of the day sitting at a desk with our jacket nicely hung-up, but not politicians. And of course, their outfits are scrutinised wherever they go (particularly if they happen to be female). So it\u2019s probably only partially deliberate that Trump\u2019s suits are horrendous - he could undoubtedly get himself some better clothes without spending the average citizen\u2019s annual income. Barack Obama, for example, always wore suits that fit him well, despite his admission that he didn\u2019t want to make decisions about what he wore \"because I have too many other decisions to make.\" Of course, whilst appearing relatable, a head of state also needs to seem professional, so it\u2019s a tricky balance to strike. \"You want the voter to be concentrated not on what you\u2019re wearing, but what you\u2019re trying to communicate,\" Jason Levin from LA-based communications company Cerrell Associates told Mel Magazine. Trump may be unlikely to change his policies any time soon, but he could at least upgrade his wardrobe.", "An autopsy report released by the Orange County Medical Examiner's Office on Friday reveals that YouTube and The Voice star Christina Grimmie's official cause of death was two gunshot wounds to her head and chest.

There are exactly zero Black Friday deals worth getting enough to hurt someone, or risk being hurt yourself. This is what Tickle-Me-Elmo thinks of the fact that your deranged, barbaric consumerism allowed your mind to go there even for a second: (via YouTube) While we're with Elmo on this one -- and you really should be too -- hordes of people around the nation must be at least a little less sure. They're preparing to camp out in frigid temperatures outside big box stores, waiting to join the crush of humanity as it flows through the aisles, carrying away the best deals on products that they never really needed in the first place. Black Friday can seem ridiculous, but it's no joke. Every year, seemingly unfathomable things happen on the day after Thanksgiving, including deaths and injuries. The first casualty of modern times came in 2008, when a New York Walmart worker was killed in a stampede of frenzied shoppers. Five years later, Walmart still hasn't paid a fine for its employee's death. In 2011, Black Friday shoppers ignored a collapsed comrade, leaving him to die as they rushed the store hunting for sales. A year later, would-be customers exchanged gunfire outside a store after a dispute over a parking spot. Two were wounded. If you think that's bad, it's only getting worse. This year, the deals are starting earlier than ever, with many stores opening their doors to the masses on Thanksgiving Day, thereby forcing workers and enabling shopping obsessed consumers to give up their holiday. Look, we understand the desire to get Christmas shopping out of the way as early and as cheaply as possible. But if you're considering taking part in Black Friday (or Thursday) this year, just ask yourself: Is the urge to buy things really so strong that you need to partake in a free-for-all that will undoubtedly end in tragedy for someone, somewhere this year?", "Before you go, we thought you'd like these...

That strain of criticism became all the more pronounced in the buildup to the AMC drama's series finale, with Vulture launching the latest broadside against the show's popularity as author Michael Idov argued that it wasn't truly popular, just overhyped. (To support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in Russia.) To some degree, this is true. Back when the series debuted, the media wrote about Mad Men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. The first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times \u2014 a much more perilous event in an age when DVRs and streaming services were less prevalent. But by season two, the awards and critical attention Mad Men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run. Still, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in Idov's words, shoving Mad Men down readers' throats. Here are five. 1) Readers wanted to read about it In my pre-Vox life, I was the TV editor of The A.V. Club, a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of TV content readers wanted to consume. And every time we wrote about Mad Men, those numbers spiked. The show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership, and a well-timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle This has carried right over to Vox. We write a lot about the show because there's a huge audience out there ready to devour Mad Men content \u2014 far beyond any other show I've written about here that's not Game of Thrones. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle. Yes, the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the show's finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show. But it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material. Some of that was an accident of timing. 2) Mad Men debuted right after The Sopranos ended and filled the void the show left When Mad Men began, in the summer of 2007, The Sopranos had ended just a few weeks before. The Wire (never as popular in terms of raw readership numbers, though no slouch itself) would end in early 2008. Lost was the king of the recap roost at the time, but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand, unified theories of why the show worked, rather than the sorts of symbolic interpretations The Sopranos invited. Mad Men also benefitted from the rise of TV recapping in general Thus, there was a huge opening in the \"reading about TV on the internet\" marketplace that was beginning to boom in the late 2000s, and Mad Men filled it as surely as it filled the slots vacated by Sopranos at the Golden Globes and the Emmys. The two shows' thematic concerns, use of dreamlike imagery, and storytelling structure were incredibly similar, which only helped matters. But Mad Men also benefited from the rise of TV recapping in general. Alan Sepinwall began his seminal blog What's Alan Watching in late 2005, and by that final Sopranos season, dozens of publications were dipping their toes into the recap waters. That number would explode in years to come \u2014 and Mad Men was a natural fit for publications that wanted to write TV recaps and people who wanted to read them. 3) There just wasn't as much good TV on When Mad Men started, it was popular to suggest that the end of The Sopranos, the cancellation of HBO's Deadwood, and the impending end of The Wire signaled the end of TV's Golden Age. (Sound familiar?) Instead, Mad Men and later Breaking Bad picked up that ball and ran with it, while FX entered the early stages of a hot streak that continues to this day. But, really, in that summer of 2007, the established shows worth writing about were few and far between \u2014 especially if you didn't want to publish weekly, in-depth reviews of comedies (a later development, largely driven by content-hungry sites like, well, The A.V. Club). They were essentially limited to The Wire, Dexter, Lost, Heroes, 24, Grey's Anatomy, and maybe Veronica Mars (if your readership was especially young). Thus, it was easy to get the \"serious TV\" audience to tune in to Mad Men, because there weren't a ton of other options. Mad Men suggested every cable channel should have its own scripted drama series in development \u2014 and now they pretty much all do Contrast that to today, when a show like The Americans can't get the same sort of readership traction as Mad Men (even though it has a loyal, dedicated audience that likes reading about it), simply because there's so much more stuff out there. This most recent season of that FX drama received the kind of acclaim Mad Men did in its heyday \u2014 but it's much, much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other shows out there. Mad Men suggested every single cable channel should have its own scripted drama in development \u2014 and now they pretty much all do. 4) Mad Men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done Though it never pulled in Big Bang Theory numbers, AMC told Vulture's Joe Adalian that at the show's height, a total of just under 7 million people watched it. That number's not insignificant, and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading pieces about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most websites \u2014 especially back in 2007, when the overall online readership was smaller. 5) Never underestimate passion As my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote about the popularity of Bernie Sanders' presidential candidacy online, a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves readers. What holds true for Sanders is also true for Mad Men: there are very few casual Mad Men fans. And those passionate fans tend to seek out everything they can find about the show. Early on, the media positioned Mad Men as a sort of lifestyle choice The media is, of course, at least somewhat complicit in this. Early on, we positioned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice \u2014 if you were cool, you would watch Mad Men. But TV sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years, and few of them held up, readership-wise, as well as Mad Men did. (Whither Boardwalk Empire?) Yes, the early push might have been a bit much, but Mad Men ended up having the goods \u2014 at least for the people who cared about it. I agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of Mad Men. Those of us who write about television do too often ignore the shows that a majority of Americans are actually watching, shows like The Big Bang Theory and NCIS and even Empire. But the kinds of people who read our websites are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of Mad Men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even several episodes of NCIS. (Believe me. I've tried.) The answer to why the media keeps pushing Mad Men on the people is simple: the people keep pushing it on us.", "Prepare yourself to view one of your kitchen utensils in a whole new light after reading this.

The thing is, we've discovered something wonderful about the spoon, and it's pretty close to life-changing. That is not an exaggeration, either. Take a look at this picture of a nice spaghetti spoon, posted by Imgur user PolarChi on to the picture-sharing site. Looks like any, ordinary spaghetti spoon, doesn't it? But wait: there's nothing ordinary about this. See the big hole in the spoon? There's a reason for that. And a bloody good one at that. Did you know that you're supposed to use that very hole to determine how much spaghetti to cook per portion? Most Popular It's always been one of life's mysteries, the exact amount of spaghetti to cook. You either cook enough for a remake of the feeding of the five thousand, or you give yourself a feeble amount that wouldn't be enough to fill the stomach of a six-year-old child. But place the dried spaghetti in the hole, et voila: there's your measurements. Now be on your way, happy and free in the knowledge that there's often more to things in life than we first notice.

We've seen some twists and turns so far -- Tove Lo losing in the first round, Hey Violet making an incredible run to the Final Four, arguable pre-tourney favorite Carly Rae Jepsen unexpectedly going down in the Elite Eight -- as our editorial team has voted for a winner in each of the head-to-head battles. But for the finals, we left the decision in your hands, allowing you guys to vote for the overall victor in our tournament's finals: Charli XCX vs. Vince Staples. And after three days of voting, your decision has been made clear. The winner of Billboard's first-ever Should-Be-Bigger Bracket is... ...Charli XCX. Yes, after fighting her way through Shura, Lizzo, Sky Ferreira and Tinashe, Charli triumphed over West Coast rapper Vince Staples to take home the ultimate trophy. The game wasn't a particularly close one -- Charli commanded over 80% of the total overall voteA\u0302 -- so let's hope the NCAA final between Gonzaga and North Carolina on Monday night (Apr. 3) packs a little more suspense.

Paul plays Hollis, a widower alcoholic who loves his two young sons, but doesn't have the wherewithal or time to monitor their every move. That leads his oldest son, Jacob (Josh Wiggins), into many run-ins with the law -- which threatens to tear what's left of this family apart. When you meet Aaron Paul in person, he's pretty much exactly what you'd hope him to be: very enthusiastic and very blunt, but still in a charming, boyish way. We met off Park City's Main Street to discuss life after Jesse Pinkman -- Paul has a plethora of upcoming projects -- and his now-famous appearance on \"The Price is Right.\" I was just looking at your IMDb page and realized you were on both \"Beverly Hills 90210\" and \"Melrose Place,\" and you played different characters. Yeah, you know, that was when my career, I thought, was taking off. And then I didn't work for like six months. But, yeah, the original \"90210.\" It's a classic. It is a classic. Luke Perry directed my episode! I didn't realize that. Yeah. \"Hellion\" is not false advertising. Jacob is a hellion. Yes! He is absolutely a hellion. Quite the opposite as just a day-to-day person -- Josh is incredible. Hollis has had a tough time. It probably doesn't help that he wears that Astros hat and that's such a sad team to root for right now. I know ... It just adds to his woes. [Laughs] But, you know, he's a diehard fan. He believes in them. You don't jump off the bandwagon. You've got to believe in your team, man! Through the highs and lows! It was nice watching you play someone who is so different than Jesse Pinkman. Was that important to you? Absolutely. For me, it's always about doing something that I've never done before. And that's just exciting to me. You know, mix it up. I've always considered myself a character actor. Still? Yeah, I think so. I would hope so. You just played one of the most popular characters in television history. But that was a character, though! So you could say that about any actor. Right. Absolutely. But there are actors who play the same role in every single thing. Do you know what I mean? Okay, I see what you're saying. They play the same tone in everything. I don't talk like Jesse Pinkman. You tweet like him. During the show, yeah. I absolutely embodied Jesse Pinkman. You know, I'm just giving what the fans want, man! But yeah, they like it. They love it whenever I say \"bitch.\" You said it during a Golden Globes speech. Yeah. Did you know that was coming? Vince Gilligan said, \"Listen, I really don't see this happening, but, if it does end up going our way, I'll say something and I'll just send it to you and have you just end it.\" So, I had a feeling -- I knew what he was asking me to do. It seemed like a crowd-pleaser. \"Yeah, bitch!\" So, yeah, that's that. Hollis seems like an older guy that we're used to seeing you play. Was that intentional? He's just lived a different life. And Jesse definitely went through his struggles, but Hollis is going through his own set of struggles ... he's different. He's not Jesse Pinkman. Post-\"Breaking Bad,\" are you happy with the roles you're being offered? A nice swath of different things? Yeah, it's great. But with a character as popular as Jesse, there's always a danger people would want you to keep doing that. That's why I just say no -- and I do things like \"Hellion.\" Have you gotten offers that are too similar? Yeah. A lot of people want me to play -- I mean, great scripts! -- but people that are dealing with drug problems or that sort of thing. It's just kind of like the obvious choice. But, I'm just, for right now -- I'm not saying I'm never going to go down that path 10, 15, 30 years from now -- but I'm saying right now, for me, it would just be idiotic for me to jump onto another Jesse Pinkman-esque type role. And so that's why I try and do something different like \"Hellion\" or like \"Exodus\"... Directed by Ridley Scott... Ridley Scott, yeah. And it's biblical, so that's a little different than Jesse as well. I assume \"Need For Speed\" is not biblical. \"Need For Speed\" is not biblical, no. But \"Need for Speed\" is not Jesse Pinkman, either. What should we expect from that character? Well, Tobey Marshall is a guy who runs an auto body shop. He is obsessed with racing -- he lives and breaths it. It's in his blood. His father started this auto body shop -- and his father dies and now he's left with trying to keep his business afloat. He's got his shit together -- not a drug addict. He doesn't do meth; he doesn't kill people. Different. When you were on \"The Price is Right,\" did you have any idea you were going to be called down to contestants' row? No. So it's a complete surprise? Yeah, yeah. But it's not like they're pulling a name out of a hat at random. They want someone who is going to be excited. Yeah, they bring in 10 people at a time and you kind of do an interview process. And that's that. They want people that are excited. And I went there -- you saw -- in a crazy outfit... We've all seen now. I was wearing a crazy outfit and I drank a bunch of Red Bull. I had the most energy of any human being! And they called my name and I think the combination of them calling my name and the combination of the six cans of Red Bull -- I was just teetering on the line of having a heart attack. But, yeah, it was great. Were you surprised when that video became an Internet sensation? No, I was not surprised it became an Internet sensation. That video is crazy. I was surprised that it took that long to surface. Jay Leno -- [sarcastically] bless him -- he's the one that made that happen.

The size of the new center was not revealed, but many of Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers can reach the high hundreds of thousands in square feet, or the size of many football fields. Amazon uses its fulfillment centers as warehouses for its own inventory as well as for third-party merchants who want sell to Amazon's estimated 50 million Prime members. Prime members pay $99 annually to get anything from toilet paper to diapers to books delivered to them in two days or less. Amazon said that this second facility in Joliet would be used to pack and ship smaller shipments. Increasingly, these orders are being delivered in a matter of hours through Amazon's Prime Now service, one part of the company's aggressive strategy for getting goods to customer's doorsteps as fast as possible. Currently, the only midwestern city where Prime Now is available is in Chicago. The Joliet facility could be a central place for deliveries to Chicago as it is only 40 miles away from the Windy City. Amazon continues to expand the number of fulfillment centers in the U.S. as its fulfillment business for third-party sellers continues to grow. Outside sellers now account for more than 45% of total number of items sold on Amazon, a 5% uptick since January.

No, he did not become a model. He became the world's first professional Kim Jong Un impersonator. Howard has been told he resembles the infamous dictator since 2011, when Kim took power. In full makeup, hair and suit, the two are almost indistinguishable. According to Barcroft TV, it was only when a picture of Howard went viral on Facebook last April that Howard decided to embrace the accidental fame. He then capitalized on his physique by setting up a Facebook page to advertise his services as an impersonator. The page boasts that he is \"the closest thing you get to the 'Dear Leader' without actually going to North Korea.\" \"The key to becoming him is to always look unhappy and dissatisfied. It is his trademark look,\" Howard says as he walks the streets of Hong Kong, capturing the attention of confused onlookers. \"It is fun to play Kim Jong Un because it freaks people out. It freaks people out that they can't believe the dictator is in this part of the world. It is great being Kim Jong Un, but it is always nice to go back home and just be myself,\" he added.

While everyone has their own unique personality and way of using an app, there are a few types of people who tend to dominate an internet community. And Snapchat is no exception. Which one of these Snapchat types sounds most like you? 1. The Ghost You signed up for Snapchat and never post, but rather, you prefer creeping on other people\u2019s snaps. You often swipe through very late at night, during the witching hour, and never snap back. 2. The Conversationalist You try to engage in real, meaningful conversations over Snapchat about politics, religion, relationships or society at large. Of course, you often forget what the question was by the time you get a response. 3. The Gym Rat You're super proud of your body, and you think other people should be too. Your snaps are 100%, pure muscle, baby, characterized by setting every ab-selfie to the full 10 seconds, so everyone can take it all in. 4. The Karaoke Artist Even if you don't have a great singing voice, you like to think of yourself as a star. And Snapchat is the place to live the dream. Every snap is an opportunity to star in your own lip sync music video. 5. The Selfie Obsessed What is Snapchat if not the extension of the self? What is the self if not the selfie? If people didn't want to see your face on Snapchat, they wouldn't swipe, so you're really just giving the people what they want, plus duckface and filters. You love the filters. 6. The Animal Lover You love social media. Mainly because it's the best place to show off your adorable dog or cat. Or bunny. Or fish (hey, to each their own). And your friends mostly follow you for this very reason and you'd hate to let them down. 7. The Foodie Have you tried that new restaurant in town? Of course you have. And all your friends know about it because they saw your entree from seven different angles plus a selfie of you drinking your cocktail using that dog filter. It was hysterical, we're sure. If there is one thing people just love on social media, it's pictures of other people's food in grainy, low lighting. 8. The Paint Dryer You're bored, and thanks to Snapchat, you're making sure we're bored with you. No matter where you are: at work, the airport, on vacation, you're sister's baby's first birthday or just hanging out at home, we know that you've got one, reliable wavelength: Ennui. 9.

The New York/Chicago rivalry over whose pizza is \"best\" will never be resolved, and politicians have been mocked for taking fork and knife to a slice. Perhaps even more contentious than these is the question of pizza-blotting\u2014is it a culinary crime to dab at the grease atop a pizza with a napkin? Either way, there's some good news for blotters: blotting the oil off the top of pizza does make it measurably healthier. Shockingly, federal funding for research into pizza nutrition has been limited, so there\u2019s no strict scientific consensus on how many calories make the jump from pizza to paper towel when a slice is blotted. The closest approximation comes from the Food Network\u2019s series Food Detectives. Host Ted Allen and a team of researchers from Popular Science came up with the figure of \"35 calories per slice on average (3.5 grams of oil).\" CNN\u2019s Dr. Roshini Raj gives a similar appraisal: \"You are probably cutting 20 to 50 calories a piece \u2013 not a whole lot, but [...] if you have a couple of slices, it adds up.\" With an average slice of cheese pizza weighing in at 272 calories, blotting off 35 calories per piece equals a 13% reduction. Nutrition-savvy readers might recognize that 35 calories also equates to 1/100th of 3,500 calories: the number doctors generally agree equals one pound of human fat. An infographic by Labdoor Magazine gets a little bit more realistic with its calculations, using a slice of Domino\u2019s pepperoni pizza as its standard and calculating total calorie reduction over a year based on the national average for pizza consumption: 23 pounds of pizza for every American. According to those calculations, blotting off the pizza grease can soak up 6611.2 calories in a year, or nearly two pounds\u2019 worth of fat. Of course, there are caveats to the pizza blotting strategy. Along with fatty orange oil slicks, an injudiciously applied napkin might remove a pizza\u2019s seasonings or take a bit of cheese and sauce with it, so it\u2019s a choice that shouldn\u2019t be made lightly.

Matthew Pugh, 27, was arrested on November 30 on charges of attempted homicide, aggravated assault, simple assault, and reckless endangerment, after allegedly attacking the elderly woman in the lobby of a high rise, according to the Observer-Reporter. Police say that Clinton supporter Pugh and the woman were discussing the recent election in the lobby of the building back on November 20 when the woman either spoke against Hillary or made a favorable comment about Trump, sending the younger man into a rage. He allegedly picked up a chair and hit the old woman in the head, opening a gash in her forehead. Pugh was said to have knocked the woman to the floor, and she suffered additional injuries in the fall. Officials report that both the elderly woman and her attacker were taken to Monongahela Valley Hospital for treatment of injuries suffered in the fight. He initially fled the scene and was not arrested for over a week. After his arrest, the suspect was sent to Washington County jail on $50,000 bond and will next appear in court on December 14.

Brock Turner has been in jail for just three months of the pathetic six-month sentence he was given, but he Brock Turner has been in jail for just three months of the pathetic six-month sentence he was given, but he will walk free next week thanks to a revolting mix of white privilege and a lie he told during his trial about his drug use. Apparently, this horrible 21-year-old pervert is getting off on \"good behavior\" and because he had said he was new to alcohol and drugs at his trial in June, which was found to be false after some of Turner\u2019s photos and texts were discovered. Even more revolting is that the court seems to be taking his probation far more seriously than the fact that he is a convicted rapist. Turner had tried to portray a clean image in court when he said things like, \"Coming from a small town in Ohio, I had never really experienced celebrating or partying that involved alcohol.\" However, his old texts, some dating back to 2014, show this misogynist saying things like: \"Do y\u2019all n****s have marijuana\", talking about how he\u2019s \"wanting a blaze\" [joint] and chides a friend for \"burning through the green\" [weed]. Other older messages show Turner using the N-word a lot, especially when trying to meet up with others to do drugs. One message said, \"Swag. Should I just meet y\u2019all n***** there?\" Now that this evidence emerged, Turner has admitted to drinking heavily and using LSD \u2013 a lie that has landed him a three-year probation term \u2013 which seems pretty f****ed up considering he only did 3 months in jail for doing one of the most violating things imaginable. He will serve his probation from the comforts of his parents\u2019 home in Dayton, Ohio, because apparently in America, monitoring someone\u2019s drug use is more important than serving time after you rape a human being.

An alarming new study shows that it\u2019s not just cancer, heart disease and other ailments we have to worry about when it comes to smoking: lighting up can also alter our DNA. A new study has found that smoking alters more than 7,000 genes in ways that may contribute to the development of these diseases, and don\u2019t go away completely even when we stop smoking. Scientists based their conclusions on results from blood samples taken from 16,000 people in 16 other studies, finding that those who stopped smoking saw their genes recover for the most part within five years of quitting, showing that the sooner you stop smoking, the better. But the research team, led by Dr. Stephanie London of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Science, also found that some genetic changes remains 30 years later, according to the study. The researchers looked at a process called DNA methylation, which are genetic changes that don\u2019t alter the underlying cold but can change how they are expressed. Decades after smokers quit, there was still a higher long term risk of common smoking related diseases. \"We used a pregnancy cohort called the Norwegian Mother and Child Study, or MoBa2 for short,\" London said in a recent podcast. \"And we used cord blood samples from the study. Cord blood is collected at birth from the baby, so it\u2019s the baby\u2019s DNA. And we looked at whether there are methylation changes that are related to whether or not the baby\u2019s mother smoked. And we were very interested to find, even though we looked in a very hypothesis-free way, that some of the genes that came to the top were ones that we had previously known were very important in the response to compounds that are in tobacco smoke, and in particular, two genes that are in the AhR signaling pathway.\"", "When we get all caught up thinking about the zombie apocalypse, the robot revolution, or something a little more realistic, like say, an antibiotic-resistant superbug that could seriously wipe millions of us out, we're talking small-time 'end of the world' stuff. Robots might rise up against us and destroy humanity forever, but the world will keep on spinning, and the Solar System will still have eight planets (sorry Pluto). But nothing is forever, no matter how many billions of years you've existed, and theoretical physicist Brian Greene just demonstrated to Colbert how a star like our Sun will end. Now, we don't want to alarm you or anything, but at some point, our Sun is going to run out of fuel, collapse in on itself, and everything we know and love will die. If you have kids, that's something you maybe want to give the delicate 'birds and the bees' treatment to when it comes time to explain that little nugget of truth to them, lest they end up like one of Louis CK's daughters, when he decided to marvel at the incredible, flaming violence of it all: \"She started crying immediately, crying bitter tears for the death of all humanity... and now she knows all of those things: she\u2019s gonna die, everybody she knows is gonna die, they\u2019re gonna be dead for a very long time, and then the Sun\u2019s gonna explode. She learned that all in 12 seconds, at the age of seven.\" The sad futility of existence aside, the science behind how and why a star millions of times more massive than our Sun implodes in on itself is fascinating, and nobody explains it as clearly as Greene in the video above. And he takes things one step further, by bringing a record-breaking Galilean canon into the studio to demonstrate just how far the shockwaves of destruction will emanate from a dying sun. Dude makes breaking a world record look suspiciously easy. Watch the video above to find out more about our ultimate demise, and check out this video by Physics Girl if you can't get enough of those stacked balls: Correction: The story has been corrected to make clear that the star Greene talks about in the video is much more massive than our own Sun.", "Meet Jazz Egger, a 19-year-old model originally from Austria who currently resides in London. A few months ago, Egger downloaded the dating app Tinder, and claims to have racked up the most matches ever. How many are we talking? A whopping 5,400. \"I travel a lot and people keep Super Liking me [every Tinder user has one Super Like to give away per day],\" Jazz explained to FEMAIL. While receiving a Super Like became a \"normal\" occurrence for Egger, FEMAIL reveals that the average female user receives one or two every month.  Things so outrageous for Jazz that she could no longer respond to every person's Super Like. \"I reached a point where I couldn\u2019t answer everyone anymore, because I [had] swiped right on every Super Like,\" she said. Now, Egger includes a message in profile explaining that even if you express interest through your use of a Super Like, it doesn't mean that she will be able to get in touch with you. \"Sorry this is getting out of hand. I can\u2019t answer everyone anymore,\" her message reads. \"I only reply if your message is super interesting. Hope you understand.\"  In addition to receiving a ton of attention from people trying to match up with her, Jazz also gets some insane offers from those who do get to the interaction stage. \"I even matched with Conor Maynard and other well known musicians, YouTubers, and actors,\" she said. \"Another crazy offer was when a guy invited me for a week in Greece on his yacht.\" ", "Searching for a new job is a tedious process. But one of the worst parts is learning a position you wanted was filled before you ever even got a chance to interview. If you find yourself in that situation over and over again, you want to figure out whatever's holding you back so you can address it ASAP. But, the truth is: There's no one size fits all solution to guarantee you'll get an interview. Sometimes a pretty minor change (like proofreading) will make the difference. Other times, you need to revamp your overall strategy. And it can be hard to know where on the spectrum you fall. That's why I've put together five questions in order from the smallest changes required to the largest so you'll know whether your job search needs some tweaks or an overhaul. I suggest you read them in order, and if the answer is yes, make that change. If it's no, keep reading to see if something bigger is what's holding you back. 1. Are There Glaring Errors In Your Materials? Wouldn't anyone know you meant program manager and not porgram managger? Maybe so, but there are three big reasons why typos hold you back: They show poor attention to detail (which is called for in most positions). They make it look like you rushed to put something together (and don't really care about the position). They don't get picked up by applicant tracking systems (so you'll rank lower when a recruiter searches for relevant resumes). Yes? Fix It Take a stab at looking for mistakes yourself. Do this on every application, every time. Better yet, ask a friend to review materials for typos or grammatical errors. A fresh set of eyes may be the answer to finding mistakes. 2. Is Your Cover Letter Like Everyone Else's? Maybe you know your resume, cover letter and introductory email are flawless, because you use the exact same, perfect one for all positions. Sadly, this strategy will backfire. Remember, the job description outlines exactly what the company is looking for in their ideal candidate, so it includes clues as to which of your strengths you should mention in your cover letter. If your application looks the exact same before you've found the role, after you've read about it, and when you're ready to hit submit, you might be doing something wrong. Yes? Fix It A great way to stand out is to write a strong opening line. Skip I am excited to apply for this position and share something specific about why you're drawn to the position or why your skills would help you excel in the role. 3. Do You Simply Send Off Your Application And Wait? Many people fail to realize that there's more to getting an interview than simply pressing submit. In fact, the majority of the work is done after the application's sent in. Pressing submit is equivalent to placing your resume on a recruiter's desk, only to have a slew of resumes dumped on top of it seconds later. By simply waiting for them to find your materials on their own, you risk the chance that they may never even see it in the first place. Yes? Fix It The key to getting someone's attention is to reach out to them. Send a short LinkedIn message or an email informing a recruiter or hiring manager that you applied and ask for the opportunity to interview. It should look like this: Dear , I hope you're doing well! I recently applied to a Program Manager position at your company and would be grateful for the opportunity to interview with you. I have over  years of leadership experience, have managed a variety of projects throughout my career and truly believe that I would be an asset to your team. Please let me know if you'd be open to discussing the position with me in more detail. Thanks in advance for your time and consideration, Some may say this approach puts you at risk of becoming the annoying candidate but, as a former recruiter I can tell you that one follow-up email isn't bad (Note: I said one). It shows you're interested, and if your resume did fall through the cracks, you'll have gotten the other person's attention. 4. Have You Kept Your Job Search A Secret? I get it: You don't want to bother your friends, so you figure you'll wait until you actually land an interview to mention you applied at their company. Or, you're uncomfortable sharing that you've been looking, because so far you feel like you don't have anything to show for it. However, it's often easier to secure an interview when you're referred internally. So, speaking up earlier will increase your chances of getting your foot in the door. Yes? Fix It When reaching out, take the time to research their company first, and have a target position in mind before asking for their help. This way you can ask for their assistance with securing an interview for your target position, instead of simply asking them to let you know if their company is hiring. (While being non-specific might seem nicer, the latter approach puts the responsibility on them to find a position that suits you, which translates to more work on their part.) 5. Are You Being Realistic? Sometimes your ambition leads to applying for positions you don't minimally qualify for. It's OK to apply to some stretch positions, but those should not make up the majority of what you're going after. If everything you're aiming for would require a leap of faith from the hiring manager, you shouldn't be entirely surprised you're not hearing back. Yes? Fix It This is a great time to employ the 80-20 rule. If you want to make two out of every 10 positions you apply for a reach, go for it; but the other eight should be roles where you meet all of the minimum qualifications and can easily make a case for why you're a solid candidate. It's not easy to take an honest look at the things you may be doing wrong after you've been trying your best all along. But becoming aware of the obstacles standing in your way is the essential first step to finding a solution. Once that's completed, the next steps are execution and accountability and I know you've got that. 5 Fixable Job Search Mistakes That Are Holding You Back From Interviews was originally published on The Daily Muse. Rudy R. Racine is a Growth Coach & Founder of HireLearners and writes for The Muse.", "Dustin Kennerley tried to quit smoking three times over the course of two years. The constant cravings and intense withdrawal symptoms made it impossible to get through the day without thinking about cigarettes, he said. \"I was very angry all the time, very edgy, very irritable about everything,\" said Kennerley, a linguistics student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. \"I lasted about three days and went and bought a pack of cigarettes.\" If, like Kennerley, you're having trouble kicking your cigarette habit, your brain might be to blame, according to new research on mice published in the journal Current Biology. Scientists at the Brudnick Neurophsyciatric Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Medical School have pinpointed specific areas in the brain that could be responsible for nicotine withdrawal symptoms like nausea, headaches, irritability and weight gain that make it so difficult to go cold turkey. About 69 percent of smokers say they want to quit smoking, but nicotine, the drug in tobacco products, may be as addictive as heroin and cocaine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. \"We\u2019re trying to understand what chronic nicotine [use] does for the brain that makes it hard to quit,\" said Andrew Tapper, PhD, a neuroscientist at UMass and co-author of the new study. Kennerley is a case in point. \"I'd smoke one or two [cigarettes] and then throw them away and be mad at myself,\" he said. \"[Smoking], that's all I could think about. It's such a strong craving.\" Why Is It so Tough to Quit? In an effort to understand nicotine addiction, Dr. Tapper's team gave mice nicotine-laden water for six weeks until their brains, much like human brains, were hooked on the chemical. Then they took the nicotine water away and watched as the mice went through their own version of withdrawals: excessive grooming, scratching, digging and shaking. The researchers looked at the mice brains and found activity within the interpeduncular nucleus, an area deep under the cortex in the middle of the brain. \"We found that when you get an animal dependent on nicotine and you take it away, this little brain region became overactive,\" said Tapper. The nicotine in cigarettes is a highly addictive chemical because when you smoke a cigarette, the nicotine travels to your brain and attaches itself to a nicotinic receptor. Those receptors then release a chemical called dopamine, which is also released after other fun things, like having sex or eating cupcakes. Dopamine makes you feel good, and your brain associates those good feelings with smoking. Quitting is challenging because the brain becomes accustomed to constant doses of nicotine. If you stop smoking, the drug leaves your system, and neurons in the interpeduncular nucleus trigger withdrawal symptoms \u2014 irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating and weight gain \u2014 that might prompt you to smoke again. \"Even though you tell yourself, 'No, no, no,' your brain will find a way to convince you [smoking] is a good idea,\" said Kennerley, who finally gave up cigarettes in 2009 after many attempts. \"It feels like your brain is tricking you. It will convince you against better judgment that [smoking] is what you want.\" Smoking Addiction Kills When Tapper activated neurons in the interpeduncular nucleus region in mice who weren't addicted to nicotine, they, too, started exhibiting withdrawal symptoms. This suggests that there's a strong connection between the this area of the brain and the negative side effects of nicotine detox. If scientists could figure out how to placate these neurons and get rid of those withdrawal symptoms, more people might give up the habit, they theorize. \"[This research] is important for people who have a very hard time quitting,\" said John Dani, PhD, a neuroscientist and nicotine addiction expert at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. \"I've seen people standing outside in their hospital gowns smoking a cigarette \u2014 they just can't quit.\" Tobacco use costs the U.S. $97 billion in lost productivity, and contributes to 5 million deaths worldwide every year. Statistics show that smokers die more than 10 years earlier than non-smokers. \"Adverse health consequences of smoking make it the most preventable cause of mortality in the world, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re working on it,\" Tapper explained. Tapper's research is still preliminary and was conducted only in mice, but it seems to be a meaningful step forward that could provide targets for stop-smoking drug development, said Dr. Dani. \"This circuitry is working in a way that's helping to perpetuate [smoking]. The brain has been tricked into thinking [smoking] is valuable, and that's how addiction starts,\" Dani said. \"The better we understand how these circuits shape behavior, the more likely we are to be able to control them.\"", "UPDATE: Shortly after Tina Fey's interview made the Internet rounds, Colin Quinn took to Twitter to apologize for the incident. \"Statement: It's all true,\" he tweeted. \"I have used profanity when I've been angry at people. When I was wrong (as with Tina) I've said sorry to them.\" Good move, Colin. PREVIOUSLY: You don't become one of the most successful stars in Hollywood without stepping on a few toes along the way.

In an interview on Sirius XM's \"The Howard Stern Show,\" Fey, a frequent guest on the boundary pushing radio hour, told the host that an \"SNL\" co-star once called her \"a c**t.\" She was initially reluctant to give up the name of her famous detractor, but with a little cajoling from Stern, she revealed Colin Quinn was the culprit.", "Michel de Nostredame, usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French physician and astrologer who lived in the 16th century. According to his followers, he predicted a lot of things that have actually happened in the last few centuries; including the French Revolution, Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power and 9/11. There is even evidence of him predicting Trump\u2019s presidential win, whom he referred to as \"the great shameless, audacious bawler\". His prophecies, which he wrote in four-line verse, are of course open to interpretation \u2013 but here are some verses that could possibly shed a little light on what we can expect in 2017:  For forty years the rainbow will not be seen. For forty years it will be seen every day. The dry earth will grow more parched, and there will be great floods when it is seen. The great man will be struck down in the day by a thunderbolt. An evil deed, foretold by the bearer of a petition. According to the prediction another falls at night time. Conflict at Reims, London, and pestilence in Tuscany. Shortly before sun set, battle is engaged. A great nation is uncertain. Overcome, the sea port makes no answer, the bridge and the grave both in foreign places. Pestilences extinguished, the world becomes smaller, for a long time the lands will be inhabited peacefully. People will travel safely through the sky (over) land and seas: then wars will start up again. Letters are found in the queen's chests, no signature and no name of the author.

This was pretty much revealed in a post-earnings call, where company CFO Blake Jorgensen goes over some sales figures they\u2019re predicting with the upcoming World War 1 game when it hits. \"We\u2019ve told people that typically a Battlefield title does about 15 million in a year,\" Jorgensen said. \"Our guidance is slightly under that. And we hope that that excitement builds and it will clearly go through that number. But for right now, it\u2019s slightly under that number.\" He also details a little info on Titanfall 2\u2018s predicted sales figures, in which he claims it will outsell it\u2019s predecessor. This isn\u2019t too surprising, however, considering Titanfall was an Xbox One exclusive, and the sequel is coming to all three platforms (XB1, PS4, PC). He says it\u2019ll probably sell close to 10 million. \"We think it\u2019ll do more than that, but it\u2019s probably closer to 10 million than it is to 15 million as built into our guidance, so closer to 9 million to 10 million on [Titanfall 2] and just under 15 million on Battlefield 1.\" Interestingly, the two shooters will be released with a week of each other, with Battlefield 1 coming on October 21st and Titanfall 2 October 28th. Something to note is that it seems EA has both fan bases covered this year, with Battlefield being your boots on the ground, and Titanfall 2 being your more futuristic game. Activision has something similar planned, however. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare covers futuristic gameplay, with the Modern Warfare remaster being the boots on the ground. Something else to note is that Infinite Warfare preorders are dominating that of Battlefield 1\u2018s, despite its trailer being the second most disliked video on YouTube. Funny how the world works.", "Scientists have discovered a massive asteroid that is on course to hit the Earth next week, and are scrambling to find a way to divert the object. The asteroid has been named 2016-FI and measures approximately 1 km across. If it strikes a populated area is could wipe out entire cities and potentially devastate an entire continent or ... nah. I\u2019m totally messing with you. There\u2019s no asteroid (at least not about to strike next week). But there is a new study by computer scientists at Columbia University and the French National Institute that has found that 59 percent of links shared on social media have never actually been clicked, meaning that most people who share news on social media aren\u2019t actually reading it first. For the study, Arnaud Legout and co-authors collected two data sets: \" the first, on all tweets containing Bit.ly-shortened links to five major news sources during a one-month period last summer; the second, on all of the clicks attached to that set of shortened links, as logged by Bit.ly, during the same period. After cleaning and collating that data, the researchers basically found themselves with a map to how news goes viral on Twitter. The map showed \"viral\" news is widely shared but not necessarily read. According to the Washington Post, one thing study authors say is concerning about this is that it shapes the way we see the world. Legout said in a statement: \" \"People are more willing to share an article than read it. This is typical of modern information consumption. People form an opinion based on a summary, or a summary of summaries, without making the effort to go deeper.\" This probably won\u2019t shock most people. We see it all the time in comments sections \u2013 people making loud proclamations about stories they clearly haven\u2019t read. Entire discussions are chaired by those who didn\u2019t actually RTFA (Read the Fucking Article). It\u2019s maddening. What can you do about it? RTFA, of course, and don\u2019t share things you haven\u2019t read. Being informed is being responsible. So, have you made it this far or are you busy building a makeshift shelter in your basement? If you read it, and want to comment, work a colour \u2013 red, blue, yellow, pink, whatever \u2013 into your comment, would you? But don\u2019t ruin the headline for everyone else, OK? Thanks.

There are a few science-backed reasons for this, but perhaps the most interesting is the theory of \"misattribution of emotions,\" which basically says that we stick whatever emotion we\u2019re feeling to our impressions of the people and events around us. (This also explains why jamming at a great concert might trick you into thinking you\u2019re in love with the average-looking lead singer.) It\u2019s easy to associate an adrenaline rush with the same excitement you feel when you\u2019re crushing hard on someone. In Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior by Ron and Ori Brafman, researchers had men cross two different types of bridges to get a woman's number. Of the 16 dudes who crossed a secure wooden bridge, only two ended up calling the woman. However, half of the 18 men who crossed a shaky suspension bridge followed through with a call. ...horror films can actually make you more attractive to the opposite sex. Affectionately called \"the love bridge\" in the psychological community, the study shows it\u2019s easy to associate an adrenaline rush with the same excitement you feel when you\u2019re crushing hard on someone. So basically, anything that gets us amped makes us more physiologically aroused (is this why I\u2019m always so horny on roller coasters?) study from the late 80s explains it differently. Scientists Dolf Zillmann and Norbert Mundorf found that horror films can actually make you more attractive to the opposite sex. Researchers paired male undergrads with female partners and showed them a 14-minute clip from Friday the 13th Part III. The men reported enjoying the film almost twice as much if the female showed distress during the film, while the women said they liked the film more if their male companion acted calm and collected. Men were initially considered unattractive were later judged more appealing if they displayed courage.", "So what might work to close the gap? Social scientists and policy makers have some ideas, as do companies that have been trying to combat the problem in their work forces. Publish Everyone\u2019s Pay When employers publish people\u2019s salaries, the pay gap shrinks. Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Washington University, has found that salary transparency raises wages, in part by lending legitimacy to employees\u2019 arguments in wage bargaining. \"Even being cognizant of gender pay disparity being an issue can change norms,\" he said. That has been true in the public sector, where disclosing pay information is often required. Alexandre Mas, an economist at Princeton, studied the effects of a 2010 California law that required cities to publish municipal salaries. It prompted pay cuts, but only among men. Women might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower, he theorized, or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits. A few European countries have required that big companies publish pay information by sex. President Obama in 2014 required that federal contractors report it to the Labor Department. Other American companies say they have analyzed pay this way, though most do it privately. Marc Benioff, the C.E.O of Salesforce.com, said last year that after such an analysis, the company spent $3 million to make women\u2019s salaries equal to men\u2019s. Kimberly-Clark and PricewaterhouseCoopers have said their examinations led managers to address the fact that fewer women were reaching top positions. To Negotiate, or Not Men are paid more partly because they\u2019re much more likely to ask for it. When receiving job offers, 51.5 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women asked for more money, according to a study of Carnegie Mellon University graduate students by Linda Babcock, an economist at the university. In other research, she found that when women did ask, they asked for 30 percent less than men requested. Because starting salaries determine raises and future salaries, women who do not bargain lose as much as $750,000 for middle-income jobs and $2 million for high-income jobs over their careers, Ms. Babcock found. But her research and that of others has found that women are penalized for negotiating, while men are rewarded for the same behavior. (As the actress Jennifer Lawrence wrote in Lenny after the Sony hacking revealed that she was paid less than her male co-stars, she didn\u2019t fight for more because \"I didn\u2019t want to seem \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018spoiled.\u2019 \") One solution, Ms. Babcock said, is to coach women to negotiate. Another is to change corporate practices so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocates for women during negotiations. Another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely. That is what Ellen Pao did when she was chief executive of Reddit. The company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers. \"We put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidates to negotiate fair pay,\" Ms. Pao wrote in The Hollywood Reporter. Don\u2019t Rely on Previous Salaries If women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries. Google has said it does this and instead makes offers based on what a job is worth. In August, the federal Office of Personnel Management said government hiring managers could no longer rely on an employee\u2019s previous salary when setting his or her new one. The acting director, Beth Cobert, explained that the practice particularly disadvantaged women who had taken time off to raise children. Women are also more likely to have worked in the lower-paying public or nonprofit sectors. \"Don\u2019t ask about salary history for new hires, and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination,\" Ms. Babcock said. \"I think that is the most effective thing organizations can do.\" Make Work Easier for Mothers Research has found that salaries at men and women\u2019s first jobs out of school are fairly similar. The gender pay gap widens a few years later when women start having children. Sometimes their pay lags because they take breaks from work when their children are young, work fewer hours or take more time off than men for child care crises. Sometimes their employers assume they\u2019ll do so, even if they don\u2019t. Policies that help keep women in the work force, like affordable child care, paid sick days and parental leave, could help. In states that offer paid parental leave, for instance, mothers are more likely to return to work, work more hours and earn higher wages, economists have found. \"If a cashier gets pregnant, has no parental leave, has to leave and reapply for her job, that\u2019s not the same as making a career choice,\" said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. \"One thing policy can do is make it easier for women to stick with their careers.\" Build More Flexible Workplaces Ms. Goldin of Harvard has found that the pay gap is largest in occupations with the least flexibility in terms of where and when people work, like finance and medicine. The gap shrinks when people can work on their own schedules, as in many tech jobs and when people can easily substitute for one another, as happens among pharmacists. Then, women aren\u2019t penalized as much for working fewer hours. Companies might address the culture of face time and overwork, and change how they operate. In a pharmacy, for instance, electronic medical records have made it easier for different pharmacists to serve the same patient. Change the Law Federal law doesn\u2019t require most of these things, so some lawmakers are trying other tactics. The strongest equal pay bill in the country went into effect in California this month. It says that men and women must be paid the same for similar jobs, not just for exactly the same job at the same site, as the looser federal Equal Pay Act requires. The California law also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for discussing pay. Proposed federal legislation known as the Paycheck Fairness Act would require companies to report pay data to the government, give grants for negotiation training and make class-action lawsuits easier. But that legislation is stalled in Congress.", "PALM SPRINGS, CA (HH) -- According to patients at the Center for Restorative Medicine, a new discovery has completely transformed their lives. Founder and Director Dr. Steven Gundry is a world-renowned heart surgeon, a best-selling author, and the personal physician to celebrities such as Tony Robbins. But his latest medical breakthrough could be the most important accomplishment of his career. In a dramatic press conference yesterday, Dr. Gundry unveiled a simple \u2014 yet highly effective \u2014 solution to symptoms that plague millions of Americans over 40: low energy, low metabolism and constant fatigue. He went on to say that persistent fatigue can be a warning sign for much more serious health problems...including diabetes, obesity, hypertension and heart disease. \"When you\u2019re feeling low energy, that\u2019s your body screaming HELP!\" He told the crowd of reporters and medical professionals. Dr. Gundry\u2019s radical solution was inspired by a breakthrough with a \"hopeless\" patient who had been massively overweight, chronically fatigued and suffering from severely clogged arteries. The secret to his breakthrough? \"There are key \u2018micronutrients\u2019 missing from your diet,\" Dr. Gundry told the room. \"If you can replenish them in very high dosages, the health results are astonishing.\" This unorthodox philosophy is what led Dr. Gundry to create the world\u2019s first at-home treatment for fatigue \u2014 which has since become remarkably successful with his patients. \"They\u2019re reporting natural, long-lasting energy without a \u2018crash\u2019 and they\u2019re feeling slim, fit and active,\" he revealed yesterday. The science behind his formula is brand new, and was met with both fascination and enthusiasm by those in attendance. Immediately following the announcement, Dr. Gundry\u2019s team released a comprehensive video presentation, so that the public can be educated as to exactly how it works. Watch the presentation here: Within just a few hours, this video had gotten thousands of hits, and is now considered to have gone viral. One viewer commented: \"If this works, it\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been praying for my whole life. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this solution before...the truth about my diet was shocking and eye-opening.\" Of course, Dr. Gundry\u2019s announcement was met with some hesitation. We spoke to some of the doctors who attended the press conference, who advised that people keep their expectations realistic. \"It makes a lot of sense, and it sounds great in theory,\" said Dr. Michael Griffin, a nutritionist based in San Diego. \"But we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the results are. Knowing Dr. Gundry, however, there is a great deal of potential.\"", "Even before being tapped as director of the new \"Blair Witch\" sequel, Adam Wingard had already earned respect as one of the top helmers in the horror genre with films like the \"V/H/S\" series and \"You\u2019re Next.\" With \"Blair Witch,\" Wingard has taken on his first franchise after years of delivering original material, with hopes that fans of the 1999 box office sensation, as well as brand-new filmgoers, show up to theaters. Prior to its opening, Wingard spoke with Variety about the film, including how the filmmakers were able to keep the project secret for so long. Caution: There may be minor spoilers ahead. After several original projects, why did you want to make \"Blair Witch\" your first branded property? (Screenwriter) Simon (Barrett) and I had been talking for a couple of years, after doing \"You\u2019re Next,\" \"The Guest,\" and even \"A Hard Way to Die,\" and felt that we needed to make a more straightforward horror film. We\u2019re known for being horror filmmakers but we\u2019ve never really committed to making a full-on horror movie \u2014 most of them are meta deconstructions or half-comedies, things that have horror elements or stylizations like \"The Guest.\" We felt that we were due to do one and wanted to prove  we could do a straightforward horror movie, but we didn\u2019t have a firm idea of what that was. Flash forward to 2013 and we\u2019re about to go off and do \"The Guest.\" Lionsgate is about to release \"You\u2019re Next,\" and we happened to be in Sundance and ran into (original \"The Blair Witch Project\" director) Eduardo Sanchez and (producer) Greg Hale. We happened to ask Eduardo about how the found footage thing went through a whole cycle and he felt it was time for \"Blair Witch\" to make its comeback as a sequel, reboot, remake, or something along those lines. It was weirdly in the air enough and we sensed something. Two weeks later, Lionsgate called Simon and me in for this secret meeting and wouldn\u2019t tell us what it was for. Once we showed up, they told us they had the rights to \"The Blair Witch\" and were interested in making a sequel with us. They had not gone out to any other filmmakers and we were the guys they were interested in, specifically because of our jump-scare driven segment in \"V/H/S 2.\" Instantly the nostalgia of the original film flooded back and all the mythology came to me immediately about Ruston Parks, things I haven\u2019t thought about in years but I was immediately talking about it and the ideas I had for it, and I just wanted to make it a slightly bigger version of \"The Blair Witch Project,\" where the scale was a little bit bigger. It was one of those things where it was the right place at the right time \u2014 we didn\u2019t know exactly what we wanted to do, but we knew we wanted to do something, and that ended up being \"Blair Witch.\" What did you want to add more of that wasn\u2019t in the original and conversely, what did you want to keep intact from the first film? The main thing we wanted to keep from the original is its commitment to authenticity. The first film is a sort of sparse character study of people getting lost in the woods and there just happens to be some supernatural occurrences that get stronger as the film goes on. For me, I wanted to take that world that they had built and I wanted to take the audience on this roller coaster version of it because that\u2019s how I felt when I saw it the first time. I\u2019m drawing back on that nostalgia from watching it in high school and thinking what would I want to see out of this sequel that I never got. That\u2019s a really pure thing to build a drama from as a filmmaker, that teenage thought process. You\u2019re never going to get full ideas from it but the emotionality is almost always correct and that\u2019s the audience you\u2019re going for. Since it is a found footage movie, cameras are an essential part of the storytelling since you are showing the audience the cameras. How did you decide what kind of cameras to use? When we were gearing up in pre-production, we did a ton of tests. We tried the real Bluetooth cameras the characters wore, but unfortunately we couldn\u2019t shoot with those, because they would look like basically a Sega CD. We knew this was the right idea, that kind of discreet approach to cameras. It took a lot of extensive testing because it was really important to me that we didn\u2019t actually light the movie like a movie. I wanted the nighttime footage to be pure dark and that means flashlights would be a key component to the look and feel of the movie, which is a lot harder than it sounds, honestly. The flashlights that you want to use that put out the right kind of light are LED light, which means that a lot of them have a weird flicker thing on the camera\u2019s shutter and they end up producing this pulsing pattern that\u2019s really annoying. So what we ended up doing was buying a ton of flashlights and a ton of different cameras and we were rigorously doing all these tests to see which ones hold up the best. For the earpiece camera, there wasn\u2019t just one camera we used for the film, we had one that worked for nighttime \u2014 the Sony a7S which was basically the hero camera, and for daytime we had this totally bizarre camera that was a little lower res because we knew when it was daytime we didn\u2019t want as much sharp detail. We wanted to have a more grainier and shittier look especially on sunny days so it doesn\u2019t look too clean. The cameras you see on screen aren\u2019t necessarily the ones we are filming with. I hate it when you are watching a movie where the characters are on the news and for some reason they shoot it with a 35mm camera or a 4K camera and they just put it on the TV as if that\u2019s the way it would look \u2014 it always takes me out of it by putting a filter on certain things. If it\u2019s too high quality, you\u2019re never gonna buy it. Are there a lot of CGI effects? I love going on IMDb message boards and there are some hilarious things that go on there \u2014 the most negative people on the planet. I remember seeing one person\u2019s thread complaining about when you see the witch in the film that it was the worst CGI ever created and I just go, \"buddy everything you see in this film is real, there is no CGI in the movie.\" The only time any kind of post effects were utilized were mainly just straightforward pan outs and a couple displays that the cameras were looking at that we had to add and that was still more takeaway then adding anything. The glitches were enhanced in post as well, but anything you see on screen is real, the gore, anything in the woods... That thing she pulls out of her leg? That\u2019s really a prosthetic built over the actor\u2019s leg and that\u2019s her really pulling something out of it. For the most part, it\u2019s all old-fashioned tricks just done in a new way or new perspective because of found footage. The witch is never shown in the original \u2014 how decide whether to show her and how you wanted her to look? The main thing that was important to me was that we couldn\u2019t do what the original film did and have another movie where you don\u2019t see any evidence at all of the supernatural stuff, so we knew we had to show something in this film. I knew that everyone would have an interpretation of the witch or the thing that\u2019s out in the woods and I didn\u2019t want to ruin that. So we tried to design a sort of Lovecraft-style thing that would hopefully hold up under scrutiny even if you are freezing the frame whenever the film is released on video and stuff. Everyone these days is on Tumblr and you know they are making GIFs of movies and making these still-frame collections of films, so I knew someone would create a still frame thing of every shot of the witch in the film or whatever people think that is, so I wanted that to hold up. Did you expect to be able to keep the film secret all the way up until the Comic-Con presentation? I was completely blown away that we kept it a surprise. Simon and I were signed on to this thing since February 2013, so it\u2019s been like three years that we have kept this thing under our hat. We haven\u2019t even been able to say the words \"Blair Witch\" out loud in fear of someone picking up on it and we\u2019re constantly looking over our shoulder at restaurants. The main thing we did to keep it secret was to never acknowledge it in any kind of way. We had it on lockdown, even at Lionsgate, about what movie we were making, but eventually some rumors leaked online. Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting somehow caught wind of it and of course since we have a relationship with Brad from the \"V/H/S\" films, it looked like we leaked it, but we didn\u2019t. So he ended up putting this article out while we were filming, saying \"The Woods\" is \"Blair Witch\" and everyone should be excited, but the funny part is that the reaction was hilarious because everyone in the commenting section was like \"Shut the hell up, Brad.\" I think there were like 50 messages saying he was wrong and no one picked it up, and we also never acknowledged it. And by not acknowledging any of the rumors it ended up going away. Even now it seems that it\u2019s an obvious choice to make this film but, say, a year ago, it would have seemed completely insane, because nobody was thinking this was going to happen anytime soon. So, long story short, the secret to keeping the secret was just not ever acknowledging that there was a even a secret.", "Richard M. Nixon told an aide that they should find a way to secretly \"monkey wrench\" peace talks in Vietnam in the waning days of the 1968 campaign for fear that progress toward ending the war would hurt his chances for the presidency, according to newly discovered notes. In a telephone conversation with H. R. Haldeman, who would go on to become White House chief of staff, Nixon gave instructions that a friendly intermediary should keep \"working on\" South Vietnamese leaders to persuade them not to agree to a deal before the election, according to the notes, taken by Mr. Haldeman. The Nixon campaign\u2019s clandestine effort to thwart President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s peace initiative that fall has long been a source of controversy and scholarship. Ample evidence has emerged documenting the involvement of Nixon\u2019s campaign. But Mr. Haldeman\u2019s notes appear to confirm longstanding suspicions that Nixon himself was directly involved, despite his later denials. \"There\u2019s really no doubt this was a step beyond the normal political jockeying, to interfere in an active peace negotiation given the stakes with all the lives,\" said John A. Farrell, who discovered the notes at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library for his forthcoming biography, \"Richard Nixon: The Life,\" to be published in March by Doubleday. \"Potentially, this is worse than anything he did in Watergate.\" Mr. Farrell, in an article in The New York Times Sunday Review over the weekend, highlighted the notes by Mr. Haldeman, along with many of Nixon\u2019s fulsome denials of any efforts to thwart the peace process before the election. During a phone call on the night of Oct. 22, 1968, Richard M. Nixon told his closest aide (and future chief of staff) H.R. Haldeman to \"monkey wrench\" President Lyndon B. Johnson's efforts to begin peace negotiations over the Vietnam War. His discovery, according to numerous historians who have written books about Nixon and conducted extensive research of his papers, finally provides validation of what had largely been surmise. While overshadowed by Watergate, the Nixon campaign\u2019s intervention in the peace talks has captivated historians for years. At times resembling a Hollywood thriller, the story involves colorful characters, secret liaisons, bitter rivalries and plenty of lying and spying. Whether it changed the course of history remains open to debate, but at the very least it encapsulated an almost-anything-goes approach that characterized the nation\u2019s politics in that era. As the Republican candidate in 1968, Nixon was convinced that Johnson, a Democrat who decided not to seek re-election, was deliberately trying to sabotage his campaign with a politically motivated peace effort meant mainly to boost the candidacy of his vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey. His suspicions were understandable, and at least one of Johnson\u2019s aides later acknowledged that they were anxious to make progress before the election to help Mr. Humphrey. Through much of the campaign, the Nixon team maintained a secret channel to the South Vietnamese through Anna Chennault, widow of Claire Lee Chennault, leader of the Flying Tigers in China during World War II. Mrs. Chennault had become a prominent Republican fund-raiser and Washington hostess. Nixon met with Mrs. Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador earlier in the year to make clear that she was the campaign\u2019s \"sole representative\" to the Saigon government. But whether he knew what came later has always been uncertain. She was the conduit for urging the South Vietnamese to resist Johnson\u2019s entreaties to join the Paris talks and wait for a better deal under Nixon. At one point, she told the ambassador she had a message from \"her boss\": \"Hold on, we are gonna win.\" Learning of this through wiretaps and surveillance, Johnson was livid. He ordered more bugs and privately groused that Nixon\u2019s behavior amounted to \"treason.\" But lacking hard evidence that Nixon was directly involved, Johnson opted not to go public. The notes Mr. Farrell found come from a phone call on Oct. 22, 1968, as Johnson prepared to order a pause in the bombing to encourage peace talks in Paris. Scribbling down what Nixon was telling him, Mr. Haldeman wrote, \"Keep Anna Chennault working on SVN,\" or South Vietnam. A little later, he wrote that Nixon wanted Senator Everett Dirksen, a Republican from Illinois, to call the president and denounce the planned bombing pause. \"Any other way to monkey wrench it?\" Mr. Haldeman wrote. \"Anything RN can do.\" Nixon added later that Spiro T. Agnew, his vice-presidential running mate, should contact Richard Helms, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and threaten not to keep him on in a new administration if he did not provide more inside information. \"Go see Helms,\" Mr. Haldeman wrote. \"Tell him we want the truth \u2014 or he hasn\u2019t got the job.\" After leaving office, Nixon denied knowing about Mrs. Chennault\u2019s messages to the South Vietnamese late in the 1968 campaign, despite proof that she had been in touch with John N. Mitchell, Mr. Nixon\u2019s campaign manager and later attorney general. Other Nixon scholars called Mr. Farrell\u2019s discovery a breakthrough. Robert Dallek, an author of books on Nixon and Johnson, said the notes \"seem to confirm suspicions\" of Nixon\u2019s involvement in violation of federal law. Evan Thomas, the author of \"Being Nixon,\" said Mr. Farrell had \"nailed down what has been talked about for a long time.\" Ken Hughes, a researcher at the Miller Center of the University of Virginia, who in 2014 published \"Chasing Shadows,\" a book about the episode, said Mr. Farrell had found a smoking gun. \"This appears to be the missing piece of the puzzle in the Chennault affair,\" Mr. Hughes said. The notes \"show that Nixon committed a crime to win the presidential election.\" Still, as tantalizing as they are, the notes do not reveal what, if anything, Mr. Haldeman actually did with the instruction, and it is unclear that the South Vietnamese needed to be told to resist joining peace talks that they considered disadvantageous already. Moreover, it cannot be said definitively whether a peace deal could have been reached without Nixon\u2019s intervention or that it would have helped Mr. Humphrey. William P. Bundy, a foreign affairs adviser to Johnson and John F. Kennedy who was highly critical of Nixon, nonetheless concluded that prospects for the peace deal were slim anyway, so \"probably no great chance was lost.\" Luke A. Nichter, a scholar at Texas A&M University and one of the foremost students of the Nixon White House secret tape recordings, said he liked more of Mr. Farrell\u2019s book than not, but disagreed with the conclusions about Mr. Haldeman\u2019s notes. In his view, they do not prove anything new and are too thin to draw larger conclusions. \"Because sabotaging the \u201968 peace efforts seems like a Nixon-like thing to do, we are willing to accept a very low bar of evidence on this,\" Mr. Nichter said. Tom Charles Huston, a Nixon aide who investigated the affair years ago, found no definitive proof that the future president was involved but concluded that it was reasonable to infer he was because of Mr. Mitchell\u2019s role. Responding to Mr. Farrell\u2019s findings, Mr. Huston wrote on Facebook that the latest notes still do not fully answer the question. The notes, he wrote, \"reinforce the inference but don\u2019t push us over the line into a necessary verdict.\" Critics, he added, ignore that there was little chance of a peace deal, believing that \"it is irrelevant that Saigon would have walked away without intervention by the Nixon campaign.\" In effect, he said, \"they wish to try RN for thought crimes.\" An open question is whether Johnson, if he had had proof of Nixon\u2019s personal involvement, would have publicized it before the election. Tom Johnson, the note taker in White House meetings about this episode, said that the president considered the Nixon campaign\u2019s actions to be treasonous but that no direct link to Nixon was established until Mr. Farrell\u2019s discovery. \"It is my personal view that disclosure of the Nixon-sanctioned actions by Mrs. Chennault would have been so explosive and damaging to the Nixon 1968 campaign that Hubert Humphrey would have been elected president,\" said Mr. Johnson, who went on to become the publisher of The Los Angeles Times and later chief executive of CNN. Mr. Farrell found the notes amid papers that were made public by the Nixon library in July 2007 after the Nixon estate gave them back. Timothy Naftali, a former director of the Nixon library, said the notes \"remove the fig leaf of plausible deniability\" of the former president\u2019s involvement. The episode would set the tone for the administration that would follow. \"This covert action by the Nixon campaign,\" he said, \"laid the ground for the skulduggery of his presidency.\"", "NBC has ordered a \"Murder, She Wrote\" reboot starring Oscar winner Octavia Spencer, The Huffington Post has confirmed.

Huge. It's so huge, in fact, that it doesn't actually orbit the sun. Not exactly. With 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets in the solar system combined, it's big enough that the center of gravity between Jupiter and the sun doesn't actually reside inside the sun \u2014 rather, at a point in space just above the sun's surface. Here's how that works. When a small object orbits a big object in space, the less massive one doesn't really travel in a perfect circle around the larger one. Rather, both objects orbit a combined center of gravity. In situations we're familiar with \u2014 like Earth orbiting the much-larger sun \u2014 the center of gravity resides so close to the center of the larger object that the impact of this phenomenon is negligible. The bigger object doesn't seem to move, and the smaller one draws a circle around it. But reality is always more complicated. For example: When the International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth, both the Earth and the space station orbit their combined center of gravity. But that center of gravity is so absurdly close to the center of the Earth that the planet's motion around the point is impossible to spot \u2014 and the ISS describes a near-perfect circle around the whole planet. The same truth holds when most planets orbit the sun. Sol is just so much larger than Earth, Venus, Mercury, or even Saturn that their centers of mass with the sun all lie deep within the star itself. Not so with Jupiter. The gas giant is so big that its center of mass with the sun, or barycenter, actually lies 1.07 solar radii from the middle of the sun \u2014 or 7% of a sun-radius above the sun's surface. Both the Sun and Jupiter orbit around that point in space. This not-to-scale gif from NASA illustrates the effect: That is, in essence, how Jupiter and the sun move through space together \u2014 though the distances and sizes are far different. Jupiter is still only a fraction of the sun's size. But next time someone asks you for a crazy space fact you'll know: Jupiter is so massive, it doesn't orbit the sun.", "After waking up almost entirely paralyzed in the hospital about 20 years ago, Ken Worrall asked to be disconnected from his life-giving machines. But, as he explains in the YouTube video above, online gaming eventually gave him a sense of purpose. Worrall was on a windy construction site when his accident occurred. An incorrectly fastened air duct fell and hit a pair of two-by-fours; Worrall's helmet broke under the impact. He woke up able to move only his eyes. Blinking in a yes-or-no binary code was initially his sole form of communication. His father persuaded him to give it time. Some time later, he was introduced to the Jouse, a mouth-operable mouse that made computer use accessible. Worrall began playing \"Diablo,\" and he was hooked. Known online as \"No Hands Ken,\" Worrall streams his play live to a mass audience via Twitch. By placing the Jouse in in his mouth and puffing it, he is able to right-click; by \"sipping,\" he can left-click. According to a Reddit AMA he held after his story's release on YouTube, it took Worrall about a month to master gameplay with the Jouse. And now hundreds of thousands of people have seen him play. Worrall never expected to catch people's attention -- or hearts -- in the way he has. When asked during his Reddit AMA how many people he expected to watch him, he wrote, \"Maybe thirty?...

Maybe a job driving the Big Idaho Potato Truck is the career you\u2019ve been looking for. The promotional vehicle, which consists of a semi cab hauling a 12-foot-tall replica potato, travels around the United States to draw attention to the prize spuds of Idaho. Operated by the Idaho Potato Commission, the truck is currently on its fifth annual tour of the country. Funding concerns mean this could be the last year, but a recent, unexpected endorsement from Kobe Bryant\u2014he name-dropped the truck in an ESPN interview\u2014may have helped secure its future. To find out what life on the road with the Big Potato is really like we spoke with Larry Bathe, who is not only the current driver of the trailer, but has been with the project since the very beginning. The Big Idaho Potato Truck first hit the road in 2012, as a promotional tour commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Idaho Potato Commission. As Bathe told us, the idea for the truck came from Linda Kaufman of marketing company Foerstel Design, who was inspired by an old novelty postcard that showed an impossibly massive potato on the back of a flatbed. Bathe, a lifelong truck driver, was brought in to help figure out exactly how to create and pilot a giant potato around the country. Originally, the huge tater was set to be 16 feet tall, and hold a museum inside, but at that scale it wouldn\u2019t have fit under most bridges. The potato creators scaled the tater back to its current 12-foot-tall size, and began to test drive it, which is when Bathe first took the wheel. The truck did its first nine-month tour in 2012, mostly visiting grocery stores to hand out information on Idaho spuds. That was supposed to be the extent of its service celebrating the Potato Commission\u2019s anniversary, but the vehicle proved so popular that it was allowed to hit the road again in 2013. More and more venues began requesting that the truck make an appearance, from Nascar events to the Kentucky Derby. After the Big Idaho Potato Truck\u2019s second tour it had gained so much notice that the program was given a three-year contract, 2016 being its final guaranteed year. \"Some people love it in the commission, and some people don\u2019t, or at least they act like they don\u2019t,\" says Bathe. \"But in the end we win them over pretty easily.\" Despite yearly funding worries, the Big Idaho Potato Truck continues chugging along. Having turned down the first two tours to be with his family, Bathe returned to the truck tour in 2014. He has driven the potato every year since. According to Bathe, driving around with the heavy carb load is both challenging and rewarding. The potato is 12 feet wide and 28 feet long, making it nearly impossible to see what\u2019s directly behind it. \"It\u2019s difficult for mirrors to see behind it, so I don\u2019t have an idea of the traffic pattern [behind the truck],\" says Bathe. Turning the huge tater is also a challenge, that Bathe nearly always has to navigate by instinct and experience. But the driver of the Big Idaho Potato Truck is not alone. There are also two other \"ambassadors\" on board who look after the logistics of the tour. In addition to the responsibility to interact with the public that each of the potato team shares, one of the ambassadors takes care of photography, video, and other documentation, while the other looks after social media and managing the venues and locations. It takes a team to drive a six-ton potato. All three of the team ride in the cab while they are on the road, but the Big Potato itself isn\u2019t empty. \"You can\u2019t have something that can\u2019t be inspected inside, be as big as that potato,\" says Bathe. To allow for this, there is a door in the potato that leads to the hollow insides which have been fitted with shelves and lockers for the potato team to store their stuff. Even with the close quarters and the challenges of driving a giant potato around, Bathe loves his gig. \"The amount of people that wave at you every day when you\u2019re driving the Big Idaho Potato is just outrageous,\" he says. \"I get thumbs up, waves, people taking pictures. It\u2019s just a feel-good job.\" Since each year could possibly be the last for the truck, its overseers have ended up filling the positions last minute. But Bathe hopes that this will change as the popularity of the Big Potato Truck grows, along with its crew. Oscar Mayer\u2019s promotional, giant-hot-dog-shaped Wienermobile is 80 years old, Bathe points out. The Big Potato \"is just five years old. It\u2019s just getting going.\"", "Well according to sources close to the Queen, she was just following her royal protocol.

Redmond (via its flacks) has e-mailed The Register \u2013 and, we presume, World+Dog \u2013 to say that the UI had worked like that for ages: \"the UI of our \u2018your upgrade is scheduled\u2019 notification is nothing new (including the ability to just \u2018X-out\u2019 of the notification with no further action needed to schedule your upgrade) \u2013 it\u2019s been part of the notification UI for months\" (their emphasis, not ours). In this Knowledge Base article, Microsoft notes that \"Based on customer feedback, in the most recent version of the Get Windows 10 (GWX) app, we confirm the time of your scheduled upgrade and provide you an additional opportunity for cancelling or rescheduling the upgrade.\" +Comment: You'll have noticed that Microsoft didn't say it would re-write the app so that closing the app is taken as a \"no\", as happens for just about every other dialog Windows offers. Or is Redmond saying users who didn't like the UI sleight-of-hand are at fault for delving into its Knowledge Base every time they find a dialog confusing?

Visit The Register's hub", "As humans, we tend to set goals throughout our entire lives and dedicate most of our time trying to achieve them. That gives us purpose and motivation to strive forward. Yet, it can have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals. As psychologist Karl Weick suggests in his article \"Small Wins,\" we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make. By taking the Alcoholics Anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective. Instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions: The impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety. By celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal. The Dangers of Dreaming Big We are encouraged on a daily basis to \"dream big\" and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things. This phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived. There is nothing wrong in the saying itself, yet it tends to be misinterpreted by us, the regular mortals who are fascinated by fairy tale stories of dreams that come true to those who are brave enough to wish and focus on the ultimate goal. For every great achievement ever made, there have been a million of small wins and breakthroughs that gradually led there, and this is something many people tend to overlook when working on achieving their goals. If we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear: Our sense of self-worth can be worsened We risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress We are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can\u2019t be achieved The increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health Once we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health. By focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more. Understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health. Here is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins: Step 1: Start small First of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it. It sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done. Instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day\u2019s challenges only. Be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward. This will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem. Step 2: Reflect often Every once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress. So often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place. This means comparing yourself \u2014 with yourself. For example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones. By doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions. Step 3: Reward yourself From early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement \u2014 reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation. Therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize. If the reward doesn\u2019t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile. So, next time when you catch yourself single-mindedly chasing a complex goal without appreciating the small wins, give yourself a break and treat yourself to a movie, favorite sweet, or a short trip with your friends. Step 4: Enjoy the process Maybe the most important element to keep in mind in order to maintain mental strength in a competitive and goal-oriented world is to remind yourself to be content with yourself and the goals achieved. Remember to have fun and not take yourself too seriously. Enjoy experimenting and growing. By appreciating the process and the lessons learned, you will be able to avoid the stress and negative emotions, even if you don\u2019t achieve the ultimate goal.

The Mississippi-native thought she had reached the end of a marathon with the birth of her three baby girls. After all, doctors told her she would be expecting identical triplets, which was a shock to the mom of one 10-year-old daughter. But after the third baby was delivered, they realized a fourth was hiding behind her three sisters. \"They had got the three out and they said, 'More feet,'\" Fugate told Good Morning America. \"'More feet' ... that's all I heard and I said, 'Nooo!'\" Though once unexpected, Kenleigh Rosa, Kristen Sue, Kayleigh Pearl and Kelsey Roxanne are now known as the \"Fugate Four\". The girls were born 13 week premature Just a day before Fugate's 42nd birthday, each weighing about two pounds. They'll have to remain in observation at University of Mississippi Medical Center until May. According to the New York Daily News, giving birth to four identical babies is rare. Only 60 cases have been documented in medical history. Even Fugate's doctor, Dr. James Bofill, was shocked -- and embarrassed. It was his fellow that told him of the fourth baby. \"We\u2019ve seen quadruplets here before, but we\u2019ve never seen identical quadruplets,\" Bofill told the Clarion Ledger. \"That\u2019s what makes this case so unique and unusual.\" Despite their stream of surprises, the family's joy for the girls is no secret. Kimberly, her husband Craig and the quads' big sister Katelyn, age 10, created a Facebook page called \"Fugate Quadtruplets\" to keep well-wishers in the loop. It has over 53,000 likes. The girls are still in the hospital, but the Fugate family has posted an update with their improvements. On Valentine's Day they posted a photo of the babies with the caption \"Our Sweet Valentines!\" Indeed, those are sweet gifts that not even chocolate can top. Still, Mom knows what she can handle. \"This. Is.

It seems that way, but when Aaron Krane tried to purchase his last car via a dealership's website, he quickly learned that although he knew exactly what he wanted to buy, he still needed to physically go into the store to complete the purchase.  Krane couldn't find a way to buy a car online anywhere, as such functionality was yet to exist in the automotive industry. As a serial entrepreneur who was part of the core team at Slide (which was acquired by Google), the founder of Hitpost (acquired by Yahoo!), and EIR at Khosla Ventures, Mr. Krane knew a disruptable industry when he saw one. Aaron Krane, pic via Drive Motors It was with this in mind that he created Drive Motors, the Silicon Valley startup which builds e-commerce solutions for auto dealerships.  Drive Motors powers dealerships to sell directly through their websites, providing them with a buy online button. The company is backed by Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures, and Propel Venture Partners. All the trials and triumphs of building a business  delivered to your inbox. By offering a solution which modernizes the 100 year old automotive industry, you would think it would seem easy to build momentum. However, in order to gain traction, Drive Motors first needed to educate the dealership community on why now is the time to embrace e-commerce, and how it would help-- not replace-- the current dealership model. This is a challenge many startups face when they are seeking to introduce new technology solutions to an industry with a strong legacy processes.  It requires a company to uniquely become the expert voice of the very industry they are trying to change. Over 150 stores currently use Drive Motors' online checkout, and dealership volume has doubled nearly every month for the last three.   So what are some of the lessons learned about how to market innovation to an industry that may or may not be ready to embrace it? Know Your Audience:  According to Krane, developing a true connection and empathy for your target customer is critical, even if the temptation might be to rush to market with what you perceive as the 'right' solution. If you want to solve a problem, spend ninety-five percent of your time researching the problem, and five percent of your time designing the solution.  Krane and his team spent approximately nine months researching and observing the inner-workings of dealerships, which allowed them to be laser-focused on the exact needs and attributes of his customers.  tRelationships Matter:  In the world of digital marketing, it may seem that online connection is the only tactic needed to engage customers. Not true, according to Krane. Our head of dealership success and I flew from San Francisco to Atlanta for a single day, just to say hello and check-in with a large customer with whom we were piloting. We returned from that trip with an expanded pilot program, and two months later, we onboarded the entire group.  Why? It's important to interact directly with your customers on a frequent basis, and invest resources in keeping them happy. tBecome An Insider:  Once you know your audience, and you've developed relationships with them, leverage key introductions and customer references to become a trusted player in the space, said Krane. That concept of becoming a trusted brand holds true not just in business development efforts, but also in media relations, as Krane experienced.  For example,  some of his most successful media efforts have been around showcasing how he was driving value for dealerships, instead of just promoting his own product.  The result? Other inbound inquiries around how Drive Motors could help other dealerships too. Becoming a trusted brand is an ongoing effort, and sometimes requires overcoming an initial industry skepticism.  However,  as Drive Motors has found, with the three tactics above, the road becomes easier and easier. ", "Corville Cuffy just made a very surreal moment on BBC News.

Although maybe his backflip needs a bit of work...", "Tree-lined streets, good schools, quiet road and low-intensity streetlights... That last one may not have made it on your checklist for finding your last home, apartment or condo, but doctors now say it probably should have. Even though they save energy, some light-emitting diode (or LED) streetlights are too bright and may actually be putting your health and security at risk, according to new recommendations from the American Medical Association, the largest professional association of doctors in the U.S. The benefits of LED lights include a lot of energy and cost savings. They use up to 50 percent less energy than conventional lights. And the lifetime of LED lights is two to four times that of older, non-LED lights, which means lower maintenance costs for cities that need to change a street\u2019s lightbulbs when they go out. But the bottom line from the AMA is that high-intensity LED streetlights that emit too much blue light can actually throw off sleep patterns of the people living in those neighborhoods and make nighttime glare on roads worse than conventional lights. \"Despite the energy efficiency benefits, some LED lights are harmful when used as street lighting,\" Maya A. Babu, an AMA board member, said in press release. None of the authors of the AMA recommendations were answering questions on the topic, according to the press office. 'A Strip Mall In Outer Space' \"It feels like I\u2019m in a strip mall in outer space,\" Brooklyn resident Jolanta Benal told The New York Times last year, complaining about the bright LED streetlights in her Windsor Terrace neighborhood. New York City is spending $75 million to retrofit its more than 250,000 street lights to be energy-efficient LEDs, the Times reported. The new lights are expected to save the city $6 million in energy costs and $8 million in maintenance each year. But lights like these could also be costing residents like Benal a lot of sleep. The retrofitted streetlights were designed to prevent glare, according to a spokesperson for the city's Department of Transportation. But the current blue light allowance for the new street lights is higher than the new AMA recommendations call for. \"The problem is that if people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep,\" Maurice Ohayon, director of the Stanford Sleep Epidemiology Research Center, told The Huffington Post. Ohayon and his colleagues recently looked at the sleep habits and sleep quality of more than 15,800 people. They found that people who were exposed to more nighttime light were nearly twice as likely to be dissatisfied with their sleep as those living in areas with less light. Those exposed to more light at night also reported sleeping less at night and having more fatigue during the day. If people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep. Maurice Ohayon, Stanford University As that exposure to light happens over and over again, our circadian rhythms (the body\u2019s internal clock) get disrupted. And beyond affecting sleep, disordered circadian rhythms are linked to higher rates of chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, depression and some cancers. In the same way that blue light from a smartphone or computer screen suppresses melatonin production in the brain (the body\u2019s signal for sleep), it's the blue light in LEDs that causes trouble, Clete Kushida, a neurologist and sleep specialist at Stanford Sleep Medicine Center, explained in a KBCW video. Blame Light Color And Intensity There is actually no such thing as a \"white\" LED light, Stephen Quick, an architect and urban designer, told HuffPost. LED lights that appear white, like the ones used in streetlights are made up of a combination of amber, red, green and blue light, said Quick, an adjunct professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved in writing the AMA's recommendations. Quick and his colleagues took a deep dive into the research on cost-saving benefits and potential health, safety and aesthetic concerns of LED lights for a report for the city of Pittsburgh in 2011. The report was used to help Pittsburgh finalize its plan to replace its 40,000 streetlights. That research, like the new AMA recommendation, suggested that a neutral color light with about an even mix of blue and the other colors be used for streetlights, Quick said. \"Think incandescent light -- neither warm nor cool [in color]. It\u2019s soft, but it doesn\u2019t have the cool qualities that you\u2019d see in a fluorescent light.\" Quick said that the Pittsburgh report's recommendations did allow for slightly more blue light than the AMA. Brighter But Not Safer The other potential problem with LED streetlights that are too bright, according to the AMA\u2019s recommendation against them, is glare. \"A lot of people believe that the brighter the lights, the safer they are,\" Quick said. But LED light is directional -- meaning it gets emitted in a specific direction, unlike conventional lightbulbs, which put out light and heat in all directions. When the lights are lower consistently, we don\u2019t have the glare problem we do when they\u2019re really bright. Stephen Quick, Carnegie Mellon University Because the light is not diffused, LEDs create a \"glare zone\" for drivers at certain angles that can be worse than conventional streetlights, Quick said. The new AMA recommendations encourage \"proper design, shielding and installation\" to help mitigate glare. Quick also said that dimming the lights would help reduce glare. \"The higher the intensity, the more glare from the bounced light or the direct light,\" he said. \"And when the lights are lower consistently, we don\u2019t have the glare problem we do when they\u2019re really bright.\" The Cost Of Evolving Standards The AMA's new recommendations may call for some rethinking of current green building standards and projects. The U.S. Green Building Council -- the group that runs LEED, the most widely used green building certification program in the world -- does not support one specific type of streetlight over another, Theresa Backhaus, a site technical specialist for LEED, told HuffPost via email. \"We encourage lighting design to take all considerations into account for the health, safety and welfare of people and the environment,\" she said. USGBC's Light Pollution Reduction Credit was created precisely to reduce the harmful effects of light pollution, she said. The credit is one that buildings and development projects can meet to earn one of LEED's four rating levels. That credit requires projects to use lower lighting levels for \"sensitive areas,\" such as residential zones and nature preserves, but does not specify a limit on the amount of blue light that can be used. The good news is that most LEDs, especially newer ones, are made with dimming controls, Quick said -- so the intensity of the light can be adjusted fairly easily. Changing the color balance of the lights can be a lot more difficult. Sometimes it's possible to replace just the LED themselves, Quick said, but sometimes the whole fixture needs to be replaced. \"And that gets costly.\" The takeaway is that there\u2019s nothing inherently bad about the LED lights themselves. \"We save a tremendous amount of energy by using them. We also save a lot of money in maintenance costs,\" Quick said. But getting the color and intensity right is important. \"The best procedure right now is for cities to be cautious and know what they\u2019re buying,\" he added.", "This Olympic runner has a famous mom, and you won\u2019t believe who it is This Olympic runner has a famous mom, and you won\u2019t believe who it is More Kate Grace is an Olympic runner for Team USA.

Quartz reporter Mike Murphy compiled a new collection of data showcasing the price of video game consoles, adjusted for inflation. The results certainly put the $599 Oculus Rift into perspective, as the all-time priciest system is the relatively obscure Neo Geo, which launched in 1990 for the equivalent of $1,179 today. (It was $649.99 back then.) Take a look: At least you were getting your money's worth from the Neo Geo. Somewhat unbelievably, the system was still supported as late as 2004, when its final game -- \"Samurai Shodown V Special\" -- was released. The chart also reveals that Nintendo systems have always been pretty good values. All things equal, Nintendo consoles fall toward the bottom of the list, perhaps because the company places such emphasis on first-party software like \"Mario Kart\" and \"Super Smash Brothers.\" The company makes a lot of money on its own games and original properties, in other words. Some might complain Nintendo's systems also seem a bit outdated by the time they're released -- in terms of sheer horsepower, the Wii lagged behind the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, much as the Wii U is technically less impressive than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Still, kids might do well to take this list to heart when composing their birthday wish lists. \"But mom, the Wii U is a good value, I swear!\"", "ABC Family is \"ABC Family\" no more. The network has chosen a new name, in the hopes of shedding what it seems to have deemed an unfairly wholesome reputation: \"Freeform.\" \"Our core viewers know what to expect from our content,\" Network President Tom Ascheim told LA Times. \"But among nonviewers, there\u2019s a very different perception of our brand. We over-indexed on two adjectives: one was family-friendly and the other was wholesome. It led us to believe that the huge perception gap is based on our name.\" Ascheim told LA Times that the network is shifting its focus away from the millennials, whom they\u2019ve successfully courted for over a decade, and instead looking at people ages 18 to 34\u2014a life stage they describe as \"becomers.\" Indeed, the days are long gone when squeaky-clean programming ruled their lineup. Glossier shows like Pretty Little Liars now dominate instead. One of the network\u2019s recent shows featured a protagonist who was fresh out of five years in juvie. The network has changed a lot\u2014including its name, multiple times\u2014since it was founded in 1977 as an arm of the Christian Broadcasting Network. (The 700 Club, a Christian talk show and one of the network\u2019s oldest programs, still airs on the network.) Back then, it was called the CBN Satellite Service. The name morphed to CBN Cable Network, then to CBN Family Channel, then to the Family Channel (FAM). Over that time, the channel gradually folded more and more secular programming into its lineup\u2014when it became the Family Channel in 1990, only 25 percent of its schedule was devoted to spiritual programming. In 2001, it became ABC Family. Since then, the network has been inching toward edginess, pushing against the constraints of its family-friendly rep. In 2006, ABC Family adopted the slogan \"A New Kind of Family,\" and introduced programming like sci-fi drama Kyle XY. In 2007, we got the bubbly college-centric series Greek, and in 2008, the trailblazingly sympathetic portrayal of teen pregnancy in The Secret Life of the American Teenager. Then, in 2010, Pretty Little Liars made its debut.", "WHAT TO DO To get your heart racing and boost your overall fitness, try skipping, advises Nadya Fairweather, founder of u-shape.co.uk. The benefits of even a few minutes a day are huge \u2014 it strengthens bone density, tests endurance and improves agility. Buy a skipping rope (\u00a32.99, sportsdirect.com). Set up a timer and see if you can skip for 30 seconds. The key is in the wrist \u2014 flick the rope around quickly by rotating your hand. You should jump so low your feet should barely come off the floor. Try skipping on one foot for five, then switch to the other foot for five, and keep alternating. For beginners, start with five minutes a day, then work up to 15.  WHAT TO EAT Cardio exercise such as skipping requires a healthy heart. Foods that can help this include omega 3 essential fatty acids such as oily fish, flax and chia seeds. These help reduce fats in the blood and provide anti-inflammatory support. And you should stock up on avocados. They are rich in potassium, which is important for blood pressure, but they also contain mono-unsaturated fats that support cardiovascular health. For a healthy snack, eat an apple. They can help lower bad cholesterol in the body and keep arteries healthy. High grade 70 to 80 per cent cocoa has also been linked to lowering blood pressure.

I\u2019d been traveling a fair bit during the rush of primary season, and you start to feel unstuck when you do that. The moments of my days I would have otherwise spent doing soothingly banal things \u2014 grocery shopping, hand-washing delicates, pouring Drano into various plumbing orifices \u2014 I now spent alone in hotel rooms, contemplating the Donald Trump phenomenon. I\u2019d seen glints and glimmers of his wide swath of support \u2014 the man in New Hampshire who was following Trump around the country, hawking merchandise; the friendly middle-aged women in Iowa who just liked his style; the Oklahoma couple at a Bernie Sanders rally who, after a few minutes of pleasant chitchat about Sanders, started talking to me about their deep admiration for and likely support of Trump. But the thesis was still missing for me: Why him? Why these people? Mulling over these questions has pretty much become the primary occupation of politicos. Jamelle Bouie of Slate wrote that it was a consequence of President Obama\u2019s upending the country\u2019s racial hierarchy. Scott Winship at National Review chalked it up to a more generalized national anxiety disorder. Samantha Bee did her own twist on a focus group with young Trump voters. \"I don\u2019t like the way they\u2019re stabbing each other in the back.\" So she wouldn\u2019t be voting for Trump, then? \"No, I didn\u2019t say that.\" There were other theories too, based on more empirical thinking. The Upshot found that areas of Trump support overlapped with places that had high concentrations of people who ethnically identified as \"American.\" A doctoral student theorized that Trump supporters had a bent toward authoritarianism. Recent political science fieldwork seemed to suggest something different: that his supporters are more raging populists than autocrats. They weren\u2019t rallying around a figure who consolidated power in a chaotic vacuum, they were thrilling to the words of an instigator. What I kept returning to, though, was the surprise of it all. Polling\u2019s long arm, we were promised, could reach farther than any reporter into the brambles of American politics and retrieve what was difficult to see from the outside: the hidden proclivities and preoccupations of demographic groups. Political science, in turn, was meant to act as a killjoy, a gulp of dusty academic air amid the breathlessness of campaign news cycles. But for months political obsessives doubted poll numbers with the strength of a thousand Thomases. The numbers said one thing, but common sense indicated otherwise. Political scientists had no perfect historical precedent to call upon. Reporters, meanwhile, had only the piecemeal musings of the voters they happened to accost at rallies and coffee shops, nothing to suggest that a new paradigm was being formed. Now Trump is the likely Republican nominee for president. Given the limitations of statistical analysis, political science and traditional reporting, I reasoned that a hybrid approach using all three could help answer the prevailing question in American politics: Why Donald Trump? On March 1 there was a Trump rally in Columbus, in a billboard-strewn no man\u2019s land by the city\u2019s airport. When I arrived that morning it was spotted with campaign yard signs and volunteers directing cars to a vast overflow lot about a mile away. In the Middle West, such parking crises are often engendered by county fairs and football games, but rarely by political speeches. I ended up in a scofflaw\u2019s spot in front of an industrial stone company and walked down the road\u2019s shoulder to where Bill and Alysha Johnson stood pointing cars toward the lot. Bill, 42, a DirecTV installer, and Alysha, 37, who stays at home with the couple\u2019s kids, had driven from their small town of 600 outside Cincinnati while it was still dark to volunteer for the campaign. Alysha\u2019s affection for Trump was simple, she said: \"He\u2019s for the working class and seems to be revealing a lot of things about the government we haven\u2019t known.\" Outsiders claiming to reveal what\u2019s really happening on the inside of the marble halls of power \u2014 that\u2019s what this election has become all about. TRUMP CRUZ KASICH 47% 27% 8% Voters who are \"angry\" at the federal governement Average of exit and entrance polls for 20 Republican primaries, through March 15; surveys tested full Republican field at the time Source: CNN \"The country is fed up with what\u2019s going on,\" Trump said in July. \"You know, in the old days they used the term \u2018silent majority\u2019; we have the silent majority back, folks.\" Outsiderism means not just skepticism about big banks and Washington politicians but wariness of other institutional pillars of American life \u2014 like the media. Alysha was spending a lot of time fact-checking the news, trying to make sure that what she read and heard about the campaign was trustworthy. \"If there\u2019s rumors that are going around, I watch them,\" she said. Alysha is not alone in her mistrust of mainstream news organizations \u2014 in 2015, only 40 percent of Americans said they trusted mass media, and that number tends to dip in election years, according to Gallup. Trump is never short of disdain for the press, particularly at his rallies; he likes to stop in the middle and direct crowds to jeer at the members of the media in their midst. When I met Joseph Youde, 24, at a Trump rally in Cedar Falls, Iowa, in January, he answered my questions \u2014 \"I like Donald Trump because we\u2019re weak,\" he said. \"I think we need a tough leader\" \u2014 then turned the questioning on me. Youde managed to be genuinely friendly while asking something along the lines of \"How does it feel to be a member of the media?\" Trump had just dispensed a few choice words for journalists during his speech: \"The press, they\u2019re the most dishonest people I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. They\u2019re disgusting.\" In Columbus, I asked Alysha Johnson what she thought about what was then Trump\u2019s most recent dust-up, his refusal to disavow an endorsement from David Duke, former head of the Ku Klux Klan. She replied, \"From what I know, that\u2019s all a lie and Hillary Clinton is actually cozy with KKK members \u2014 there\u2019s several pictures of her with them.\" If I went online and searched for \"Clinton; image; KKK member\" it would show up, she assured me. When I tried that, a picture of former West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd pecking Clinton on the cheek popped up. Byrd was indeed once a member of the KKK and had mentored Clinton in the Senate. So Alysha\u2019s claim wasn\u2019t strictly wrong, though Byrd, who died in 2010, had long ago renounced his membership in the organization. Political science has shown that Alysha isn\u2019t alone in her doubt. A 2000 study by political scientists found that Americans who have incorrect information about public discourse can be divided into two different groups \u2014 the misinformed and the uninformed. The uninformed simply don\u2019t know about a given topic; the misinformed are interested in what\u2019s going on, but their sources of information are flawed. Another study, in 2010, found that when the misinformed were told about their inaccuracies, they held onto their beliefs with all the more conviction. Something inspirational seems to be happening among the assembled \u2014 a sense of collective identity being discovered. One could forgive them that very human reaction. Anyone who has ever been chastened or embarrassed might understand the tendency toward anger or defensiveness when cornered in an argument \u2014 backing down doesn\u2019t seem viable, and that can produce unfortunate sound bites, if not glimpses into deeply held beliefs. But why the alternate news sources to begin with? \"I think on the right we\u2019ve been ignoring the mainstream media for years,\" Matt Mayer, who runs a conservative think tank out of Dublin, Ohio, told me. \"I think the real break was Rathergate. The view was that Dan Rather truly tried to alter the election by hitting Bush with that National Guard stuff, and I think that\u2019s when the right finally said, \u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019\" And that, he continued, led to the rise of sites like Free Republic and Glenn Beck\u2019s TheBlaze, with their communities of active commenters. Unfounded claims often take root and flourish. \"In some ways it\u2019s an echo chamber \u2014 some of the stuff I see I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, really?\u2019\" Mayer said. If the rumor-filled parts of the Internet were the lens through which Alysha viewed the world, then it was like looking through rose-colored stunner shades: There was an unmistakable red tinge and some bars that blocked her from seeing the full picture. Every time I go to Cleveland\u2019s art museum, I like to visit a painting called \"Stag at Sharkey\u2019s,\" by George Bellows. It\u2019s from the early 20th century, during boxing\u2019s heyday, a time when Irish and Italian prizefighters were the fierce poster boys for ethnic whiteness. Bellows\u2019s fighters are going at each other \u2014 snapping sinews and all that \u2014 but it\u2019s the crowd that always gets me. They\u2019re a mass of dark figures at the foot of the ring, and some have slashing grins, a reminder of the exhilaration of having a champion who can do what you yourself cannot. As I rounded the corner in Columbus, I found myself in an industrial alley with dozens of late arrivals streaming into an airplane hangar. I\u2019d been denied press credentials for the event \u2014 no explanation, although I\u2019d been approved for others \u2014 so I queued up in the general admission line and entered the massive space just as the national anthem was starting. The assembled crowd of about 5,000 was reverently quiet \u2014 a massive flag billowed, police officers and firefighters stood at attention, and the sickly gray sky seemed more like swirling marble than the dull harbinger of rain it had been only moments ago. Something stirred deep beneath my layers of reportorial cynicism; I got chills. This part of the appeal of Trump rallies is not talked about much. Most reports on the events detail incidents of violence, and that is because they are numerous: In North Carolina, a 78-year-old man recently punched a black protester in the face and said he wanted to kill him; a rally in Chicago was canceled outright because of scuffles between Trump supporters and protesters; a man was punched and kicked repeatedly during an Arizona rally last weekend. Trump leverages the power of this violence \u2014 he recently said that if he isn\u2019t nominated at the Republican Convention in July, \"I think you\u2019d have riots.\" TRUMP CRUZ KASICH RUBIO Under $50k 49% 15% 3% 17% $50k+ 50 15 8 16 Candidate support by income Among registered Republicans, surveyed Feb. 24-27; survey tested Carson, not shown Source: CNN Along with the fighting, though, something inspirational seems to be happening among the assembled \u2014 a sense of collective identity being discovered. In this millionaire cosmopolitan who has married two immigrants, the threatened silent American majority has found its champion. Trump supporters feel America\u2019s national identity is threatened in 2016; a RAND survey of likely Republican voters found that those who strongly agreed with the statement \"Immigrants threaten American customs and values\" favored Trump at a rate of 60.1 percent. Ruth Albert, a 65-year-old retired postal worker whom I met outside a Trump event in Exeter, N.H., in February, told me that Trump\u2019s immigration policy was a big reason she was attracted to him. \"Why should people sneak in?\" she said. Albert herself is a descendant of Josiah Bartlett, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and lives in the family\u2019s ancestral home. David Merritt, managing director at Luntz Global, a political consulting firm known for its focus groups of Republican voters, says many Trump supporters reject the notion that their views are racist. \"These people were actually surprised,\" he told me. \"They said, \u2018Why would you think we\u2019re racist because we want to protect America? When Muslim terrorists want to come into America and blow up our buildings and kill us, why is keeping them out racist?\u2019\" TRUMP CRUZ KASICH High school/ some college 53% 30% 10% College 34 31 18 Candidate support by education Among likely Republican primary voters, for the week ending March 13; survey tested Rubio, not shown Source: Reuters The Upshot\u2019s look at the geography of Trumpism showed a number of variables linked to areas of deep Trump support \u2014 counties where a high proportion of the population is white with no high school diploma, where there are large numbers of mobile homes, and where there is a poor labor-force participation rate. Political scientists Michael Tesler and John Sides recently pointed to new research that shows \"both white racial identity and beliefs that whites are treated unfairly are powerful predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primaries.\" This is in no small part because of Trump\u2019s virtuoso dog-whistling \u2014 it\u2019s a thing to behold, almost as if he\u2019d grabbed the slender wrists of the crowd with those big hands of his, felt for the pulse of their darkest hearts and then whispered the words they so long to hear. While containing no overt racial slurs, Trump\u2019s stump speech is cleverly coded. Trump has offered people something more potent than party allegiance: empowerment. \"Do we love our police?\" Trump asked in Columbus to big cheers. The line is simple but cuts to something much deeper: Republicans, the majority of whom are white, have consistently reacted quite differently from Democrats to the recent spate of racially charged police killings. On March 15, when Ohio voters cast their ballots, I went to a polling place at Our Lady of Angels in the West Park neighborhood of Cleveland, where many of the city\u2019s police officers live and just a mile and a half from the park where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot and killed by a police officer in November 2014. There, Katy Gallagher, 55, told me that while she had voted for Hillary Clinton, many cops and firefighters she knew in the neighborhood were switching their allegiances. \"A lot of them are voting Trump because of immigrants getting jobs \u2014 which is surprising because they\u2019ve always voted Democrat,\" she said. A 58-year-old West Park voter named Eileen who declined to give me her last name said she was supporting Trump because of the energy he\u2019d injected into the race. \"I found it to be very exciting,\" she said. \"I paid more attention to this than any other year before. I watched all the debates.\" She had voted for President Obama in the previous election. This is something she has in common with a lot of Americans. Sides and Tesler cite the work of political scientists James Stimson and Christopher Ellis, who have found that those who identify as conservatives often take liberal positions on things like the size of government. These voters are \"symbolically conservative\" but \"operationally\" liberal. According to Stimson and Ellis, that group made up nearly 25 percent of the electorate in 2008. Trump\u2019s views on trade, which National Review called \"silly and illiterate\" are old-school-Democrat ones \u2014 globalization is really screwing over the little guy, huh? The idea that Trump could pick up white support that might typically go to Democrats in states like Ohio has become a truism of the 2016 race, though he lost the state to its governor, John Kasich, in the March 15 primary. \"I am a commonsense conservative \u2014 Is that OK?\" he asked the Super Tuesday crowd in Columbus. Trump has taken on the patina of conservatism, despite lacking a conservative orthodoxy. Trump has offered people something more potent than party allegiance: empowerment. Bernie Sanders is presenting something similar, though his message is more catholic in its demographics; John Kasich speaks about empathy as a balm for the scathed electorate; but Trump\u2019s silent majority, a mostly white, working-class cohort, wants to talk about their problems for once. The morning after Super Tuesday I headed west on I-90, hugging the curves of Lake Erie. John Kasich, consummate moderate and the zip-up sweater\u2019s greatest proponent since Mr. Rogers, was speaking in Grand Blanc, a suburb of Flint. I had met Trump supporters, but wanted to see how Republicans outside his base were thinking about him. While Trump seems to have something of a ceiling of support \u2014 his best showing was 49.3 percent of the vote in Massachusetts, but he has received an average of 34 percent \u2014 most Republicans seem to agree that Trump will be the GOP nominee. In a new poll, only 10 percent still thought he was \"not very or not at all likely\" to get the nomination. TRUMP CRUZ KASICH 40% 27% 12% Voters who \" feel betrayed by Republican politicians \" Average of exit and entrance polls for 13 Republican primaries, through March 15; surveys tested full Republican field at the time Source: CNN This swift adjustment to the magical thinking of the Trump candidacy is perhaps the most astounding thing about the 2016 election. America\u2019s political sensibility has adjusted to his rhetoric as part of the new, bilious normal. What that means for the future of the Republican Party isn\u2019t quite clear, but it may be that many of its voters, even the moderate ones, are looking for a bit of a crack-up, a revolution they never knew they wanted until Trump walked into their lives. \"I\u2019m looking for a candidate that\u2019s kind of a moderate,\" Bonnie Guith, a retired nurse practitioner who was sitting in the back of a Grand Blanc meeting room, told me as she waited for Kasich to arrive. \"I don\u2019t like the way they\u2019re stabbing each other in the back.\" So she wouldn\u2019t be voting for Trump, then? \"No, I didn\u2019t say that,\" Guith said. She offered that Kasich might make a decent vice presidential candidate for Trump. Ostensibly, these voters were from the moderate wing of the party, yet here they were, allowing that Trump had some good points. They were the personification of America\u2019s collective brain adjusting to his reality. \"Winning begets winning,\" David Merritt had pointed out to me. \"Lots of people like being on the winning team; there are more Patriots fans than there are Cleveland Browns fans.\" TRUMP CRUZ KASICH 33% 21% 10% Voters for whom top candidate quality was \"electability\" Average of exit and entrance polls for 19 Republican primaries, through March 15; surveys tested full Republican field at the time Source: CNN Trump\u2019s eventual win in Michigan was sizable, with 36.5 percent of the vote; Kasich narrowly finished third, behind Ted Cruz. But contained in Michigan\u2019s exit polls were the same conflicted feelings that had been on display in Grand Blanc: just 20 percent of Kasich voters in the state would be happy with Trump as the nominee, while three-quarters would be dissatisfied. Last week, a group of party elites met to discuss strategies to stop Trump, including a third-party bid for president. The Washington Post reported that \"the mood of the room was muted and downbeat.\" When I talked to Matt Mayer, lanky and wry and able to cite Reagan\u2019s birthday off the top of his head, he just wasn\u2019t sure what was going to happen to the GOP. We were sitting in a Starbucks in Dublin, Ohio; arranged before him was a venti coffee and a creased copy of the Financial Times. \"Are we starting to see a split? Is the Freedom caucus \u2014 could it turn into the Freedom Party?\" he wondered. Mayer understood the Trump appeal, especially after having driven around Ohio in 2012 on a book tour; he\u2019d felt the changes coming, perhaps. \"I\u2019ve talked to everyone you can imagine that\u2019s the base of the Republican Party,\" he said. \"My God, you could see the frustration and the anger at the political actors, and he is not that. I get it.\" Mayer leaned back into his chair as an old O\u2019Jays song played over the Starbucks speakers. \"People all over the world, join hands.\" That evening I drove south from Grand Blanc to my hotel in downtown Detroit, where the streets were quiet and slushy. I lay on the bed, flipping through the channels \u2014 nothing but political coverage, nothing for me to think about but the Donald Trump phenomenon. So, why Trump after all? Even after all my time on the road, no one explanation for Trumpism seems more illuminating than the other. Voters\u2019 distrust in institutions meant news and basic facts were worthy of questioning and only the most outrageous statements had the ring of truth; working-class whites\u2019 racial anger had reconstituted their sense of identity; and their desire for the center to no longer hold meant drastic upheaval in the Grand Old Party and America. But there is no one unified theory of Trumpism. The reasons for his rise are numerous, and perhaps, in some cases, unknowable. Trump\u2019s candidacy has shown that Americans are more radical than anyone realized. My sister texted late \u2014 she was watching \"Mitt,\" the documentary about Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. The next morning, Romney was due to make a speech denouncing Trump and all he stood for. I decided to watch too. How quaint it all seemed, we marveled; four years ago, the 47 percent video had been a scandal, and now the fact that Trump had bad-mouthed the pope only days before was but a passing thing. The thought I\u2019d had in the Grand Blanc meeting room came rushing back: How powerful our minds are that we adapt to such strange circumstances so quickly.

But according new research from Vanderbilt University, it's better to get real about gaps in your re\u0301sume\u0301\u2014and being honest could actually land you the job. \"Our study provides the first-ever evidence that women who conceal personal information dramatically lower their hiring prospects,\" says Joni Hersch, professor of law and economics at Vanderbilt Law School, about women who take time away from their careers to raise kids. In other words, being forthright about stepping away from work in favor of family actually works\u2014refreshingly\u2014in women's favor. \"I was shocked by the results,\" says Hersch. Hersch and assistant professor Jennifer Bennet Shinall had 3,022 subjects act as potential employers and asked them to choose between two female job candidates. Each re\u0301sume\u0301 had a 10-year gap in job history. A personal explanation\u2014taking time off to have a child or a get through a divorce\u2014was given for some of the candidates. No explanation was given on the other re\u0301sume\u0301s. The job-searchers who gave the personal info had a 30-to-40 percent increased chance of being hired, according to the findings. \"I was shocked by the results,\" says Hersch. \"The personal information gave no indication whether the woman would be a more or less productive employee. This was entirely neutral information. Yet the number of people who preferred the woman who explained her re\u0301sume\u0301 gap was staggering.\" It makes sense when you think about it: Employers would rather know the full story than to take a gamble on an unknown risk.

Imagine you are swimming in the cool waters of a calm sea. Beneath the surface lies a field of color revealing itself and dancing in the shifting light. Then suddenly a creature from the depths appears, swimming closer and closer in a frightening blur of spindly legs and gnashing teeth. LOS ANGELES, CA (Catholic Online) - Before you get too frightened, take a breath and relax. The creature has been dead for 520-million-years, leaving you free to swim to your heart's delight. The creature, Chengiangocaris kunmingensis, or simply C. kunmingensis, has long been extinct, but a beautifully preserved fossil of the shrimplike creature's nervous system has been discovered beneath Southern China. Biologist Javier Ortega-Herna\u0301ndez explained C. kunmingensis stuck to the bottom of the sea, where it scooped food into its mouth with a large pair of legs close to its face, sported an armored head, and had a long segmented body with three or four pairs of legs protruding from each one. The fossil was discovered to have a \"ropelike\" central nerve cord that traveled the length of its body and formed nerve clusters in several areas. Researchers noted the masses, called \"ganglia,\" became progressively smaller as the central nerve cord spanned the creature's body. Interestingly, the ganglia each associated with a pair of C. kunmingensis' 80 legs. The complete specimen has been beautifully preserved (Yunnan University). Ortega-Herna\u0301ndez explained C. kunmingensis could grow up to six-inches-long and had \"at least 80 legs! ... \"Our jaws dropped when we put the specimens under the microscope and observed the fine nerves on the sides,\" he gushed. \"It was hard to believe that something so small would be preserved along with the main nerve cord, but even more so because they show a unique organization that is otherwise unknown in living arthropods.\" Until the discovery, all researchers knew of the creature had been gleaned from records of bones, teeth, shells and other organic structures since soft tissues like nervous systems and organs deteriorate at a faster rate. Ortega-Herna\u0301ndez believes the specimen had been caught beneath a fine sediment and died in an environment that did not allow oxygen to reach and deteriorate it. \"Eventually the carcasses become preserved in the fossil record, and the limited decay allows for the preservation of amazing morphological detail,\" Ortega-Herna\u0301ndez explained. The findings have been published in the science journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and images of the fossil are available at the Cambrian Creatures Gallery: Photos of Primitive Sea Life, the Image Gallery: Bizarre Cambrian Creature and the Gallery: Amazing Cambrian Fossils from Canada's Marble Canyon. --- Copyright 2017 - Distributed by THE CALIFORNIA NETWORKThat persecuted Christians may be supported by the prayers and material help of the whole Church.", "Jim Jarmusch has never seen a \"Star Wars\" film and he doesn\u2019t intend to. The \"Paterson\" director premiered his latest film at Cannes Film Festival and during an interview with Variety revealed that he hasn\u2019t seen the star of his film, Adam Driver, as the villain Kylo Ren, or any of the previous six George Lucas movies. \"No. I\u2019ve never seen any \u2018Stars Wars\u2019 films,\" said Jarmusch. \"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just a stubborn punk rock thing, where I intend to go to my grave having never seen \u2018Stars Wars.\u2019 I\u2019ve never seen \u2018Gone With the Wind\u2019 either.\" When asked if he just avoids classic films, the filmmaker replied, \"I\u2019ve seen thousands of classic movies.

I just like cinemas; I grew up in them. I love the experience of seeing films with other strangers in a dark room.\"", "Passion Pit has once again had to cancel shows, a decision that the band explained in a lengthy and intense open letter posted to the band's website on Tuesday. Frontman Michael Angelakos and his bandmates posited three main reasons for cancellations: general illness, mental illness and weather. Angelakos suffers from bipolar disorder and has dealt with serious depression and survived suicide attempts in the past, but he writes now that \"this only hurt us a few times, and it was well over a year ago.\" There are many reasons bands or artists cancel shows. Here are a few of them, many of them have applied to us: 1) General Illness. Though many bands play through illness, sometimes it\u2019s absolutely necessary to take a night off to ensure that the rest of the tour survives instead of beating your body up only to have to risk canceling more shows in the future. This is how so many singers lose their voices, or people develop long-term illnesses. It\u2019s just not worth it. 2) Mental illness. Most of our fans know about my condition but this only hurt us a few times, and it was well over a year ago, and I work my ass of to make sure I can get out on stage and tour. More on how we made up all of these shows later. 3) Weather. Outdoor stages that are built into muddy grounds have caused death (so many examples of this). Rain and electronics, as we all know, also really don\u2019t mix. Sometimes, other stationary stages are said to be \"rain or shine\" but do not actually have the capability of fully protecting the gear. As some of you may know, we lost SO much gear and money a few weekends ago due to a storm, and we\u2019re not about to mess it up on our final trek for \"Gossamer.\" That could potentially end an entire tour and then that\u2019d be it. No more touring. See you maybe in 2014. Not fun. The band stresses that they wouldn't have canceled shows if they had any other choice, but that DJ'ing in place of performing during inclement weather didn't really work out for them (they were heckled), and their equipment is too customized and expensive to risk damaging it like they did earlier this year. \"Please understand that if Passion Pit cancels a show, it\u2019s canceling a show for a damn serious reason, and we\u2019re not messing around with our fans,\" Angelakos writes. \"We\u2019re trying our hardest and we are so sorry for the inconvenience. There\u2019s only so much we can do.\" In asking fans to think before getting upset, Angelakos reminded them who really suffers when a concert is canceled: We lose the most. We lose the trust of our fans because of innocent naivete\u0301, an ignorance in regards to how these things are done. WE lose the trust of those who don\u2019t understand how many people are involved in our show, from our touring crew to local crew, how much planning goes on for months and months to prep, how much money is spent to keep the tour rolling, and how much we need to tour to make sure we can afford to put on the show we want to do and still end up being able to pay our bills and continue to do this for a living.

Once you\u2019ve started with something, it\u2019s easier to know where you\u2019re going and this is especially true with weight loss. Here are our top eleven weight loss strategies that can help you start your weight loss journey. 1. Cut Out Fizzy Drinks Seriously \u2013 this is one of the easiest ways to start dropping off the pounds. Whilst each individual bottle might not contain that many calories, the tendency to drink it in large quantities adds up. Try swapping out fizzy drinks for just plain water \u2013 and if you simply must have something more, swap to something like a fresh fruit smoothie. Avoiding the calories gained through fizzy drinks \u2013 even the diet version \u2013 can be a nice simple start, and a good foundation to build on. After all, it\u2019s much easier to swap out fizzy drinks than change your whole diet, and it\u2019s much harder to find yourself snacking guiltily on them! 2. Have 5 Small Meals a Day This may seem counter-intuitive, but it makes sense when you think about it. On a standard three meals a day diet, you may find yourself getting hungry in-between meal times, and that\u2019s when the snacking starts. No matter how healthy your main meals, snacking is one of the quickest ways to pile on the pounds. Instead of having three large meals a day, try swapping to five small ones. This should reduce your hunger, helping you to have more control over what you eat and avoiding filling up on snacks! 3. Eat Breakfast As part of the above, try to make sure you eat breakfast. It\u2019s for exactly the same reasons \u2013 while you may think eating more will make you gain weight, it won\u2019t if you\u2019re in control. Instead, eating breakfast means you can avoid snacking in the morning and it can help you keep the pounds off! 4. Swap Coffee/Tea for Green Tea Coffee and tea aren\u2019t particularly big in the weight gain category, but they are an easy thing to swap out. For that reason, we suggest swapping them out for green tea, which has links to weight loss and helps keep you healthy due to the sheer amount of antioxidants in it. It may not help you lose weight by itself, but as a first step it\u2019s good practice for swapping out parts of your daily routine and it\u2019s got a useful support effect to any other changes you might make. You could also take green tea supplements if you preferred. 5. Make Use of Supplements One of the hardest parts of exercising is feeling too tired to even start. If you have this problem, have a look at your diet and what you might be missing. Many people don\u2019t get enough vitamin C, D and E, and it may be worth adding supplements of these to see if it perks you up. Another possibility is a lack of iron, but in this case you should check with a doctor before taking supplements just in case. Not only will taking vitamin C, D and E supplements help you feel more alert and up for exercise, but it\u2019ll also keep your skin clear and healthy and help your body fix any damage exercising might do. 6. Find Some Friends Everything is easier with friends, and losing weight is no different. Having people to talk to who\u2019ll understand the problems you\u2019ve encountered, and to give their own tips, is great. Whether it\u2019s work colleagues, a support group like weight-watchers, or just a group at the local gym, getting some weight loss friends is a great first step. 7. Keep a Food Diary Keep a food diary for a few weeks before starting your diet, and use it to work out your weak points. This strategy of targeting particular issues rather than just reducing intake generally means you\u2019re more likely to success as you\u2019ll have clear goals. Plus if you keep up a food diary once you\u2019ve started you can keep an eye on where you struggle and where you do best! 8. Accept Mistakes One of the most common thing new starters to weight loss do is to make a mistake, panic, give up and binge eat. Come to terms in advance with the idea there will be bad days, and try not to feel guilty for it. It\u2019s okay to have an off day once in a while, so long as you get back up and try again the day after. Learning that mistakes are okay and not to give up is vital. 9. Hide Your Scales Checking the scales everyday can be off-putting and make you feel like you\u2019re barely attaining anything. Get a trusted friend to hide your scales from you and only check them on a set schedule \u2013 every two weeks perhaps. This will help prevent you getting hung up on numbers and instead focus on how your body feels and looks. Remember: if you\u2019re doing exercise, muscle is denser than fat, so numbers aren\u2019t everything. 10. Learn to Cook Some Key Meals Pick out three key, healthy meals that you can easily cook and spend time perfecting them. Cooking your own meals means you\u2019ll have more control over what\u2019s in them, and it can also help you get used to proportions. Definitely worth spending time on! 11. Decide One Exercise Per Day Starting to exercise is hard, so pick on key exercise and try to do it for ten minutes every day. Whether this is standing push-ups, squats or even just a quick jog, dedicating ten minutes to a single exercise everyday is a great way to get going, and you\u2019ll soon find your motivation for doing more increases!", "One does not simply... assume. Actor Sean Bean has been dying over and over again for 20 years. He\u2019s been dropped from a satellite dish in Goldeneye, shot through the neck with a grappling hook in The Island, peppered with arrows in The Lord of the Rings, and decapitated in Game of Thrones. But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it\u2019s time to put the many demises into perspective. Start looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. A long enough career can rack up the kills. For example, Robert de Niro has died on screen 19 times. Other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio have died 9 times. So where does Sean Bean fall along this list? I crafted the following chart to find out: Click to enlarge!* It looks like the \"walking spoiler\" meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them \u2014 almost a third of his films. However, even though Bean has perfected his \"I\u2019m dying\" face, he still hasn\u2019t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies. But the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt. With over 120 movies, Hurt\u2019s death percentage is similar to Bean\u2019s \u2014 around 30% \u2014 but just seeing the list of Hurt\u2019s 43* deaths is impressive. He has died in The Wild and the Willing, Sinful Davey, A Man for All Seasons, 10 Rillington Place, The Ghoul East of Elephant Rock, Spectre, Alien, The Elephant Man, Heaven\u2019s Gate, The Osterman Weekend, The Hit, After Darkness, The Black Cauldron, Jake Speed, Spaceballs, Aria, Deadline, Little Sweetheart, Scandal, L\u2019Oeil qui ment, Monolith, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Contact, The Climb, All the Little Animals, You\u2019re Dead, Lost Souls, Hellboy, Pride, Tabloid, The Proposition, V for Vendetta, Outlander, Boxes, An Englishman in New York, Ultramarines, Whistle and I\u2019ll Come To You, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Only Lovers Left Alive, Snowpiercer, Hercules, and finally the TV miniseries I, Claudius. Maybe it should be #DontKillJohnHurt. So is Sean Bean a walking spoiler alert? For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park\u2018s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.) Of course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt). In the years to come, we could see Boromir bite the dust enough to become the undisputed duke of the death scene. Kyle Hill is the Science Editor of Nerdist Industries.

The job description was as amorphous as the title suggests. Nash worked out a bit with Klay Thompson. He sent texts to Steph Curry. A few days every month he flew from his home in Los Angeles to Oakland. Occasionally he addressed the team, walking through actions and demonstrating ball screens. But Nash, who retired only a year ago, was not looking for a full-time gig. He is a father of three, the general manager of the Canadian national team and a promising movie producer. In 2014, when Nash was still a Laker, he agreed to film conversations with other luminaries for a Vice Sports series called \"Back & Forth.\" In the most notable video, Nash sits on a black leather sofa, wearing a T-shirt and shorts. Next to him, appearing equally casual, is another former MVP: Kevin Durant. With Nash steering the dialogue, they reflect in hushed tones on their roots, motivations and methods. Durant tells Nash that he used to create imaginary basketball games as a boy, using Hot Wheels as players, pennies as balls and tables as courts. They laugh. They connect. The story of Durant\u2019s departure from Oklahoma City and arrival in Golden State, a move that rocked a league and spawned a superpower, features two iconic point guards. The Warriors believe that Durant, loyal to Russell Westbrook on a personal level, was weary of his ball-dominant approach. Curry presented a free-flowing alternative. But several Golden State coaches and executives also acknowledge the everlasting assist of yet another legendary floor general. \"Without Steve Nash,\" one says, \"I\u2019m not sure if we get Kevin Durant.\" Representatives from six teams passed through the gates of the Hamptons mansion where Durant spent the July 4th weekend. The Warriors presentation wasn\u2019t necessarily more memorable than the others. \"We heard the Clippers \u2018blew him away,\u2019\" says Golden State general manager Bob Myers. \"We didn\u2019t blow him away.\" Durant was most struck by the body language of the four players in the room\u2014Curry, Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala\u2014their effortless conversation and easy laughter. He remarked that they looked as if they were holding hands, even though they were not actually touching. Durant had heard all the breathless accounts of the Dubs\u2019 renowned esprit de corps. He wondered whether their kinship was real, and if it was, whether there was space for another in that cocoon. Those were the questions that nagged at him after the gang left. \u2022 Kevin Durant to the Warriors might be NBA's most fascinating move ever The Warriors did not lure Durant at the meeting, but in the 48 hours that followed. They are a collaborative organization\u2014remember Nick U\u2019Ren, the lower-level staffer who suggested the lineup change that helped capture the 2015 championship; and Chris DeMarco, the player development coach who recommended switching sides of the court in Game 6 of this year\u2019s Western Conference finals\u2014so it should come as no surprise that free agency was also a group effort with contributions from unlikely sources. Warriors\u2019 advisor Jerry West made headlines with a phone call, but Durant shared more fundamental concerns about chemistry and fit in conversations with Nash. \"Steve knows us\u2014our culture and our guys\u2014so well,\" says Golden State assistant coach Bruce Fraser, who was with Nash in Phoenix, as were several other Warriors staffers. \"He doesn\u2019t sell anybody on anything. He\u2019s just a great sounding board.\" Fraser was also crucial, because he is close to Nash and spoke with him throughout the process. The Warriors were therefore able to understand Durant\u2019s concerns and address them. Even though Myers did not call or text Durant directly, he deployed others, including head coach Steve Kerr. \"It\u2019s orchestrating from a distance,\" Myers says. \"\u2018Steve, ask if he has any questions. Steph, give him a call so he\u2019s more comfortable. Andre, he might want to hear from you.\u2019 I encouraged all of them. I\u2019m sure other teams did the same thing. But we wanted to feel like, if he said no, it wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t show him who we were.\" \u2022\u200b Open Floor Podcast: Debating Kevin Durant's decision to join the Warriors Your browser does not support iframes. Executives who saw Durant over the weekend, in the mansion off the beach, say he looked drained. He was sitting through as many as six hours of meetings per day, while simultaneously hearing from the Warriors, whose pitch never really ended. Iguodala told Durant he\u2019d have the time of his life in Golden State. Curry insisted he\u2019d be embraced immediately. The Warriors\u2019 incumbent star swore he didn\u2019t care about billboards or shoe sales. He just wanted banners. Durant, already seduced by the Dubs\u2019 rollicking offensive system, was sold. When nine Thunder officials visited Durant on Sunday afternoon, hoping for the last word, they realized they were too late. Durant woke up July 4 at 7 a.m. with his decision made. Informing Oklahoma City general manager Sam Presti, Durant said, was the hardest thing he\u2019s ever done. Calling Myers was even a struggle. \"I just want to say you guys are a great first-class organization,\" he told the Warriors GM. \"It was great getting to know you....but.\" Myers was expecting the qualifier. He had prepared a concession speech, thanking Durant for his consideration, wishing him well in Oklahoma City. \"But I just want to tell you I\u2019m coming to the Warriors,\" Durant continued. He wasn\u2019t purposefully messing with Myers. He was rattled and fried. When word of his announcement reached Kerr, on vacation in Hawaii, the sun wasn\u2019t up yet over the islands. \"We got him! We got him!\" hollered Kerr\u2019s wife, Margot, turning over in bed and waking him with jabs to the leg. There was euphoria in Golden State and agony in Oklahoma City, same as six weeks before, in the wake of the West finals. But the pain was more acute this time and will take longer to subside. Before every game last season, Thunder head coach Billy Donovan slipped into Durant\u2019s locker a hand-written note. Sometimes it was about leadership. Sometimes it was about defense. Sometimes it was just about the upcoming matchup. It was a simple gesture, one of many, underlining OKC\u2019s dedication to Durant. Yes, Westbrook pounds the ball more than Curry, but Westbrook is still one of the three best point guards alive. Yes, Golden State\u2019s attack is more fluid than Oklahoma City\u2019s, but the Thunder still put up the second highest offensive rating of any team in the past five years. If they cannot retain a marquee free agent, after coming up five minutes short of the Finals, what small market can? \u2022 Heartbreak in Oklahoma City: KD says goodbye to city he helped shape The NBA will have to answer that question, same as in 2010, when the Heat assembled their Big Three and prompted a lockout the following year. The Thunder, meanwhile, must gauge whether they can realistically re-sign Westbrook next summer or if they have to trade him. They can\u2019t lose another superstar for squat. And the Warriors, the lone winners in all this, get to slide the league\u2019s most dynamic scorer next to the two most feared shooters. In the Hamptons, Kerr called up about 15 Warriors plays on his laptop and projected them onto a big-screen TV, showing Durant how he could contribute. \"I\u2019ve got some bad habits,\" KD said. \"That\u2019s okay,\" Kerr replied. \"I\u2019ll yell at you.\" Westbrook wasn\u2019t the only iso-heavy star in Oklahoma City; Durant also liked to hold the ball. But the Warriors are enamored with the potential of his playmaking ability. They envision running offense through him at the elbow and in the post, where he can kick to shooters and cutters if the defense collapses, or rise and fire if it doesn\u2019t. With Curry and Thompson spreading the court, Durant will enjoy massive swaths of space, and he may never see a double team again. \"It should be seamless,\" Kerr said. The Warriors don\u2019t have a rim-protecting center, or many qualified reserves, having discarded a chunk of their rotation to make room for Durant. But those are Dom Perignon problems. The Big Four, plus a stiff in marketing, could probably win 50. The first day, though, was not easy. At his introductory press conference, Durant sat stiffly atop the dais, bracing for the inevitable queries about shortcuts to titles. When Kerr suggested he might bring his shiny new acquisition off the bench, everybody laughed except Durant, causing the coach to clarify. \"I\u2019m joking,\" he said. Eventually, Durant warmed up. \"We live in this superhero comic book world,\" he said, \"where you\u2019re either a villain or you\u2019re a superhero...I trusted my gut. I trusted my instincts. It\u2019s the unpopular decision. But I can live with it.\" From the Philippines, where Canada participated in an Olympic qualifying tournament, Nash downplayed his friend\u2019s quest for NBA gold. \"I think it was as much a personal move for his happiness and development as it was to win,\" Nash told reporters. Late Thursday, after a week of advice, introspection and upheaval, Durant went looking for a little of the joy the Warriors talk so much about. There was only one place to go. He wrapped up his press conference and walked onto the practice court. Far from the meetings and the mansion, he grabbed a ball and took a shot.", "Like 40 Share On a very rainy day when it was pouring, Kathryn Van Beek was rushing home in a rain-soaked pathway in Auckland, New Zealand.

Still, the show's costume designer Lyn Paolo corroborates Kerry's story for People: \"She came in her husband [Nnamdi Asomugha]'s giant football player sweatshirt and said 'Look, I'm the best dressed!' It was pretty funny.\" A fashionista who knows how to avoid vanity and to have fun with clothes? We didn't think it possible, but we just found yet another reason to love Kerry Washington. As if you needed more inspiration, Washington explained her philosophy to Fashionista: \"My goal has never been to wind up on anybody's list and it's just to have a good time and make sure that I'm happy when I'm on the red carpet, so that's going to continue to be my goal, and I'm glad people like it.\" And if that's not what fashion is about, we don't know what is.

So what's the secret to its unlikely success? For a football-obsessed nation like Nigeria, talent can be found in every corner, but there's definitely something special about Ajegunle, or AJ City, as it's known by locals. Since the early 1990s, Ajegunle has been churning out football talent. Famous names such as Taribo West, Odion Ighalo, Brown Ideye, Samson Siasia, Obafemi Martins, Taribo West and Jonathan Akpoborie all started here. Life is not easy for many of the residents of this sprawling ghetto. They have to contend with high crime rates, as well the absence of running water, grid-powered electricity or healthcare. So what are the factors that contribute to Ajegunley's footballing pedigree? Diversity, for one. \"It's a community with so many people from different ethnicities,\" says Bennedict Ehenemba, a football scout for German clubs who is a native of Ajegunle. \"Ajegunle accommodates the Yorubas, the Igbos, the Hausas, the Itsekiris and all the other tribes in Nigeria. \"It's a raw talent hub of Nigeria,\" he tells me. Many success stories can be traced back to two local institutions - St Mary's Catholic Church and the Navy Barracks Camp. They remain safe places for many young people to play the game. Other open spaces are often claimed by so-called \"Area Boys\", unruly gangs who often demand a fee for people to play there. Super Eagles striker Jonathan Akpoborie, who made his name in Germany's Bundesliga in the 1990s, also honed his skills here. \"This is actually the home of football in Nigeria,\" Akpoborie tells me, adding that the game is seen by many youngsters as a route to a better life. \"I don't want to downgrade the area by attributing the success of footballers to poverty but there's just nothing to do for the kids. \"They spend most of their time here playing football and in so doing they develop themselves and naturally become gifted footballers. \"In one national team there's always one player who originated from Ajegunle. \"It's exactly how I started - the grown-ups play first, we watch them play, then eventually we get in the field. They were inspirational to us.\" The slum also has an established system of grassroots football, which encourages talented youngsters to play competitive football for local clubs at an early age. This often gives them an edge over players at competing academies across the country. Alfred Emuejeraye, who plies his trade in the Swiss lower leagues, also grew up in Ajegunle. He believes the secret of the slum lies in its deep love of the game. \"The people here, the community are passionate about football, passionate about everything and are driven to succeed in whatever they do from musicians to taxi drivers... It's an all-round community,\" he tells me. Odion Ighalo - formerly of Watford FC in the English Premier League but now playing for Chinese Super League outfit Changchun Yatai FC - is another Ajegunle native. Now he lives in some of the world's biggest cities, but still remembers Ajegunle fondly. \"It was very tough growing up there. It's not like in Europe where you have everything provided. \"You have to look for money to buy football shoes, jerseys, transport and even water for to drink after training. If you can't afford the transport then you stay - and those who stay are great players,\" says Ighalo. Bolarinwa Olajide is a sports reporter with Lagos-based radio station Wazobia. He saw many of these players emerge from Ajegunle over the years. \"We see the hopeless, those who know they have a talent but they can't exhibit it anywhere. They can't afford fees to join a football academy, so they go to Ajegunle because they know scouts come to watch them play, and it's a chance to show what they can do as footballers,\" he tells me. Leicester City and Nigeria midfielder Wilfred Ndidi did not grow up in Ajegunle but played against boys from the slum during his time at an academy in Lagos. He believes Ajegunle has produced good football players because the boys there \"work hard, the lifestyle is difficult so they try to work very hard and come out with their best.\" To keep the Ajegunle legacy going, some of the footballers are already giving back to the community with projects to nurture future talent. Akpoborie is helping to identify future football talent, while Ighalo is building an orphanage in the heart of the slum.

Academy Awards presentation.", "July 1, 2016 | Nick Bernabe (ANTIWAR) Thirteen years of wars in the Middle East, since the illegal and criminal invasion of Iraq by the United States and Britain in 2003, have killed way over a million people; destroyed Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya, and created millions of refugees. The terrorist attacks by Daesh (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East have strengthened xenophobia, Islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners. Daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of Iraq that led to the emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in Libya and Syria. Can things get any worse? Not only can they, we should expect new wars in the Middle East if Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president is elected next November. Even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives\u2019 enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the Middle East will be. Hillary Clinton is a hawk and warmonger. People often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in Iraq and her enthusiasm for it. After all, it was during her husband\u2019s presidency that toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein became the official policy of the United States. But, her track record of starting and supporting wars, and siding with despots is much deeper than Iraq. She supported the coup in Honduras in 2009 and in Ukraine in 2014; was the leading advocate of the U.S. and NATO intervention in Libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all types of terrorist groups; laughed shamelessly at the news of Muammar Ghaddafi\u2019s murder; supported extra-judicial assassinations by drones; backed escalation of the war in Afghanistan ordered by President Obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward Russia. And as Secretary of State she supported massive sale of advanced US weapons to Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Persian Gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack Yemen. The only \"accomplishments\" that she is still lacking are starting a war with Iran and invading Syria. If she is elected president, she may get to add both to her \"impeccable\" track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark World War III, if it has not already begun as a result of US policy toward the Middle East. Clinton considers Syria and Iran closely linked. In fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in Syria has a lot to do with Iran, its strategic alliance with Syria, its use of Syrian territory to help the Lebanese Hezbollah, and more generally what the Sunni Arab regimes of the region consider as the \"Shiite crescent\" \u2013 the alliance between the Shiites in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon. So, before the war began in Syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria as a way of separating the latter from Iran. But, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to Israel\u2019s intransigence. Thus, to her destroying Syria in order to topple Bashar al-Assad became the pathway for attacking Iran, which she views as necessary for Israel\u2019s sake, as the Clintons have deep connections to Israel and its lobby in the United States Her advocacy of direct US intervention in Syria began carefully. One of her top aides, Ann-Marie Slaughter who was director of policy planning at the State Department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the New York Times in February 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in Syria. Clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called \"friends of Syria\" group, consisting of several Western nations and the very Arab regimes that despise Iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in Syria, namely, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, as well as Turkey. The group is similar to the Contact Group on Libya, also known as \"friends of Libya,\" which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in Libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to. But, Hillary Clinton has gone even further. In an interview with the CNN she claimed Syria and Iran (as well as Russia) helped creating the Daesh, saying, \"ISIS was primarily the result of the vacuum in Syria caused by Assad first and foremost. Aided and abetted by Iran and Russia.\" Despite Clinton\u2019s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with Iran, P5+1 and Iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in July 2015 after Iran made many significant concessions. After the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between Iran and the United States would slowly develop. At the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the President and his Vice President Joe Biden, to even the editors of the New York Times that Saudi Arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East. They are also raping the poor nation of Yemen with US logistic and military support. Yet, Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward Iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure. This is of course neither new nor surprising. Along with the neocons, the Clintons have always been Iran\u2019s number one enemy in the US political establishment. The cliche\u0301 in the West is that it is Iran that does not want improved relations with the West. That is not true, at least not when Iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power. Three times over the past 20 years the Iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the United States, and in each case the Clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it. In May 1995 former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the US by awarding the American oil company Conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf, although a European oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract. But, instead of responding in kind, Bill Clinton imposed total trade embargo on Iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed \"dual containment\" policy according to which both Iran and Iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box. Then, in 1998 former reformist President proposed \"dialogue among civilizations\" as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations. Not only had Khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the Majles[Iranian parliament] in February 2000. But, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward Iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, Bill Clinton announced that Iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the United States, as if that would impress any Iranian. The Clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with Iran, but Khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against Iran would first be lifted, which were not. After Hillary Clinton was elected a Senator from New York in 2000, she supported every resolution by Congress imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran. All such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the United Nations Security Council. As Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of Western nations that imposed \"the toughest sanctions\" in history on Iran. The sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary Iranians. Now that she is running for President again, Clinton\u2019s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as Secretary of State, Hard Choices. In an interview with ABC in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton was running for President, she was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, \"I want the Iranians to know that if I\u2019m the president, we will attack Iran. In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel we would be able to totally obliterate them\" (emphasis mine). Iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and Clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if Iran attacked Israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless Israel attacks first), she would defend Israel. Her threat to obliterate Iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: Attacking Iran with nuclear weapons. Even though Clinton\u2019s most important \"accomplishment\" as Secretary of State, namely, attacking Libya under the guise of \"humanitarian intervention,\" which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the BBC and Voice of America in October 2011 she claimed that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. While the leaders of Iran\u2019s Green Movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after Iran\u2019s fraudulent presidential elections of June 2009, rejected any US help, Clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the US was prepared to help them the way it helped Libyan rebels. In other words, the US would have tried regime change in Iran. Although Hillary Clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with Iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles Iran. In a speech at the Brookings Institution last September, Clinton declared, \"I don\u2019t see Iran as our partner in implementing this agreement. I believe Iran is the subject of the agreement\" (emphasis mine), as if Iran is a banana republic that is subject to US will. In an article in TheJewish Journal she threatened Iran again, \"We have to send Iran an unequivocal message. There can be no doubt in Tehran that if Iran\u2019s leaders violate their commitments not to seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons, the United States will stop them. They will test our resolve with actions like their provocative ballistic missile test, for which we should impose new sanctions designations. They need to understand that America will act decisively if Iran violates the nuclear agreement, including taking military action if necessary.\" (emphasis added). Clinton\u2019s rhetoric regarding Iran, even after the nuclear accord, only creates trouble for the administration of President Hassan Rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with Tehran\u2019s hardliners. By taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relations with Iran, Hillary Clinton is a strong ally of Iranian hardliners who also do not want any rapprochement with the United States. In addition to constantly demonizing Iran, Hillary Clinton is always looking for ways of imposing new economic sanctions on Iran to carry favor with the pro-Israel lobby and its rich donors. For example, it is well known that Iranian hardliners were, and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with P5+1, just as the neocons and the extreme right in the United States opposed it and still do. So, the Iranian hardliners have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord, and one way of doing so, in addition to creating other problems for the Rouhani administration, has been testing ballistic missiles. The missiles are purely defensive weapons meant to deter Israel and the tests, unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the United States claims, do not violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 that was issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it. Despite these glaring facts, after the missile tests, Mrs. Clinton quickly called for new sanctions against Iran. During the primary season the Clinton campaign slammed Senator Sanders\u2019 suggestion that the US and Iran should have closer relations. Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton\u2019s senior policy adviser, said on January 21, \"This proposal [by Sanders] to more aggressively normalize relations and to move to warm relations with Iran not only breaks with President Obama\u2019s policy, it breaks with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that\u2019s been working for the United States.\" This is not surprising. Hardliners everywhere are allies of each other and feed one another, and Clinton and Tehran\u2019s hardliners are no exception. Not only does Hillary Clinton not want improved relations with Iran, she has been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and, thus, she constantly demonizes Iran. But, in addition to demonizing Iran, she also lies about that nation brazenly. For example, similar to Benjamin Netanyahu she always refers collectively to Iran, Daesh and the Palestinian group Hamas, as if they are allies. Iran has been fighting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq. Iran cut off its financial aid to Hamas after that organization refused to back Bashar al-Assad in Syria. There is absolutely no relation between Hamas and Daesh. In fact, many senior Israeli officers have made it clear that they prefer Hamas to run Gaza, because the alternative would be either Daesh or one of the terrorist groups allied with it, Why is Mrs. Clinton so anti-Iran? I can think of at least two reasons. One is that Hillary Clinton has never given up her imperial ambitions to reshape the Middle East, because she believes in American \"exceptionalism\" and always speaks about \"American global leadership,\" which only means world dominance. She sees Iran as an impediment to her ambitions for the Middle East. Why does she want to reshape the Middle East and possibly change the borders? This brings us to the second reason for her being anti-Iran. Clinton is an Israel \"firster.\" Anything that she wants for the Middle East is intended for making the region as \"safe\" for Israel as possible. Clinton is not bothered by the fact that Israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambitions. To see this, all one has to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of AIPAC in March. When asked during her first Democratic presidential debate last October \"which enemy are you most proud of,\" Hillary Clinton included \"the Iranians\" among them. This was truly disturbing. Was she talking about 80 million Iranians? If she meant the Iranian government, why did she not say so? Why did she not make it clear that she meant, for example, Tehran\u2019s hardliners? Apparently, Hillary Clinton considers all Iranians as the enemy, which is truly disturbing. Those who argue that we should vote for Clinton as the lesser of two evils in the upcoming presidential elections are truly misguided. Yes, for decades if not longer elections in the United State have been reduced to choosing between bad and worse. But, not this time. Hillary Clinton is simply as terrible as Donald Trump, if not worse. Expect new catastrophic wars in the Middle East, especially one with Iran, if she is elected.

Yes, there\u2019s the augmented reality mode, and you can leave that AR feature on to put Poke\u0301mon on a backdrop of whatever\u2019s in front of you. Problem is, you\u2019re then focusing on catching the Poke\u0301mon instead of the background of reality. The little suckers move around in AR mode, too! It\u2019s one thing to walk around your apartment trying to catch a particularly jump-happy Poke\u0301mon. It\u2019s much worse to do so while also trying to drive. You can\u2019t easily spin around in the driver\u2019s seat if a Poke\u0301mon darts sideways, and it takes an absurd amount of your attention to follow them around anyway. So, keep it in park if you\u2019re going to do anything in the game. You can enjoy the comfortable seats, luxurious cupholders and life-sustaining air conditioning of your car\u2019s interior, but don\u2019t play the game itself unless your car is safely parked, and out of the way of other traffic. Simply put: \"P\" means \"play.\" Or, if you have a manual transmission, don\u2019t even think about playing until you\u2019ve yanked the parking brake. Parked to figure out my next move. Rule No. 2: Scope Out Your Next Poke\u0301stop Before Going There The great thing about the Poke\u0301mon Go interface is that it gives you a map. You can tap on further away gyms and Poke\u0301stops to see where they are before they\u2019re in range, and thus, you can figure out where you\u2019d like to go next without the app distracting you from the task of driving. Find a few points of interest, write them down, or put them in your car\u2019s navigation unit. Then drive there! Driving is great. When you park, do so in a safe and legal location. Be sure to follow all applicable traffic and parking laws as you normally would. Rule No. 3: Leave Your Phone On, But On Silent And Hidden One big downside to the game is that it has to be on and running to work, or to log those brief moments where you\u2019re traveling at low speeds (more on this later). This will drain your battery life fast, according to anyone who\u2019s ever played the game for more than 30 minutes. Fortunately, most cars now come with power outlets, so your car is bizarrely well-suited for hunting Poke\u0301mon. Once you have your next Poke\u0301stop determined, plug your phone in, throw it on silent, and forget about it until your next stop. Then you\u2019ll pull up with a fully recharged phone with more than enough battery life to stuff your next gym full of Magikarp. http://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-pla... How to leave your phone hidden while charging, as illustrated in a Porsche 918 Spyder. If you\u2019re the kind of person who is tempted by phone sounds, hide it in a cubbyhole. Out of sight, out of mind. If you know you\u2019ll still somehow hear it vibrate, turn off that function as well. If you really have no self-control, stick your phone in the trunk. I will say that my fear of becoming That Guy who mowed down an entire median full of ornamental shrubberies while playing Poke\u0301mon Go has made me a less distracted driver. With the game on, gone is my temptation to glance down at text messages at stop lights. I simply don\u2019t want to interrupt the game or get caught using it behind the wheel. One of many landmarks you\u2019ll find as Poke\u0301stops in the game. Rule No. 4: Get Out And Walk Around Anyway I\u2019m always looking for shortcuts. So, naturally, the idea of tossing my phone in the trunk to run a few errands\u2014or laps on a race track\u2014to hatch an egg sounded like a solid plan. Nope. The app was one step ahead of that idea. After my roughly 48-kilometer drive to test this idea barely netted any km towards egg hatching, I wondered what was up. Turns out, there\u2019s a speed limit on what the game will log in terms of distance traveled. While I couldn\u2019t find the limit published on any official channels, one unofficial source on Quora claimed the app is limited to 20 kph\u2014which sounds about right. Because you have to drive safely, we don\u2019t recommend puttering around at speeds slower than 20 kph on public roads. That\u2019s only about 12 mph for those of us not fully dedicated to the metric system. 12! You would blow the fuse in your horn if you got stuck behind some jamoke doing 12 mph on a public road. It\u2019s still worth having the app on and hidden in your car as it will still log that brief bit of travel under 12 mph, but don\u2019t expect it to hatch eggs much faster. There are better ways to cheat this, after all, some of which even involve the use of remote-control cars. If you\u2019re playing around cars, make sure they\u2019re going to stay parked for a while. Inside Petrol Lounge, Austin. Rather, do what the game wants you to do: get out and explore. See your city\u2019s landmarks. If you have an egg to hatch, drive to a park that has a few stops in it. Pick Poke\u0301stops that coincide with other errands you have to do. My usual coffee shop, for example, is next door to a gym. That\u2019s convenient! I\u2019m out of my car anyway and it\u2019s a place I don\u2019t mind hanging out for a little while. Once you\u2019re at a stop and have caught all the new Poke\u0301mon you can, you can start the process all over again: pick a new Poke\u0301stop or gym to drive to based on the options available, toss your silent phone on a charger out of reach, and have at it.", "Juggling high-pressured jobs with starting families and maintaining social lives is leaving our generation highly anxious. So what if there was a simple three-minute solution for clearing your mind and erasing your worries instantly? According to Emmy-Lou Knowles, Mediation Coach and Intuitive Healer at www.youremmylou.com, there is - and anyone can master it.   Speaking to FEMAIL, she explained: 'When worry kicks off and stress kicks in, you need to make space. You don\u2019t need incense, candles or to be sat legs crossed on the floor \u2013 let\u2019s be realistic.'

The Afghan defense ministry confirmed on Sunday that Captain Niloofar Rahmani, 25, had sought asylum after the Wall Street Journal quoted her as saying that she feared her life would be in danger if she returned home. A recipient of the U.S. State Department's \"Women of Courage\" award in 2015, Capt. Rahmani had been a symbol of efforts to improve the situation of women in her country, more than a decade after the fall of the Taliban regime. Mohammad Radmanish, a defense ministry spokesman, said the government hoped that her request would be denied by U.S. authorities who have spent billions trying to build up Afghan security forces. \"When an officer complains of insecurity and is afraid of security threats, then what should ordinary people do?\" he said. \"She has made an excuse for herself, but we have hundreds of educated women and female civil right activists who work and it is safe for them.\" Capt. Rahmani, who graduated from flight school in 2012 and qualified to fly C-208 military cargo aircraft, had been in the United States on a training course and had been due to return home on Saturday. In a conservative country notorious for the restrictions placed on women, Rahmani's story stood out as a rare example of a woman breaking through in areas normally reserved for men. Her success came at a price, however. The citation for the \"Women of Courage\" award said she and her family had received direct threats not just from the Taliban but also from some relatives, forcing her family to move house several times. However, there was little sympathy on Afghanistan's active social media networks, which were replete with comments criticizing Rahmani, accusing her of wasting government money spent on expensive training and avoiding her responsibilities. \"Niloofar Rahmani took a million dollars from the pockets of the people of Afghanistan to pay human traffickers to get to America to seek asylum,\" one Facebook user wrote in comments typical of others. Dozens of Afghan troops receiving training in the United States have gone missing over the past two years, and at least one has been detained while trying to cross the border to Canada.", "An analysis of giant panda poop has revealed that when the bears switch to a leafy, less fibrous diet, they slough off the lining of their gastrointestinal tract. It then passes through their digestive system and comes out as a gooey mass. The findings, published in Frontiers in Microbiology this month, may help explain why these endangered animals are struggling to reproduce. Recent work revealed that the digestive systems of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) resemble that of carnivores and omnivorous bears \u2013 even though their transition to a vegetarian diet happened some 2 million years ago. Their gut and gut microbes are built for breaking down meat and small amounts of plant matter, yet pandas eat up to a third of their body weight in bamboo every day. A team led by Garret Suen from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ashli Brown of Mississippi State studied two giant pandas living at the Memphis Zoological Society in Tennessee: a female named YaYa and a male named LeLe (pictured above). The team observed the pandas\u2019 bamboo consumption behavior, and they collected fresh feces (pictured to the right) as well as samples of mucous excretion. Pandas undergo dramatic seasonal shifts in diet: Most of the time, they eat bamboo stalks, but in August and September, they shift to leaves. Shortly after this summertime shift from woody stalks to less fibrous leaves, the pandas experience episodes of gastrointestinal tract distress, with symptoms ranging from abdominal pain to the excretion of mucous stools containing gelatinous pellets called mucoids. And the pandas stop eating. After sequencing DNA extracted from stool samples, the team found that microbial diversity is lower in samples collected immediately before mucoid episodes than in the mucoids. Additionally, mucoids contain microbes that are typically found in the gut lining. Together, these findings suggest that mucoids are the expulsion of the internal mucus lining driven by changes in diet. \"What we think might be happening is that their diet is causing a strong internal reaction, leading to an inflammatory response,\" Suen explained in a statement. \"Pandas are basically shedding their gastrointestinal lining to allow for the replacement of those microbes. It\u2019s kind of like resetting the microbiome.\" The researchers aren\u2019t sure why pandas experience this resetting, and furthermore, this summer shift in food \u2013 and the sickness that follows \u2013 coincides with the beginning of panda pregnancies. Mucoids are more prevalent following breeding season, and the reduction in nutrition may affect gestation, lactation, and cub development.

Candace Williams", "Bonds fan rejoice: Daniel Craig to return as 007 Thursday, 4 Dec 2014 | 12:00 AM ET | 00:54 The twenty-fourth James Bond film is called \"Spectre\" with Oscar-winning new casting Christoph Waltz likely to be the villain, and Italian actress Monica Belluci the latest Bond girl. Daniel Craig will return as fictional British spy James Bond, also known as 007, for the latest instalment which is set to begin filming on Monday, director Sam Mendes announced at an event at London's Pinewood Studios on Thursday. Details of the film's plot were scant but Mendes gave a small hint of the story to fans of the Ian Fleming novels. Read MoreJames Bond submarine car fails to wow at auction \"The title of the twenty fourth Bond movie is Spectre. Those of you who have some knowledge of the Bond franchise and legend of Bond will probably have some idea what that refers to, but I couldn't possibly comment,\" Mendes said. SPECTRE is a global terrorism organization in Fleming's novels. The organization's name stands for: Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion, and it was headed by evil genius Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who famously appears stroking a white cat in earlier films in the Bond franchise.", "Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates have all attributed their success to one factor. In fact, this one trait is behind the success of all people that have performed massively better than the average person. Read on to find out what the trait is and how you can put it into practice in your own life and investing. The most important factor for success According to Alice Schroeder, in 1991 when Bill Gates' dad asked Buffett and Gates what the most important factor for their success was, they both gave the same answer, \"focus.\" Gates' focus was illustrated in Walter Isaacson's new book The Innovators, as well as Gates' fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen: One trait that differentiated the two was focus. Allen's mind would flit between many ideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor. \"Where I was curious to study everything in sight, Bill would focus on one task at a time with total discipline,\" said Allen. \"You could see it when he programmed. He would sit with a marker clenched in his mouth, tapping his feet and rocking; impervious to distraction.\" Steve Jobs was the same way; he was relentlessly focused on attacking problems searching for the best answer. Apple's founding marketing philosophy had three main tenets the second of which is focus: In order to do a good job of those things we decide to do we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities. Focus was key for Buffett as well, Schroeder writes: \"He ruled out paying attention to almost anything but business\u2014art, literature, science, travel, architecture\u2014so that he could focus on his passion.\" Why is this so important? In life and investing, you need to be relentlessly focused on your goals if you want to have better than average results. Differentiation To stick out from the crowd, you need to do something better than everyone else. There's no standard definition of what \"better\" is though. McDonald's does low prices and quick drive through service while Chipotle does massive burritos with a great service culture . They both have been wildly successful as they focus on doing one thing well. What gets companies and people into trouble is when they try and do too much, leading to mediocrity. McDonalds has been suffering lately as its menu has grown to accommodate so many different items that is has gotten unwieldy , leading to a confusing menu and longer wait times. Apple was a disaster with 350 different products before Jobs came back in 1998. He refocused the business around the customer experience, simplifying Apple's focus to just 10 products. Everyone knows the rest of the story. Successful investing Like success in life and business, to be successful in investing, you need focus and time if you want to do better than average. As Warren Buffett has explained, \"Successful Investing takes time, discipline and patience. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\" Just getting to average performance is hard enough. While by definition, the average investor cannot do better than average, the average investor would do nearly 80% better if he or she simply earned the average market return. Most investors would be better off in index funds. The first key part to be successful is to learn the mistakes that hold people back and avoid them. For investors these include being too active , overconfident , loss-averse , taking on debt to invest , and making rash decisions based on daily market movements , among others. The second part is to know what your goals are and have a process where you constantly learn, think independently , and quickly try and figure out when you are wrong . You need to go put in the effort so that you can evaluate a selection of businesses and build a circle of competence , that is a set of businesses and industries that you can understand and can independently evaluate. Only then will you be able to select businesses whose values are misjudged by the market, providing an opportunity for you to profit. To get to that point, Buffett suggests: Read 500 pages like this [annual reports, trade journals, etc.] every day. That's how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it. Most people don't do this. The key is to realize the limits of your knowledge, you can't know and be good at everything. For this reason, most people shouldn't try and invest in stocks to beat the market since they can't put in the time and focus. However, by learning about investing and how to evaluate businesses you build knowledge that will help you understand your job better, your industry better, and everyday life better. As Buffett has said, \"I am a better investor because I am a businessman and I am a better businessman because I am an investor.\" Investing is a lifelong journey, not a sprint. If you are willing to put in the time and focus, a commitment to learning how to invest will pay dividends for the rest of your life.

But she didn\u2019t lock the doors Monday night, which apparently puts you at risk for a bear break-in.

Two deputies with the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2014 a department that has plenty of experience with animal-related calls \u2014 responded Tuesday. The bear had somehow entered and locked itself inside the car, and the deputies couldn\u2019t figure out how, the department said in a statement. \"No windows were broken. The door handles weren\u2019t the kind you lift up. And yet somehow this medium-sized bear managed to open a door, crawl inside and close the door behind him,\" according to the department. \"Deputies could tell by all the moisture on the windows that he\u2019d clearly been inside for a while. \"Given the size of the bear, they also wondered if there was a mama bear nearby.\" The bear does look kind of small, though large enough to inflict some serious auto damage. As one deputy approached the car, the bear clawed at the window. Uhhhhhhhhh, TOO CLOSE! (Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office) \"Yeah, stay away from me, bear,\" the deputy can be heard saying in the video. \"He\u2019s clawing at stuff. I hope he doesn\u2019t hit the latch.\" The deputies eventually decided the safest thing to do would be to pop open the hatch. But the door wouldn\u2019t open with the key fob button, the department said. So one deputy had to manually open the car\u2019s door. As in, be physically close to a Subaru with a distressed bear trapped inside. Another deputy stood nearby with a shotgun \u2014 \"just in case,\" the department said. \"Thankfully once the door was open the bear had no interest in deputies, only in getting back into the wild,\" the sheriff\u2019s office said.

Tossing and turning on your bed, just randomly checking the fridge for late night munchies and scrolling through your social media must be your usual post-midnight activities for sure. If you are wondering how to get uninterrupted sleep, then this will help. We have a list of things which people usually do to get a good sleep. Maybe you can try them out too!  1. Take a long, warm shower with sweet-smelling essential oils.  Fragrances such as lavender or jasmine will help you relax and calm you down. Add a few drops of your favourite essential oils to your bath water and de-stress after a long day at work. You can set up aromatic candles in your bathroom too.  2. Create the perfect ambience before you head over to sleep. Clean your room of the whole day\u2019s mess, dab some perfume and make your bed with some fresh bed sheets and pillow covers. When your surroundings are neat and soothing, you will be able to relax easily and put yourself to sleep sooner. Don\u2019t forget the dim lights! (Fairy lights are always magical.)  3. Let your bed exclusively be for sleeping. Keep your bed as the ONLY-FOR-SLEEPING zone! Whether it is working, eating or catching up some shows on your laptop or phone, do it all away from the bed. Condition your mind to think that the bed is meant strictly for sleeping. So, when you actually come and fall flat on it, your brain will know just what to do next.  4. Read or listen to something soothing.  Pick up your favourite romantic novel and read for a while, or create a playlist with some nice instrumental songs that can put you to sleep. This will not just take your mind off all the tension you had during the day, but will probably help you get some good dreams too! 5. Tell yourself a story.  Be your own storyteller and just create some happy, imaginary tales for yourself. It can be anything that would make you happy and relaxed. You can even pen down your thoughts.  6.

You always have a new day waiting for you, and anything that isn\u2019t super-urgent can always be done the next morning. So, just recite your prayers and zone yourself out of the world, and get into your own dreamland.  Without good sleep, you won't be able to function properly at all the next day. You need to sleep well, and do anything it takes to get your rest! Most of us, anyway have to struggle to get good sleep.  So, we need to keep a check on how good our sleep is.

Hover over the countries below to see which category each falls into. Below the map, we take a closer look at the 10 countries \u2014 or parts of countries \u2014 in which homosexuality is punishable by death. Here are the 10 countries where homosexuality may be punishable by death: Yemen: According to the 1994 penal code, married men can be sentenced to death by stoning for homosexual intercourse. Unmarried men face whipping or one year in prison. Women face up to seven years in prison. Iran : In accordance with sharia law, homosexual intercourse between men can be punished by death, and men can be flogged for lesser acts such as kissing. Women may be flogged. Iraq : The penal code does not expressly prohibit homosexual acts, but people have been killed by militias and sentenced to death by judges citing sharia law. Mauritania : Muslim men engaging in homosexual sex can be stoned to death, according to a 1984 law. Women face prison. Nigeria : Federal law classifies homosexual behavior as a felony punishable by imprisonment, but several states have adopted sharia law and imposed a death penalty for men. A law signed in early January makes it illegal for gay people countrywide to hold a meeting or form clubs. Qatar : Sharia law in Qatar applies only to Muslims, who can be put to death for extramarital sex, regardless of sexual orientation. Saudi Arabia : Under the country\u2019s interpretation of sharia law, a married man engaging in sodomy or any non-Muslim who commits sodomy with a Muslim can be stoned to death. All sex outside of marriage is illegal. Somalia : The penal code stipulates prison, but in some southern regions, Islamic courts have imposed Sharia law and the death penalty. Sudan : Three-time offenders under the sodomy law can be put to death; first and second convictions result in flogging and imprisonment. Southern parts of the country have adopted more lenient laws. United Arab Emirates : Lawyers in the country and other experts disagree on whether federal law prescribes the death penalty for consensual homosexual sex or only for rape. In a recent Amnesty International report, the organization said it was not aware of any death sentences for homosexual acts. All sexual acts outside of marriage are banned.", "After adding a much requested pinch and zoom feature last week, Facebook-owned photo sharing giant Instagram is taking away a popular feature-photo maps. According to technology news site Mashable, Instagram is killing the feature that allowed you to see a map of where a given user's photos were taken (if they designated a location for the photo). You could also zoom in on maps to get a closer view of where photos were taken in a particular city or region. Instagram's base of approximately 500 million users can still see their own personal photo maps, but just no longer access other users' maps. \"Photo Map was not widely used, so we've decided to remove the feature and focus on other priorities,\" the company said in a statement to Mashable.

For example, with Pinch and Zoom, users can use the pinch and zoom gesture on their iPhone screen to zoom on photos and videos in the main feed, on other user\u2019s profiles, and in the explore tab of the app. A few weeks ago, Instagram debuted a new feature called Stories, operating similar to Snapchat\u2019s feature with the same name. Like Snapchat\u2019s Stories, the Instagram version allows users to collect a number of individual photos and videos into a \"story\" that they can share with their followers. The Facebook-owned app also recently launched an events-themed video section, which is comparable to a feature that Snapchat has been offering for some time.

Since 1990, the African country has reduced its child mortality rates by 72 percent. Two years ago, there were 68 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 244 in 1990. While Malawi is still far off from obtaining equitable health outcomes among the rich and the poor, it has outpaced other sub-Saharan African countries by committing more government funds to healthcare, prioritizing maternal care and bringing medical resources to rural areas. For example, Malawi is one of just six countries in the African Union (AU) that has met and surpassed its health-spending target, according to UNAIDS. In 2001, the AU pledged to spend at least 15 percent of total government budget on health. Malawi has committed 18 percent to such spending. Rwanda, which is on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals for child mortality and maternal health, has also surpassed the AU health pledge, according to the Save the Children report. Part of the reason why poor Malawian mothers and their newborns have a better shot at survival than those in nearby regions is because of the increased focus on maternal wellbeing. In the poorest areas of the country, 63 percent of births take place with a skilled attendant present. While advocates have pressed the need to improve that figure, it\u2019s still far better than what many neighboring countries face. In Niger, which has one of the highest child mortality rates, just 8 percent of women in rural areas deliver with an adept birth attendant, according to Women and Health Alliance International. To ensure that kids in Malawi, even ones in the most remote regions, get access to basic medical care, the country\u2019s Ministry of Health supported a program that brings treatment to children who were once inaccessible. Since 2008, more than 3,000 community health workers have delivered medicine and other equipment needed to treat malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and other non-fatal illnesses, to more than 10,400 communities. Despite its successes, Malawi is still plagued with a number of obstacles, which have impeded its progress. A government finance scandal led donors to withdraw their support in 2013. It also struggles with issues, which other countries that have had similar gains also face. Malawi, Bangladesh and Rwanda -- which were all heralded in the report for their child and maternal health progress -- still severely lack quality health services and well-trained health workers. Advocates say resolving that issue is key to curbing preventable deaths. \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that so many children\u2019s chances of survival across the world are purely a matter of whether or not they were lucky enough to be born into an affluent family who can access quality healthcare,\" Carolyn Miles, president and CEO of Save the Children, said in a statement. \"We know that change is possible. We now have a significant window of opportunity to drive this change.\"", "Maybe you, like me, decided at some point in your life that you'd had enough of soft drugs for a while. Whether this was the beginning of a smoke-free existence or just a hopeless case of hubris is irrelevant here; the point is that you stopped smoking weed for a bit. When you did, you probably also experienced a plethora of positive effects: You felt more energetic, found it easier to remember things, and stopped spending $20 a day on cheeseburgers and Doritos. A few days after I quit smoking weed for the first time, I started dreaming again and those dreams seemed more vivid than ever. I realized that as a stoner, I actually hardly ever dreamt at all, and that the few dreams I had weren't half as intense as my dreams these days. What's up with that? I decided to call Dr. Hans Hamburger, neurologist, somnologist (sleep expert), and head of Holland Sleep Research\u2014a specialist research center for sleep disorders in the Netherlands. According to Hamburger, this resurgence of dreams is common among former smokers; weed suppresses your REM sleep. When you put your rolling papers, pipe, or vaporizers away for a while, your REM sleep suddenly gets the free rein it had before you became a superficially sleeping stoner Because I'm not a somnologist myself, I asked what REM sleep exactly is. \"Every night, you go through about four or five sleep cycles,\" Hamburger replied. \"Each cycle takes about ninety minutes, during which you go through different phases. There's superficial sleep, deep sleep, and finally REM sleep. During that REM period, you have most of your dreams. You don't usually remember your dreams if you continue sleeping. The last REM period just before you wake up takes the longest\u2014and you'll only remember the dreams you had in that time if you wake up during it. If you don't wake up during the REM period, you won't remember a thing.\" Does this mean you can't remember anything at all when you're sleeping? The answer seems to be no. \"You only remember the things that happen while you're awake,\" said Hamburger. \"We don't remember the things that happen while we are sleeping, because we're in a lowered state of consciousness. That has something to do with the fact that when you're asleep, you're processing the memories of things that happened during the day and essentially filing them away in your brain.\" Dreams help you sort through the thousands of impressions and images you encounter every day. When you smoke weed regularly, that function is also suppressed. Dr. Hamburger confirms this: \"By smoking weed, you suppress the REM sleep, and with that you also suppress a lot of important functions of that REM sleep. One of those functions is reliving the things you have experienced and coming to terms with them, as it were. Processing all kinds of psychological influences is something you do in REM sleep. You also anticipate the things that will happen the next day or the days after that. While you're sleeping, you already consider those and make decisions in advance.\" The less you give your brain the change to sort this shit out during REM sleep, the more dazed and confused you are during the day. This may explain why the seasoned stoner will often put off tasks and decisions until the very last minute: You failed to anticipate these issues properly, which is why you're late filing your taxes again, or can't remember where you left your house keys. Alcohol, surprisingly, has the opposite effect: If you go to bed shitfaced, the phases of REM sleep last longer. That is not to say that drinking two bottles of vodka before going to bed will help you get a good night's sleep. \"Too much alcohol suppresses the deep sleep and gives you more REM sleep, but it makes you more restless and wake up more often. If you drink way too much, you'll be twisting and turning all night and keep waking up,\" said Hamburger. Anyway, back to smoking weed. The effect pot has on your night's rest is clear. But why are your dreams so hyper-realistic and feverish after you stop smoking? \"If you've been taking a drug that suppresses a certain phenomenon for a while, then that phenomenon will come back stronger when you stop using that drug,\" explained Hamburger. \"That's what we call 'the rebound effect'\u2014which is also noticeable in people who take a lot of sleeping pills. If they stop taking those, they often get very strange and intense dreams. That is also often the reason why people keep taking those sleeping pills\u2014they become dependent on them, which is to say, addicted.\" In other words: your body goes into sprint-dream-mode, and that is why your dreams are so intense. According to Hamburger, the body recovers from the rebound effect on its own over time. \"It is a temporary attempt to catch up on all the dreaming you missed when you were smoking weed. It usually goes away after two to three weeks,\" he said. \"Your body will know when it's all caught up and ready to go back to business as usual.\"", "1 Share Share Tweet Share Share Email Poke\u0301mon Go trainer Nick Johnson has accomplished in a few weeks what many of us can only dream of: capture all 142 Poke\u0301mon available in the United States. The tech worker and certified Poke\u0301fan was the first person to announce such feat on Reddit alongside a screenshot of his Poke\u0301dex as proof. Now, he is taking on the challenge of catching the rest of the virtual monsters found only in other parts of the world by going off on an international trip. The best part of it all? His trip is going to be free. International travel firm Marriott Rewards has committed to sponsor Johnson\u2019s mission to catch the remaining Poke\u0301mon in Europe, Japan and Australia. The lucky jet-setting Poke\u0301mon Go trainer will be on the lookout for Mr. Mime, Farfetch\u2019d and Kangaskhan in his three destination continents. Finding the regionally-based Poke\u0301mon means he\u2019ll be able finish his collection. \"I feel great,\" Brooklyn-based Johnson told USA Today. \"I was getting a lot of rest and exercise and meeting new people. I\u2019m a lot healthier \u2014 I think I lost about 8-10 pounds.\" According to his iPhone Health App, he has traveled an average of 8 miles per day by walking since the game was released on July 6th. He said that during his hunting trips, he can be found roaming for the monsters until 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. Aside from the exercise, he also claims that the game has helped him perform better at work. Working for a platform innovation company, Johnson felt he was able to apply what he learned in his gaming experience with Poke\u0301mon Go. He cites his passion for his job and his childhood love for the Poke\u0301mon as his motivations to exerting extra effort in playing the game. Such dedication has led him to getting the ultimate perk of traveling the world to literally catch \u2018em all. \"My childhood dreams of being a Poke\u0301mon master have come true,\" he said.

Matthew Perry will play the quirky, quippy lead in mediocre sitcoms until he dies or gets bored, and Courteney Cox will draw eyeballs on TV when she wants to (though she\u2019s taking a justified break after the end of Cougar Town). Matt LeBlanc bounced around for a while (Episodes comes to an end next year) and is now hosting Top Gear. Lisa Kudrow continues to do weird, beautiful projects that get prematurely cancelled (The Comeback). But David Schwimmer has had, perhaps, the oddest, quietest career and after a few years of doing seemingly very little, he\u2019s returned to TV with a pair of high-profile roles in FX\u2019s OJ Simpson drama and now in his own vehicle, Feed the Beast. Whisper it, but after the McConaissance (Matthew McConaughey) and the Reesening (Reese Witherspoon), the Schwimmnaissance is finally here, and it\u2019s been overdue. The Friends reunion was a total car crash Besides some theater work, Schwimmer\u2019s big move after the end of Friends was providing the voice of Melman the giraffe in Madagascar. In an interview, Schwimmer explains why he was cast as Melman by describing the character as \"neurotic, and a hypochondriac, and paranoid\". Then, jokingly acknowledging his affinity with the character, Schwimmer swivels his head around as if hunting for the person who tricked him into being complicit in his own typecasting. Many of his other TV roles have boiled down to similar caricature, like an extended bit playing himself in the fourth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, where Schwimmer is brought in to replace his Madagascar co-star Ben Stiller as Leo Bloom in a production of The Producers in which Larry plays Bialystock. (Schwimmer mostly exists to fight with Larry about the cashew-raisin ratio in a bag of mixed nuts.) This seems ridiculous with time, as Stiller has remained a huge star, but it wasn\u2019t so out of the question at the time \u2013 Curb\u2019s fourth season aired in 2004, the same year Friends went off the air. However, Schwimmer\u2019s best post-Friends performances are largely against-type. As struggling actor Jared-turned eco-icon Greenzo on 30 Rock, he\u2019s an out-and-out asshole, rather than the asshole who thinks he\u2019s the nicest guy in the world. And the dramatic pinnacle of his career is a turn in Band of Brothers as the small-minded, petty Captain Sobel, where Schwimmer\u2019s capacity for resentment found a full outlet. But roles like this didn\u2019t keep coming, or at least Schwimmer didn\u2019t keep taking them. Add that to the internet\u2019s hatred for Ross Geller, and it seems clear: Schwimmer is a character actor trapped by the reputation accrued in a mistaken leading role. So it makes sense that he turned to directing, though this didn\u2019t prove a much better choice. Take his debut: Run Fatboy Run, a Simon Pegg vehicle about a cowardly man who leaves his pregnant fiancee at the altar, then wins her back by running really hard. The script is rather bleak, and it would be easy to imagine a version of the movie that underlines the absurdity of the whole premise. But Schwimmer directs Run Fatboy Run as a totally straight, inspirational story without only a hint of the misanthropy and surrealism the material seems to demand. David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian, Cuba Gooding Jr as OJ Simpson aka The Juice. It was a long few years in the wilderness, but Schwimmer was saved by another 90s icon: OJ Simpson. As Robert Kardashian in The People v OJ Simpson, Schwimmer manages to take the pathetic quality of Ross Geller \u2013 the hangdog look, drooping eyes, open mouth \u2013 and channel it into misplaced moral superiority as the only person in the courtroom who is actually convinced of OJ\u2019s innocence and thinks it matters. It helps that Schwimmer\u2019s committed performance has produced one of the best memes in a show committed to generating memes: a supercut of Schwimmer saying the word \"juice\". Schwimmer, sadly, does not say \"juice\" in Feed the Beast, the mob-chef drama that seems like it arose from the early brainstorming sessions for Burnt. He remains steadfastly unable to do a straight performance, without veering into meme territory. Schwimmer plays Tommy, a widower single father in the Bronx who works as a wine representative while drowning his dream of being a sommelier in a bottle and is struggling to raise his mute biracial son while dealing with his fresh-out-of-prison best friend, Dion (played by Jim Sturgess). His best moments on Feed the Beast are comic, responding to the gleeful mania of Jim Sturgess\u2019s Dion with a beat-down shrug. It\u2019s closer to the energy he has on 30 Rock or Curb. The bulk of Feed the Beast reads closer to Schwimmer\u2019s first big dramatic role: Duane Hopwood. The movie stars Schwimmer as the title character, a struggling casino pit boss in Atlantic City at odds with his ex-wife (Janeane Garofalo) and her new boyfriend (John Krasinski), navigating male bonding with his aspiring comedian friend (Judah Friedlander). Also, he\u2019s dealing with the fallout from a DUI, which forces him to ride a bike to work. For all the supposed seriousness of Duane Hopwood, the image of Schwimmer on a bike is indicative of the ways the movie is irrevocably of its time (a montage is set to Rockin\u2019 the Suburbs). It\u2019s one of several mid-00s vaguely whimsical dramas about men navigating adulthood with the tools of childhood, but one of the only ones that takes its project so seriously. (Duane begins to overcome his alcoholism after a single AA meeting, mystically lets go of his ex-wife, and doesn\u2019t even get that much blowback for driving over 80mph drunk with his daughter in the car.) Schwimmer plays Hopwood as an empty shell of a man, redeemed mostly because the script says so, and because it would be too depressing if he wound up alone. Like Duane Hopwood and much of his post-Friends career, Feed the Beast makes David Schwimmer a square peg in a role hole. He has to express serious levels of grieving, engage in complicated business transactions with his character\u2019s estranged father, and most dangerous of all, parent his child (who receives The Talk about cops in one of the series\u2019 more strained moments). None of these are flattering things to ask of Schwimmer, who has a strong skill set in other areas. (Namely, playing hyper-earnest parts that are easily digestible into memes. Sorry.) If the Schwimmnaissance is to have any hope of sticking, he\u2019ll have to find something a lot more square. (Namely, playing hyper-earnest parts that are easily digestible into memes.) This explains why Schwimmer\u2019s recent lip sync rap battle with James Corden was so successful \u2013 late-night talk shows are now essentially incubators for hyper-earnest memes.", "Anyone who's a regular thrifter or antique shopper knows that thrift stores are usually packed floor-to-ceiling with treasures that are just waiting to find a new home.

Turns out, the answer isn\u2019t entirely straightforward. Let\u2019s take a look. Know Your Laptop Battery For both types of batteries, the following statements are true (for modern laptops ): A battery cannot be overcharged. There\u2019s no danger of a battery being overcharged if you leave it plugged in all the time. As soon as it hits 100%, it will cease charging and won\u2019t start again until the voltage falls below a certain level. There\u2019s no danger of a battery being overcharged if you leave it plugged in all the time. As soon as it hits 100%, it will cease charging and won\u2019t start again until the voltage falls below a certain level. Fully discharging a battery will damage it. Having a battery fully discharged for an extended period can put it into a deep discharge state, from which it might never recover. So, based on this, do we conclude that you should simply leave your laptop plugged in all the time? Not quite. Things That Damage Lithium Batteries Charge/discharge cycles. Every battery has a finite number of times it can be charged and discharged. Every battery has a finite number of times it can be charged and discharged. Voltage level. The higher the charge level (measured in volts per cell), the shorter the battery\u2019s life. The higher the charge level (measured in volts per cell), the shorter the battery\u2019s life. High temperature, over 30 degrees celsius. This can cause irreparable damage. Charge Level Lithium-ion batteries charge to 4.20V/cell, which amounts to 100% of its capacity. At this level, the battery will have a lifespan of 300-500 discharge cycles. Every 0.10V/cell reduction in the charge doubles the number of discharge cycles, until the optimum is reached: 3.92V/cell, with 2400-4000 discharge cycles. Unfortunately, at this level the battery is only 58% charged, so the runtime will be little more than half of a fully-charged battery. Heat And then there\u2019s heat. Elevated temperatures, typically classified as being over 30 degrees celsius, will shorten the life of a battery irrespective of any other factors. Simply leaving your laptop in your car on a summer\u2019s afternoon is a bad idea. When the stress of high temperature combines with the stress of high voltage, the effects are even greater. The Battery University tests showed that a battery stored with a 40% charge at 40 degrees would see its capacity fall to 85% after a year. Charged to 100% the capacity falls to 65% under the same conditions. For a fully charged battery at 60 degrees the capacity plummets to 60% in just three months. The evidence seems clear. Keeping the battery permanently charged at 100% will slowly shorten its life. Keeping it at 100% and exposing it to high temperatures will shorten it much quicker. Should You Remove The Battery? If heat is such a danger, it begs another question. Should you remove the battery altogether when using your laptop on AC power? If you do choose to remove the battery, ensure that you store it properly. This means charged to between 40% and 70%, and kept at room temperature. Recommendations Curiously, the industry as a whole doesn\u2019t seem to have settled on a single answer for the question about whether to use your laptop on AC or battery power. Apple\u2019s advice is no longer on its website, but you can still read it online . The company recommends against leaving a laptop plugged in all the time. Instead, it suggests: An ideal user would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing Leaving your laptop plugged in will not cause short term damage, but if you only ever use it on AC power you\u2019ll almost certainly find that after a year the battery\u2019s capacity has been significantly reduced. Similarly, if you only ever use it on battery power you\u2019ll get through the battery\u2019s discharge cycles quicker. So, the best solution is something of a compromise between the two: use it on battery power some days, and keep it plugged in on others. And in all cases, you\u2019ll want to ensure it doesn\u2019t get too hot. How do you use your laptop? What steps do you take to keep your battery lasting for as long as possible?

The latest nugget to get tongues a-wagging concerns the game's famed \"multiplayer\" element. Developer Games has often claimed that the No Man's Sky universe is persistently online and players all inhabit it. But it has also constantly said because the playing field is so massive (18 quintillion procedurally generated planets), and players initially spawn in completely random areas, the chances of meeting another real human being are \"almost zero\". It certainly didn't expect that to happen on day one. Two players have posted proof on Reddit that they not only spawned close to each other, they set out to meet. And they ended up in exactly the same spot in the game, on the same planet, in the same galaxy, but things didn't quite turn out as expected. Twitch broadcaster TheSadCactus (TheGalacticCactus on Reddit) discovered that a system he visited had already been named by a different player, Psytokat. Whenever a new system or planet is found it can be renamed by the first player to arrive, so he knew that Psytokat else must have travelled through recently (as the game had only been out for a day). He arranged to meet his compatriot nearby and they headed to the same planet. They found a landmark and waited for each other to turn up. Neither did. That is to say, both arrived there but couldn't see each other. What's more, the lighting and area ambience was different. \"We are 100 per cent in the same station same spot and everything and we cannot see each other,\" said TheSadCactus. There are several speculated reasons for this. It could be a glitch, after all the game only went live yesterday and the servers were flooded. It could be that the two players were split into different lobbies online. Or it could be that you actually can't meet other players at all. Hello Games' founder Sean Murray had revealed in the past that it was possible to meet others, even suggesting that other players would be able to tell you what you look like: \"You can't see yourself,\" he told The Late Show's Stephen Colbert. \"The only way to know what you look like is for somebody else to see you. \"But the chances of that are incredibly rare because of the size of what we're building.\" Conspiracy theories aside, we wonder if it really matters. Hello Games has said all along that No Man's Sky is a single-player experience with some multiplayer factors, such as the naming and discovery of planets. And in that it does its job very well. It is, from what we've played so far, thoroughly engrossing.", "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Casey Affleck's performance in Manchester by the Sea was one of two tickets to the Oscars Best Actor race stamped at Sundance, the other being Nate Parker's for The Birth of a Nation. Surely poised to hit new career heights, the Park City breakouts harbored another similarity: Each had past allegations of sexual misconduct hiding in plain sight. Discussion of rape allegations against Parker have already effectively taken him out of Oscar contention; he's now spoken at great length about the case. But Affleck has sailed through so far without mention of the two women, a producer and a cinematographer, who in separate 2010 lawsuits accused him of boorish and harassing behavior \u2014 including unwelcome physical advances \u2014 while shooting the Joaquin Phoenix docu-farce I'm Still Here. Those cases, which sought more than $2 million each, were characterized as extortion attempts by Affleck's lawyer and settled out of court. Affleck declined through his publicist to speak with Mashable about the allegations, which were reported in the tabloid and trade press when they were filed just over six years ago. Now, with an Oscar nomination at stake for both actors, Parker is being routinely grilled, something he can expect to continue as Fox Searchlight rolls toward the Oct. 7 release of The Birth of a Nation, including a full junket and press conference scheduled for the Toronto Film Festival. Meanwhile, Affleck was just \"feted\" at the Telluride Film Festival, where he received a special tribute and gave multiple interviews tied to Manchester screenings that solidified his position as a Best Actor in the making. He was never asked about the allegations, or how they might be perceived vis a vis Parker. Nate Parker\u2019s history is reigniting the conflict between art and artist, and whether they should or can be separate. But the equation has a similar calculus when applied to Affleck's performance in Manchester by the Sea. Both actors were accused of behavior toward women that was sexual in nature, legally actionable in stature and not widely discussed or contemplated when first reported. But at the time, neither was a potential Best Actor nominee. Now, the spotlight shines brighter, and with it comes a fresh round of scrutiny. Their cases have fundamental differences, of course. Parker's was a criminal matter, while Affleck's was civil. Back in 1999, a 19-year-old Parker and eventual Nation co-story writer Jean Celestin were accused of raping a fellow Penn State student when she was unconscious and unable to consent. Parker was acquitted and Celestin's conviction was later vacated. Affleck, still best known as the younger brother of Ben, was in his mid-30s and already supporting-actor nominated for The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford when he was accused of repeatedly sexually harassing and berating two female colleagues during the 2009 production. One of the women accused Affleck of sneaking into her bed while she slept, then startling her awake in what was described in court papers as an unwelcome sexual advance. That case was filed by Magdalena Go\u0301rka, an experienced Polish cinematographer who, according to court documents filed in Los Angeles and obtained by Mashable, agreed in December 2008 to shoot I'm Still Here, the freewheeling (and later revealed as phony) documentary about Phoenix's transition from actor to rapper. The project attracted the most attention for Phoenix's odd, disheveled public behavior during production, including that infamous appearance on Late Night With David Letterman. What was going on behind the scenes, according to the lawsuits, was more unsettling. Go\u0301rka, the only woman on the crew, alleges the lewd comments began almost immediately and continued daily, including sexual advances and suggestions that she sleep with her camera assistant, Antony Langdon \u2014 one of Affleck's good buddies and the guitarist for the British/American rock band Spacehog \u2014 who was hired as part of the crew. (Langdon did not respond to requests for comment.) Tensions boiled over during filming in New York; Go\u0301rka says the crew was lodged in Affleck's apartment, where he offered to take the couch so she could use his bedroom. She says she put on a camisole and pajama pants and went to sleep, and that at some point Affleck snuck in and curled up next to her in the middle of the night. Gorka said she didn't know how long Affleck, who she claims reeked of alcohol, had been there. From the complaint: Affleck had his arm around her and was caressing her back and his face was right next to hers. ... Plaintiff was shocked and repulsed because she did not know where he had touched her while she was sleeping. ... [Go\u0301rka] immediately jumped up and told Affleck to get out of her bed. Affleck responded by asking \"Why?\" Plaintiff said \"Because you are married and because you are my boss.\" Affleck, undeterred, asked if Plaintiff \"was sure.\" Plaintiff said she was sure and insisted that he leave the room. Affleck left and slammed the door in anger. Affleck was married at the time to Summer Phoenix (the sister of Joaquin), though the couple separated earlier this year. Read the entirety of Go\u0301rka's lawsuit here: Though Go\u0301rka confronted Affleck the next morning and left the project, she was convinced weeks later to return by Amanda White, a producer on I'm Still Here, according to the documents. Assured that White would be present during production and hopeful that another woman on set would tamp down the harassment, Go\u0301rka came back. But the hostile environment persisted, she says, including a night in Costa Rica when Affleck and Phoenix locked themselves inside the women's shared room. Crew members told them the brothers-in-law were in there having sex with two other women, despite the fact that they had their own rooms, the documents claim. Go\u0301rka's stories were corroborated by White \u2014 the producer who'd convinced her to return, and who had known Affleck for more a decade \u2014 in a lawsuit White filed just days before Go\u0301rka's. Besides recounting Go\u0301rka's allegations, White says Affleck harassed her, too. According to White's suit, Affleck ordered Go\u0301rka's camera assistant Langdon (above) to show her his genitals on a plane, which he did despite her protests; tried to manipulate White into staying in his hotel room on location in San Francisco and when she refused, \"violently\" grabbed her arm; and later berated and intimidated White and Go\u0301rka during a meeting at his home, where he \"grew livid with [White] when she refused to succumb to his intimidation tactics.\" She also describes a Las Vegas shoot that Affleck set up with several prostitutes crowded into a hotel room \u2014 a scene that White says never made the movie because it was set up solely for the director's \"personal gratification.\" But a good chunk of White's tale involved watching what Go\u0301rka had to endure, allegedly at the hands of Affleck and Langdon, according to the documents, which claim: During the course of production, Langdon also made repeated sexual advances towards Gorka in the presence of [White], Affleck and Phoenix. Gorka was harassed by Langdon on an almost daily basis. Langdon routinely referred to the size of his penis; asked Gorka out on dates; and discussed sexually explicit conduct. ... Although Landgdon's advances were unsolicited and Gorka complained about the work environment, she was forced to continue working directly with Langdon. Read the entirety of White's lawsuit here: Martin Singer, bulldog attorney to the stars who represented Affleck in both cases, filed a lengthy motion July 27, 2010, just days after White's lawsuit and before Go\u0301rka's, to compel the matter into arbitration. But more than seeking an out-of-court venue, the filing implied that White had \"concocted this fabricated sexual harassment lawsuit over a year after she failed in her devious attempt [to] extort a better production deal.\" The motion, obtained by Mashable, included references to emails between White and Affleck that were friendly and professional in nature \u2014 not an unusual dynamic in cases of abuse \u2014 including well-wishes and thank-yous apparently sent after she had left I'm Still Here. It also said the attorney who filed White's lawsuit, Brian Procel, tried to renegotiate her deal months before any accusations of harassment flew. Read the entire response here: The motion was never granted, nor would it need to be. Six weeks later, among the hype and confusion that surrounded the release of I'm Still Here (which Affleck and Phoenix were still stubbornly insisting was a real documentary, though few believed them), the Los Angeles Times published a long story about Phoenix, the actor, possibly coming out of his bizarre \"retirement.\" Buried deep within the item was an update on the harassment cases: Affleck had settled with White and Go\u0301rka. A joint statement from both sides read simply: The disputes between Flemmy Productions, LLC and Casey Affleck with Amanda White and Magdalena Gorka in connection with the film 'I'm Still Here' have been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. A few weeks later, on October 4, 2010, both Go\u0301rka and White separately filed requests that their lawsuits be dismissed. The amount of money exchanged in the settlements, if any, was not disclosed, and the matter was ended. If Affleck indeed paid Go\u0301rka and White, whatever they recovered likely came with ironclad legal guarantees that they never speak to anyone about the case. Each is still listed in the I'm Still Here credits; neither responded to Mashable's request for comment. White has moved on to television specials, while Go\u0301rka immediately shifted to Paranormal Activity 3, and has shot several smaller-scale feature films since, the most recent being An Ordinary Man, a 2017 war-crimes drama starring Peter Serafinowicz and Ben Kingsley. But there's no telling what real impact the lawsuit has had on her Hollywood trajectory. Go\u0301rka's original filing took the unusual step of pointing out that she was a first-time accuser and was concerned about damage to her reputation that speaking out might inflict: During her 16 years working in the entertainment industry, [Go\u0301rka] has never accused anyone of sexual harassment. She has never filed a lawsuit against anyone for any reason. And she has struggled with her decision to file this lawsuit \u2014 she is justifiably concerned about the effect this lawsuit will have on her career. She notes that the experience, after 16 years of working with top directors and cinematographers, was \"the most traumatizing of her career\" \u2014 suggesting that the on-set harassment of women is hardly isolated to what you read in court filings. Now the matter goes to the court of the Film Academy's voters, most of whom have spent their fair share of time on movie sets. But in the wake of Nate Parker, they may also be less inclined to separate the art from the artist.", "Richard Belzer is leaving \"Law & Order: SVU.\" Belzer, who has been with the show since it began 15 seasons ago, is leaving \"SVU\" as a series regular. He's been playing the character of John Munch for more than 20 years. Belzer's character turned in his retirement papers at the end of the Wed., Oct. 9 episode of \"SVU.\" Look for his retirement party in the Oct. 16 episode. While he may be leaving the show as a series regular, don't expect Belzer to say goodbye to the character of John Munch forever. A source confirmed Belzer is expected to make recurring appearances on the long-running NBC drama. \"I'd be a fool to say I didn't want to do it anymore and I'm certainly not bored with the character because the writing is so good,\" Belzer told The Huffington Post in May 2013. \"[Munch is] very close to how I would be if I were in that situation, so it's a dream.\" The character of John Munch first made his debut on \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" in 1993. The character has also appeared on \"The X-Files,\" \"The Beat,\" \"Arrested Development,\" \"The Wire,\" \"Law & Order\" and \"Law & Order: Trial By Jury.\" Belzer has made more than 450 episodic television appearances as John Munch.

I know it\u2019s a bad habit, but sometimes you just can\u2019t help it. But since I learned about the unhealthy side effects that some people experience, I\u2019ve been able to stop cold turkey, and when you learn about it you will too. Some people are so compulsive with their nail biting that they don\u2019t just damage the nails, they chew past the front of the nail and eat the skin around them. Sure, it looks bad, but is it really harming anyone? Well, yes. A condition called dermatophagia can be developed as a result of nail biting, and it can pose a danger to your nail bed. In extreme cases, it can cause permanent damage. You can get infections in your fingers from the bacteria in your saliva, not to mention the wounds around your nails. In extreme situations, you can even get irreversible nerve damage. Imagine if your nails looked like this for the rest of your life. So if you bite your nails, stop before it\u2019s too late!", "Former Stanford student Brock Turner will serve just three months of his six-month sentence, a document on the Santa Clara County's Depart of Corrections website reveals. Turner was convicted in March on three felony counts of sexual assault. According to Turner's inmate details, which are available to the public, he will be released on Sept. 2, 2016. Screenshot of the County of Santa Clara's inmate details for Brock Turner Source: County of Santa Clara Public Information Officer Sgt. James Jensen, from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office, said over the phone the date that appears on the site is indeed when the court has instructed officials to release Turner, although he could not say that the sentence has been formally shortened. When asked if it's possible that the release date suggests Brock may be moved to another corrections facility, Jensen said, \"That would not be a possibility.\" \"If it says he's getting released on that date \u2014 unless there's some special circumstance and he receives new criminal charges while in prison and were to be charged \u2014 that is the date of his release,\" said Jensen. An unnamed representative from the same sheriff's office told TMZ that Turner is being held in \"protective custody\" away from any inmates who aren't also in protective custody, and will have an escort who will accompany him on prison grounds. According to the representative, Turner was eligible to receive these protections by virtue of him serving time for sexual assault and \"those type of inmates are often targeted,\" wrote TMZ staff.

So if you're going through a breakup right now, we have the perfect support for you. A group of people have taken to anonymous confession website Whisper to share their moment of closure and sweet, sweet relief. Here are some of the best:   [I] Saw my ex on an episode of Cops. I dodged a bullet for sure. Found out my ex voted for Trump... Never been more glad we broke up. Got a bank statement for my ex. So glad we broke up. She is too old to be that shitty with money. My ex got matching name tattoos with her fiance\u0301 of three months.  My ex-boyfriend feared his future kids would turn out gay/lesbian. Thank God we broke up. I re-read screenshots from the end of my last relationship. I didn\u2019t realise how insane and borderline abusive my ex was at the time \u2013 so glad to say I\u2019m at least ten times happier now. I ran into my ex, who casually mentioned that he was high from Windex. I\u2019m so glad I ended that relationship. My ex-boyfriend thinks I \"got cancer\" to get his attention. Yes I gave myself cancer so you would pay attention to me. I\u2019m so glad we broke up. On a friend\u2019s Snapchat I saw my ex so drunk he was unconscious and had dicks drawn on his face... While I\u2019m over here planning my wedding. Oh boy, I dodged a bullet. He hasn\u2019t changed.", "2637 329 0 I have a take. And it\u2019s not hot. Actually, it\u2019s not even a take, it\u2019s a fact. And that fact is that badminton is the best sport at the Olympic games. My colleagues Luke Kerr-Dineen and Nate Scott have tried to brainwash you into thinking that I have a take. And it\u2019s not hot. Actually, it\u2019s not even a take, it\u2019s a fact. And that fact is that badminton is the best sport at the Olympic games. My colleagues Luke Kerr-Dineen and Nate Scott have tried to brainwash you into thinking that equestrian and rugby sevens are the best, but they are very wrong and I am very right. Trust me, because I know about badminton. When I wasn\u2019t watching the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team lose to the Ikea-demons (aka Sweden) I have spent today transfixed by the badminton livestream. The speed with which these players move is truly staggering, and the fast-pace kept my attention which, in the age of multiple screens at multiple times, is no easy feat. I can\u2019t even make it through a full episode of Friends anymore without checking my phone. I am a true millennial disgrace. But I digress. What matters more than my embarrassing attention span is that have extensive experience playing badminton in my grandmother\u2019s backyard with my cousins using the broken rackets that spent most of the year acting as homes for families of spiders in my grandparents\u2019 garage. So between the amount I\u2019ve watched today and the amount I played as a child, I am basically a badminton expert. Which puts me in the unique position of being able to tell you all exactly why badminton is the G.O.A.T., the Simone Biles, the Michael Phelps of Olympic sports. Which is that, as you watch it, you might think to yourself, \"Hey, maybe I could actually do that.\" This never happens when you watch the Olympics during primetime. If you, as someone who is not on an elite swim team, are delusional enough to think you could hop in a pool and give Katie Ledecky a swim for her money, then you\u2019re out of your gourd. If you aren\u2019t a gymnast, thinking you could even walk on a balance beam, let alone flip over on one, would be like a blogger saying to a pilot, \"No, no, trust me, I can fly this thing.\" Badminton, however, is a sport where you can trick yourself into thinking that maybe, if you really put your mind to it, you could be a contender. You can\u2019t, of course. These athletes have trained for years, have dedicated their lives to this, have fast-twitch muscles that are faster than those of a cat chasing a laser beam that you\u2019ve aimed at the floor to drive it crazy. There\u2019s no way you could do what they\u2019re doing because they are elite and you are not. But, given the backyard memories (that Mary Carillo But, given the backyard memories (that Mary Carillo so brilliantly espoused on her incredible 2004 broadcast from Athens) that are so often attached to the game, there\u2019s that voice in the back of your head whispering, \"it could still be you.\" Even as you watch these professionals make impossible shots that in no world could you ever return, you allow yourself to dream. And what are sports for, if not to inspire us to chase our delusional hopes and live our best lives and never give up and always take 100% of the shots? Nothing. So if inspiration is the metric by which we\u2019re judging \"best\" (and I have decided that it is), badminton is the ultimate. Thus it is proven.", "Whether you\u2019ve got a button nose, a hook nose, or a Roman nose, you can blame a specific group of five genes for the shape of your honker, according to a new study that appears in the journal Nature Communications. When it comes to appearances, humans are probably the most diverse species on the planet, coming in all shapes and sizes. This goes as much for our faces as our bodies, and of course one of the most prominent items on the facial landscape is the schnoz. Differences in nasal design are thought to be driven by a number of evolutionary adaptations, such as the need for nostrils of a particular size in order to control the volume and temperature of inhaled air. The fact that humans tend to recognize each other by sight rather than smell (in most cases!) is another key driver of our wildly varying facey bits. Surprisingly, these enormous differences in nose shape and size are controlled by a rather small number of genes, which, according to the study authors, encode for specific characteristics such as nostril width, \"pointiness,\" and the inclination of the bridge of the nose. To discover this, the researchers looked at photographs of 6,275 people from across Latin America, cross-referencing these images with a full analysis of their genomes, obtained via a DNA sample. In particular, the study authors analyzed 14 different facial traits, seeking out any genetic similarities between people with similar features. Amazingly, the researchers were able to pinpoint five genes that seem to code for specific nasal traits. For instance, a gene called DCHS2 \u2013 which plays a role in controlling cartilage formation \u2013 was found to have a major influence over the pointiness of a person\u2019s nose. Another gene, called PAX1, was identified as a driver of nostril breadth, while RUNX2, which is involved in bone growth, is vital for nose bridge width. This knowledge could have major implications for the treatment of inherited facial deformations. Conditions such as Campomelic Dysplasia, for instance, are associated with a range of craniofacial defects, and are thought to be caused by mutations in genes controlling the development of cartilage.", "Mussoorie may be a picturesque town of Himachal Pradesh but like many places in the country, it too grapples with severe water crisis. Whatever may be the efforts of the government to tackle the crisis, a famous temple in the town decided to do something that is worth a standing ovation. Sanatan Dharma Mandir is one of the oldest temples of Mussoorie. Thronged by scores of devotees all through the year, the temple is frequented by many Shiva bhakts. As is tradition, people pour water over the lingam with vessels made from copper of various sizes. And this is what gave the temple authorities an idea to help save water without breaking tradition. According to this report in the TOI, the temple officials decided to replace all the larger vessels with those of smaller sizes. Also See Download our Android App And Stay Up-To-Date The report says that at the start of the summer season \u2013 when water scarcity is particularly severe \u2013 the temple bought two dozen small vessels. They are gradually phasing out all the big and medium size vessels. The result is that everyone is happy, including environmentalists. The devotees continue to follow rituals and traditions, and the temple has sent out a strong message in water conservation. \"Symbolic gestures like these help spread awareness of the need for water conservation,\" the report quotes an environmentalist as saying. The town needs around 14.5 million litres per day but gets only about half of it from local springs and brooklets."]
