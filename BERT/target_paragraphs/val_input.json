["The US economy's biggest problem will soon be a lack of available workers, according to ADP Research Institute. \"Businesses are having a more difficult time filling open job positions, which are near record highs,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said in a report. The institute's monthly report on private payrolls, out Wednesday, showed an increase of 179,000 in July. Economists had forecast a rise of 170,000, according to Bloomberg. The gain in June was revised up by 4,000, to 176,000. But the overall pace of job creation is slowing as the economy approaches full employment, which is a level where virtually all who are willing and able to work are employed. Some economists see a slowdown in the number of people businesses are hiring as the natural outcome of an unemployment rate as low as 4.8%, although weaker capital spending and lackluster earnings growth have raised separate concerns. \"As the labor market continues to tighten, small businesses may increasingly face challenges when it comes to offering wages that can compete with larger businesses,\" Ahu Yildirmaz, head of the ADP Research Institute, said in the release. Goods-producing companies lost 4,000 jobs, fewer than in June, as manufacturing employment increased. The construction industry lost 5,000 private payrolls. This data comes ahead of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' numbers on Friday, which are projected to show an increase of 180,000 in nonfarm payrolls.", "A Missouri lawmaker caused a firestorm of controversy last week after he tweeted disparaging comments about teens wearing T-shirts that support gay-straight alliances. Rep. Kevin Elmer (R-Nixa) reportedly tweeted Thursday: \"Nixa Schools failure. HS students working elementary school book fair in gay [T]-shirts.\" Attached to the tweet, which has since been deleted, was a picture of a teenage girl in a shirt featuring representations of gay and lesbian couples and the word \"HARMONY.\" The photo showed only the girl\u2019s torso, according to The Springfield News-Leader. Elmer had been at a book fair at his third-grade child\u2019s school when he saw several teens wearing the shirts. He told the Leader that he took issue with those garments being worn around young students, as he felt their message could interfere with his ability to parent on issues such as same-sex relationships. \"My wife and I know our kids better than anyone else and, when it\u2019s time to breach certain subjects to talk about certain areas, that should be up to us as parents,\" said Elmer, according to local outlet KY3. However, he said he is not opposed to students belonging to gay-straight alliances, called GSAs for short. \"The shirt itself is not offensive. It\u2019s what it was advocating for and questioning whether or not that advocacy needs to happen at the K through [fourth-grade] level,\" he said in a KY3 interview Friday afternoon. \"It wasn\u2019t a criticism of the students themselves. It was a question as to whether or not that advocacy needed to happen in that environment.\" Still, students at the school and gay rights advocates are firing back at the state representative. \"You're entitled to your own opinion, but don't break people down. We're here about harmony and that's what we're tying to do,\" Awreon Riley, a sophomore at Nixa High School and president of the school's GSA, told local outlet KSPR-TV. PROMO, a statewide LGBT advocacy organization, wrote a news release in support of the school\u2019s GSA students. \"Every day, Missouri students are subjected to some form of bullying. Research shows that schools with active Gay Straight Alliances provide a safe environment for students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) and their allies. HARMONY at Nixa High School is one such GSA, and we support them,\" said Stephanie Perkins, deputy director of PROMO, according to KY3.

Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) stars in a new ad making the conservative case for the legalization of same-sex marriage, as a federal appeals court prepares to take up the issue. \"I was raised here, Cody, Wyoming,\" says Simpson in the spot. \"It was a town of western values: independence, freedom. I'm a Republican and the party's basic core is government out of your life and the right to be left alone.

Live and let live,\" he adds. \"It is very simple.\" The 30-second spot is being released by Freedom to Marry. According to the group, the ad will begin airing Tuesday on national cable and network Sunday political shows in Washington, D.C., and in Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming markets. \"Speaking as a conservative, a lifelong Republican, and a son of the West, Senator Simpson talks of his values of freedom and limited government and the joy of marriage, Freedom to Marry President Evan Wolfson said in a statement. \"The ad shows the bipartisan momentum for the freedom to marry. And recent rulings against marriage discrimination by nine out of nine federal district judges show the legal trajectory of our campaign: toward more freedom, more dignity, and more families enjoying equality under the law.\" Last month, Simpson joined a group of Republicans in filing a friend-of-the-court brief in the 10th Circuit in support of the freedom to marry. The 10th Circuit took up the issue after federal judges in Utah and Oklahoma struck down the states' constitutional bans on marriage equality. The federal appeals court will hear the Utah case on Thursday, and the Oklahoma case on April 17.

Players are generally seen using incense whenever they are at home, work or any other place where they are unable to take a stroll in search of Pokemon. However, a Redditor called __isitin__ has discovered that the coding of Pokemon Go doesn\u2019t help the players much who uses incense without any movement. Generally, incense spawns a Pokemon every five minutes when the players are not making any movement. This spawning rate, however, can be increased to one per minute if the players manages to move 200 meters in between every spawn. At that rate, the players will need to cover one kilometer in five minutes to get the maximum out of the Incense. The players will actually need to jog at a speed of 12 kilometer per hour to meet this target. Although on paper they should be able to collect 30 Pokemon while travelling at this speed using incense, the server and the faulty tracking system of the game will reduce it to 10-15, which is also a good number. So, it is advisable for players not to use the incense while sitting down or not making any movement. Incense is a rare item and the players will receive it for free only while leveling up, and therefore it makes more sense to use it along with the tips mentioned above to get far better results with your Pokemon catching escapades.", "Shamus Beaglehole Wins 2014 Name of the Year Contest", "Next year ends in a 7. If you\u2019re superstitious or a little loose with statistics, that makes us due for another financial crisis. The biggest one-day stock drop in Wall Street history happened in 1987. The Asian crisis was in 1997. And the worst global meltdown since the Great Depression got rolling in 2007 with the failure of mortgage lenders Northern Rock in the U.K. and New Century Financial in the U.S. You can\u2019t really mark the next crisis down on your calendar, of course. The point is that crackups come fairly regularly. And some of the prerequisites for the next one do seem to be falling into place. The International Monetary Fund may have gotten things about right in its annual Global Financial Stability Report, which was issued in October. It doesn\u2019t sound an alarm but expresses concern. Short-term risks have actually abated, the IMF says, pointing to rebounding commodity prices, which help some key emerging markets, and the prospect of easier money in developed markets. But, it says, \"medium-term risks continue to build.\" It cites the unsettled political climate, which makes entrenched problems harder to tackle; some weak financial institutions in developed markets; and heavy corporate debts in emerging markets. Risks that aren\u2019t acute can build for a while before triggering a crisis. What\u2019s indisputable is that debt, the tinder of almost every financial conflagration, is growing rapidly. At 225 percent of world gross domestic product, combined public and private debt outside the financial sector \"is currently at an all-time high,\" the IMF says. Debt fuels growth but also makes borrowers brittle. Debtors keep owing money even if they lose the ability to repay. If they default, their lenders are damaged and sometimes default on their own obligations, and so the dominoes fall. The world\u2019s banks are mostly stronger now than they were on the eve of the last financial crisis, but there are important exceptions. The stock of Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s biggest, has fallen 62 percent from its 2015 high, and Chief Executive Officer John Cryan has so far resisted an obvious solution to shore up the bank, namely raising money by issuing new shares, which would dilute the ownership of current shareholders. The German government, having inveighed against bailouts for southern European banks, is insisting it won\u2019t reverse course now for its own bank. In Italy, meanwhile, troubled loans on banks\u2019 books equal about one-quarter of the nation\u2019s GDP. Even in the U.S., investors don\u2019t appear to regard big banks as any safer now than they were before the last crisis, according to a paper issued by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Natasha Sarin, a Harvard graduate student. The stock prices of the big U.S. banks are uncomfortably low, Summers and Sarin say, which implies that their \"franchise value\" has been eroded. That suggests that in a crisis they might have a hard time paying off their debts by liquidating assets. Ultralow interest rates aren\u2019t helping banks\u2019 ability to withstand a crisis. They squeeze profits\u2014which banks need to build up their safety cushion\u2014by reducing the amount banks can earn on the loans they make. It\u2019s not only the level of rates but also the small difference between the short-term rates at which banks borrow and the long-term rates at which they lend. Two regulations that take effect in 2018 will begin to pinch in 2017 as banks prepare to comply with them. One, from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, strictly limits the amount of leverage that banks can use to make money. Another requires them to recognize expected loan losses more quickly. Although the rules should make banks safer, they could also further reduce their profits. If banks keep trying to thread the needle\u2014scraping by without turning to shareholders for more capital\u2014they could become even more vulnerable. Whatever the stresses on conventional banks, they probably pose less of a risk than the shadow banking system, says Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish, a unit of BNY Mellon. The \"design failure\" of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to reform Wall Street is that by raising the cost of operating a conventional bank, it pushed some money toward less regulated shadow banks, Reinhart says. The shadow banking system includes hedge funds, money-market mutual funds, and Wall Street securities lenders and borrowers. China may be the scariest source of risk on the horizon. Its growth rate has been driven by unsustainably rapid expansion of lending to businesses and households, says Bloomberg Intelligence Chief Asia Economist Tom Orlik. The government has signaled, through an editorial in the state-run press, that it wants the country to start deleveraging. \"So far it is not clear if words will be matched with deeds,\" Orlik wrote on Oct. 11. Chinese banks are \"the major risk, a potential detonator,\" says Samuel Malone, director of specialized modeling at Moody\u2019s Analytics. He looked at the size, fragility, and interconnectedness of the world\u2019s biggest banks and concluded that China\u2019s Southeast Asian neighbors, particularly Singapore, are most directly exposed. China\u2019s shadow banking system is huge and poorly understood, and the losses that it suffers could quickly be transmitted to conventional banks.", "The season finale of NBC reality show The Voice is airing tonight, and the winner will be announced in a matter of minutes.

A study by hiring software provider Cangrade revealed that being intellectually stimulated is the most important aspect of an employee's job satisfaction. Specially, those surveyed said intellectual stimulation accounts for 18.5 percent of their job satisfaction. That's compared to money, which accounts for just 5.4 percent of how happy an employee is with the job. Achievement and prestige, power and influence, work-life balance and affiliation and friendship were all rated more important to job satisfaction than money. \"These findings are quite surprising, because employers often assume things like income are the strongest drivers of happiness in the workplace,\" said Steve Lehr, Cangrade's chief science officer. \"In fact, our research shows that it may be the weakest.\" Researchers developed a three-part formula for employers who are eager to keep their staff happy: Try to ensure that jobs provide intellectual stimulation and task variety. Give employees some autonomy, influence and opportunities to acquire prestige and recognition. Employers should give employees these things even when they don't say they need them. Give them even more if they say they do. Employers should give all employees a break now and again, including the consummate workaholics who say they don't want or need it. Offer employees extra money, security and social opportunities. However, only to the extent they say these things matter to them. \"If there is a major takeaway here, it's that we can finally prove that money doesn't buy happiness, and that happiness isn't as elusive as we might think,\" said Cangrade CEO Michael Burtov. The study was based on surveys of nearly 600 U.S. employees.", "All the best foods are doused in garlic, but what about the lonely times that come after the clove cramming? When accused of housing that garlicky stench, I tend to take offence and charge them with being ungrateful for me protecting them from vampires. But if that doesn\u2019t work, maybe you should try one of these scientifically proven odour eaters. Researchers from Ohio State University found that the best foods to banish garlic breath are raw apple and raw lettuce, the Huffington Post reports. Volunteers were asked to chew garlic cloves for 25 seconds before trying water; raw, juiced or heated apple; raw or heated lettuce; raw or juiced mint leaves; or green tea, immediately after. Heated lettuce sounds fucking grim. The researchers said foods deodorise garlic breath through two mechanisms \u2013 first, enzymes in the raw foods help to destroy the odours, and then, phenolic compounds in both the raw and cooked foods destroy the volatiles. Wikipedia They believe this is why raw foods were the most effective because they contain both the enzymes and the phenolic compounds. Although it didn\u2019t get rid of the volatiles, mint leaves were best at masking the smell. Plus, an apple a day keeps the odours away. To be honest, this has just made me really want to scoff a load of garlic bread (I\u2019ll get some lettuce as well!).", "The Pulitzer Prize has broadened eligibility in feature writing and investigative reporting to include online and print magazines, the Pulitzer Prize Board announced in a press release on Monday. In the past, publications that identified as magazines, either in print or online, were not allowed to compete for a Pulitzer in any category. But as an increasing number of Americans turn to digital media for their daily news, and many print magazines publish weekly and operate their own websites, the decision to broaden the spectrum makes sense. \"Pulitzer\u2019s aim was the progress and elevation of journalism,\" Pulitzer Prize administrator Mike Pride said in a statement. \"He envisioned that future generations would make changes in the Plan of Award for the prizes that are 'conducive to the public good or rendered advisable by public necessities, or by reason of change of time.' Increasingly, online and print magazines have expanded their mission. It\u2019s time to enlarge the tent again.\" While websites operated by broadcast news organizations remain ineligible, and the prize continues to be primarily focused on text, the Pulitzer Prize Board acknowledges that the web has provided new and compelling ways for journalists to integrate the written word with multimedia content. \"Consistent with its historical focus on text-based journalism, the Board will continue to place emphasis on the enduring value of words and of serious reporting,\" the press release read, \"while also recognizing the opportunity provided by the web for integration of text with audio and visual elements to strengthen story-telling and provide information and analysis.\"", "iStock Today's at-home chefs are more likely to cook with an iPhone instead of a recipe book. They're more likely to draw their inspirations from a Facebook video. And they're more likely to post a photo of what they cook on Instagram or Pinterest. One other big change: They're more likely to be men. A higher proportion of American men \u2014 43 percent \u2014 are cooking these days than at any point in the past 30 years. Meanwhile, they're spending more time than ever before \u2014 49 minutes a day \u2014 doing so. Those are up from 38 percent and 40 minutes two decades ago. By contrast, 70 percent of women cook these days, a bump from the 67 percent that cooked two decades ago but a definite decline from the 88 percent of women who cooked 40 years ago. And they're spending 71 minutes a day cooking, also a small increase from 20 years ago but less than the 101 minutes they spent 40 years ago. You can see these trends in the following two charts, which come from a 2013 study by researchers at the University of North Carolina who used the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 American Time Use Survey. What's driving the trends? The higher level of cooking overall among men and women may be driven by an era of stagnant wages that makes cooking at home the more affordable option, as well as the fact that broad Internet access and the popularity of social media make it more fun and easier to do than perhaps ever before. While women are cooking at about the same rates they have been for several decades, it's the surge in men's cooking at home that may be most noticeable. Companies that make money off food are weighing how to take advantage of the trend, deciding whether to treat cooking as a distinctly masculine activity or to show foodie-ism as a gender-neutral hobby. Those that invoke a manly-man approach to cooking sometimes hawk bacon, burgers and brews, or else emphasize a testosterone-drizzled palate that helps craft a chiseled bod. Kevin Curry, founder of the blog Fit Men Cook, said men in the kitchen are following what men had been doing since the beginning of humanity: hunting and providing food for themselves and their families. \"It\u2019s a masculine quality to want to physically put food on the table and make it taste good,\" Curry said. The success of Curry\u2019s blog alone suggests just how big the male cooking market is. Founded on Tumblr in 2012, it\u2019s now a profitable website with a Facebook following of a quarter-million users. \"The first thing we do as men is make everything a competition,\" Curry said. \"When we get a new car, we\u2019ll say to our friends, \u2018Hey man, look at the rims on this.\u2019 Same with food, we\u2019ll post on Facebook like, \u2018Look what I just made, this is bad y\u2019all, I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 It creates this competitive culture, and as men, we gravitate towards that.\" The most pervasive trend is reality competition cooking shows, which have taken the Food Network by storm. The number of food competition shows on the Food Network increased from two in 2005 to 16 in 2014, according to Quartz. These shows try to demonstrate that cooking is \"not for sissies,\" said Daphne Kasriel Alexander, \u200ea consumer trends consultant at \u200eEuromonitor International. That can help explain the popularity of expletive-spewing male chefs like Gordon Ramsay, whose abrasive personality alone has become a meme. \"That's an example of brands responding to this interest,\" Alexander said. Young men are particularly attracted to these shows, said Deirdre O'Hearn, senior vice president of programming and development at the Food Network and Cooking Channel. O\u2019Hearn said millennial men were interested in personality-driven shows, such as the popular series with Alton Brown. \"These shows appeal to men because we are competitive by nature, coupled with the fact that we \u2018see ourselves\u2019 since a majority of the contestants are male,\" Curry said. Other companies distance themselves from gender norms, even doing away with them entirely by casting men and women as having shared family roles. Matt Salzberg, founder and chief executive of meal-kit company Blue Apron, said his company attracts people because of the growing interest in good food and the experience of cooking. Instead of reinforcing gender roles, Blue Apron sends the message that cooking at home can strengthen relationships. \"Now that more women are not the primary caretakers of the home, families are more collaborative with household chores,\" Salzberg said. \"There's a lot of opportunity for men to cook as well. It\u2019s enabling a whole new generation of folks to get into the kitchen.\" Home cook Mark Dang, a 30-something biotech employee in San Diego, said cooking has become increasingly gender-less. \"Guys my age are more inclined to step foot in the kitchen thanks to gender equality and division of household responsibilities,\" Dang said. \"Both genders work, so cooking is not a default chore for women.\" The charts below demonstrate how much millennial cooking men and women say they do at home. While men are more likely to say they don't cook, the genders are equally likely to claim responsibility for most or all of the home's meal preparation. Experts say food companies are seeking to entice men by invoking the foodie trend \u2014 those folks that seek new eating experiences at food trucks and farm-to-table or pop-up restaurants and post their tastiest meals on Instagram. Alexander of Euromonitor suggested that young men are cooking more as millennials tend to be less bound within gender norms. \"Among millennials, gender roles are less fixed,\" Alexander said. \"It doesn't seem so shocking to hear that men are cooking.\"", "California Assemblyman Rocky Cha\u0301vez announced Tuesday that he is exploring a bid for the Golden State's open U.S. Senate seat in 2016, becoming the first sitting Republican lawmaker to take a formal step toward running for retiring Democratic Sen.

Cha\u0301vez, who represents part of San Diego County, has opened an exploratory committee, allowing him to fundraise for the statewide race. \"Our nation suffers from a lack of clear leadership when it comes to issues of national security and looking out for California families who have seen stagnant wage growth for almost two decades,\" Cha\u0301vez said in a statement. \"My story is like that of so many other California families, having worked in the grape fields with my uncle and cousins as a child to seeing one of my own children attend an Ivy League medical school. That's the American Dream, and it's what every parent hopes to see for their own children. But if we don't take steps to protect our nation and help create more opportunities for our children, we risk losing that Dream.\" While Boxer's retirement spurred a flurry of activity among the state's high-profile Democrats, California conservatives haven't been as eager to jump in what is likely to be an expensive campaign. Well-known Republicans like Rep. Darrell Issa, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and 2014 gubernatorial candidate Neel Kashkari have all denied interest in the seat. \"I would love to say a Republican has a really decent chance,\" Republican strategist Beth Miller told the Los Angeles Times earlier this month. \"But right now, given what the political landscape looks like in California, it will be an uphill battle for any Republican.\" On the Democratic side, California Attorney General Kamala Harris announced her candidacy last month.

Though the government has been hard at work to improve public transport around Manila, people need to start following traffic rules and regulations for any significant improvement to occur, Transportation Undersecretary Annelie Lontoc said in an interview on Monday, July 18. For starters, a more streamlined enforcement system is being tested on EDSA, Lontoc said. The government has divided the busy thoroughfare into 10 traffic zones, each with its own dedicated personnel from the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the Highway Patrol Group (HPG) to enforce traffic rules. Each of these zones will also have access to tow trucks, a quick response team on motorcycles, and personnel from the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to help with illegally parked cars and \"colorum\" (out-of-line) vehicles. Despite all the government\u2019s efforts, however, Lontoc insisted that peoples\u2019 driving habits need to change before the traffic situation can improve. According to Lontoc, since the MMDA re-implemented the No Contact Apprehension Policy in April, more than 25,000 vehicles have been apprehended. \"We really need discipline,\" said Lontoc when asked about driving habits. \"We can\u2019t just rely on enforcement. Car users need to follow the rules themselves. The roads are already so congested that anything that can stop traffic \u2013 like stalled vehicles \u2013 will cause it to accumulate.\" Overall, however, Lontoc believes that the traffic crisis can be resolved. \"If we maintain our lane, if we are defensive drivers, we can avoid it,\" she said, referring to congestion in the streets. \"As long as the road is moving, the cooperation of everyone to make the traffic flow is really a big deal,\" she added. Improvements coming to public transportation In relation to Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella\u2019s statement that traffic in Metro Manila would improve within the next 100 days, Lontoc also said that, \"Within 100 days, we will restore the MRT and LRT to 2010 level, where there are 20 trains running.\" Regarding long-term plans for the train systems, Lontoc stated that the main goal was to increase the passenger capacity of these trains. Today, the train lines are only able to serve 350,000 passengers each day\u2014a mere 3% of the over 12 million commutes made throughout Metro Manila daily. Over the next 3 years, Department of Transportation will work to procure more coaches, build extensions for LRT 1, LRT 2, and MRT 7, and invest heavily on infrastructure so as to serve a larger number of commuters across a wider range of areas. The Department is also in the process of deploying of cheap, safe, and well-maintained point-to-point buses, said Lontoc. The government hopes that by making these buses more comfortable and convenient \u2013 taking commuters from one location to another without any stops in between \u2013 more people will opt for public transport, reducing the number of cars on the road. Currently 25% of the people who take these buses have already made the shift from taking private vehicles, but the government intends to get that figure up to 50%. \"I\u2019ve tried it myself and it\u2019s very convenient,\" said Lontoc when asked about her experience on one of the new buses. \"It\u2019s so much cheaper than bringing a car, and they even have free wifi, so I could check email on the way to work.\" Though these buses only cover 5 routes now (Alabang-Makati, Robinsons-Makati, Trinoma-Makati, SM Megamall-SM North & SM North-Makati), the government plans on rolling out additional vehicles along more routes in August. According to Undersecretary Lontoc, the government will also work on modernizing public utility vehicles like the jeepney. Through government financing, jeepneys around Metro Manila will get their engines replaced with newer models that run on more eco-friendly fuels. \u2013 Paco Tantoco / Rappler.com Paco Tantoco is a Rappler intern.", "I\u2019ve been covering Donald Trump off and on for more than 25 years, and what has always struck me is his lack of impulse control. It was his biggest problem when I first started dealing with him in the 1980s, and it\u2019s his biggest problem now. Plenty of financial and real estate players got carried away in the go-go 1980s. But Trump was in a class by himself. He ended up presiding over six \u2014 count \u2019em, six \u2014 bankruptcies because he kept making business decisions with his gut rather than with his brain. Trump\u2019s less-than-stellar business history has been well documented by The Washington Post and other newspapers, magazines and online publications, as has his lack of self-control in his personal life. But what has not been fully explored is the impulsiveness \u2014 actually, total recklessness \u2014 that was at the root of the pivotal decisions that tanked his businesses.That same impulsiveness is at the root of Trump\u2019s self-inflicted political and business problems today. Impulse control is of only passing public concern when we\u2019re dealing with a business player, unless the player has amassed enough billions of debts or other obligations to threaten the stability of global financial markets. Trump wasn\u2019t remotely that big a hitter in the \u201980s and \u201990s, and certainly isn\u2019t now, his boasts and preening notwithstanding. But public concern about self-control is very relevant for a president of the United States. Whether we\u2019re talking about the Bay of Pigs (when John F. Kennedy resisted the hawkish instincts of his advisers who wanted to escalate) or the bugging of Democratic headquarters (which Richard Nixon could not resist) or the invasion of Iraq (need I say more?), presidents are bombarded with chances to over\u00adreact, and their over\u00adreactions can have catastrophic consequences for our country and the world. Looking back, you can see how out of control Trump was during his early days, as an heir to a family fortune built on low-profile real estate who was determined to become a star. He grabbed two casinos in Atlantic City in the 1980s because he could, using tons of borrowed money. He bought these casinos knowing that a new, bigger and glitzier casino, the Taj Mahal, was underway and would cannibalize the casinos that he was buying. So what did he do? He compounded his problems by grabbing the Taj and financing its over-the-top opulence with $675 million of junk bonds that carried a 14 percent interest rate. The Taj did, in fact, cannibalize the Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casinos, as well as their Atlantic City competitors. But although the Trump Taj Mahal drew good crowds, it couldn\u2019t begin to earn enough profit to cover its bond interest. Ultimately, the Taj and Trump\u2019s two other casinos each filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That made Trump what bankruptcy types would call a 33. You know, three times 11. The bankruptcy of New York\u2019s Plaza Hotel, a trophy property that Trump bought at an absurdly high price with borrowed money, made him a 44. Trump boasted about the purchase in newspaper ads. But his Plaza preening didn\u2019t help the hotel pay its bills. Trump impulsively grabbed two other high-profile properties: the world\u2019s biggest yacht, which he renamed the Trump Princess; and Eastern Airlines\u2019 Boston-New York-Washington shuttle, which became the Trump Shuttle. These, too, were paid for with borrowed money, some of which Trump personally guaranteed, an act of incredible recklessness. Trump said publicly that he hadn\u2019t personally guaranteed any of his borrowings \u2014 but that was a lie, one of many that he has uttered during his business and political careers. The yacht and the shuttle were taken over by Trump\u2019s creditors and unloaded for vastly less than he paid. That was simpler and better for everyone than two more Trump bankruptcies. Because I specialize in writing about financial excesses and am used to dealing with people who engage in fantasy finance, I realized fairly early in the game that Trump\u2019s real estate and casino empire was doomed. And I figured that because he had idiotically issued personal guarantees on more than $800 million of his $3.3 billion of debt, he was headed for personal bankruptcy. Personally guaranteeing properties\u2019 debts puts everything you own at risk. Savvy, in-control developers don\u2019t do that. Reckless and desperate ones do. So on June 17, 1990, my column, \"The Party\u2019s Over for Trump,\" ran on the front page of my then-employer, the now-defunct New York Newsday newspaper. \"Trump,\" I wrote, \"is on his way down \u2014 and probably out.\" I was right about the \"down\" part but not about the \"out\" part. Much to my surprise, Trump managed to escape the financial wreckage that he created without having to declare personal bankruptcy. That\u2019s partly because he got expert advice from Stephen Bollenbach, a big-time guy whom he had the sense to hire to negotiate with his creditors. Another reason was that some of Trump\u2019s biggest creditors had their own financial problems and didn\u2019t want to engage in messy public disputes with a master media manipulator like Trump. And, to be fair, a major reason Trump didn\u2019t end up in personal bankruptcy was his own negotiating skills \u2014 which are considerable. It was an amazing recovery, and Trump deserves full credit (no pun intended) for pulling it off. He lost major properties and was put on a humiliating (for him) monthly allowance by his creditors. But he walked away from the wreckage rather than having to be carried out. Trump emerged with a majority stake in his three post-bankrupt casinos, which conferred tax advantages on the properties, and allowed them to continue using his name. In 1995, he got a bonus from his casino stake: He persuaded the investing public (talk about suckers!) to fork over $140 million for stock in a publicly traded company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, whose ticker symbol was DJT. As in Donald John Trump. The company bearing Trump\u2019s initials bought Trump\u2019s casinos at high prices. That helped DJT the person shed financial obligations but saddled DJT the company with debt that it couldn\u2019t pay. The company went bankrupt in 2004, and its successor went broke in 2009. That made Trump one of the few \u2014 if not the only \u2014 Chapter 66 guys in public life. The company went broke for a third time in 2014, but by then, Trump had only a 10 percent stake. So he\u2019s Donald 66 Trump rather than Donald 77. Public investors in DJT stock were wiped out. After his 1990 crash, Trump stopped gambling huge amounts of borrowed money to build properties. I don\u2019t know if it was self-control, fear or an inability to borrow. In any event, it served him well. I was impressed at how Trump transformed himself from a high-wire borrowing act into a licensor: someone who gets businesses to pay him fees for the right to use his name. Getting money rolling in the door without taking risks is a very nice business. I figured Trump would do the sensible and intelligent thing \u2014 be happy as a rehabilitated, very rich person (though nowhere as rich as he claims to be), feel relieved that he had escaped total disaster and not go looking for more trouble. I thought he had learned his lesson. What I didn\u2019t realize \u2014 until The Post asked me to help with its Trump coverage when he launched his presidential campaign a year ago \u2014 is that although Trump managed not to impulsively borrow huge amounts of money to overpay for things, he was still unable, or perhaps unwilling, to rein in his impulses. Lack of impulse control has enormously benefited his presidential campaign. It distinguished him among the 17 initial Republican candidates, allowed him to dominate cable TV news and got him massive coverage in other media as well. There\u2019s a lot to be said for being blunt \u2014 but Trump routinely journeys from blunt into ranting, which helped him in the Republican primaries but could pose major political and business dangers for him in the general election. I suspect that one reason he comes up short on impulse control involves his 14 seasons on \"The Apprentice.\" That\u2019s the reality TV show that General Electric\u2019s then-chief executive Jack Welch and one of his top lieutenants, Bob Wright, bestowed on Trump after he did an impressive job converting New York\u2019s financially distressed Gulf and Western Building (on which GE\u2019s pension trust held a mortgage) into the Trump International Hotel and Tower. \"The Apprentice\" was a pivotal event for Trump. It made him into a truly national figure, and he says the show paid him more than $200 million during its run. The crazier Trump acted on \"The Apprentice,\" the more he carried on and humiliated people and declared \"you\u2019re fired,\" the better TV it was. So whatever instincts he might have had to develop self-control were vitiated by \"The Apprentice.\" But there\u2019s a downside \u2014 a huge one \u2014 to his behavior, and it\u2019s starting to become apparent now. He\u2019s incredibly reckless. He seems to sometimes license his name to questionable enterprises, without doing much (if any) research into them. He makes enemies he doesn\u2019t have to make because he baits people and institutions that don\u2019t bow down to him, and he reacts badly when organizations such as The Post (which he has banned from his campaign events) challenge him by asking perfectly reasonable questions. He put his name on Trump University, which systematically victimized middle-class and lower-middle-class people, according to an investigation by the New York attorney general and an ongoing class-action suit in California. Those are the kind of people who are perceived to be his core constituency. I wonder how many middle and lower-middle types had no idea about what Trump U was up to until recently and didn\u2019t know how Trump has stiffed all sorts of contractors over the years, resulting in lots of blue-collar workers losing their jobs. I wonder whether this knowledge will erode the faith of some Trump fans. Do you think the public would be paying much attention to Trump U\u2019s travails if it weren\u2019t for Trump\u2019s political profile? Trump, of course, compounded the problem by gratuitously attacking the ethnic background of the judge who dared to rule against him. Do you think people would be clamoring to see Trump\u2019s tax returns, which presidential candidates for 40 years have disclosed, if he weren\u2019t about to become the Republican nominee? A return that Trump, in a typical switcheroo, first said he would be willing to disclose but now says he won\u2019t produce because no one cares. Well, I care, and so should you. There are at least two obvious reasons and a third reason that\u2019s not obvious to anyone but real estate types and tax techies. First, we ought to see whether Trump\u2019s income, holdings and taxes incurred (if any) are consistent with his claim of having a net worth in excess of $10 billion. Second, we ought to see his charitable contributions, which he claims are \"generous.\" The third \u2014 and not obvious \u2014 reason involves something called Section 469 of the U.S. tax code. Rental real estate, a Trump specialty, typically throws off tax losses\u00ad for its owners. But Section 469 forbids taxpayers from using these losses to offset other income unless more than half their business activities (at least 750 hours a year) involve developing or managing real estate. Not licensing their name to golf courses or making speeches\u00ad or being on TV reality shows. We ought to see if Trump has used Section 469 to shelter income in past years. And especially last year, when he was running for president. Trump could clear all of this up in a heartbeat by voluntarily releasing his tax returns. Doing so would minimize what is likely to be considerable damage if his tax returns somehow get leaked. But that would require Trump to control his impulses and reverse his position, something he rarely does. Trump had been presenting himself as a really generous guy. But his self-proclaimed image as a generous donor to worthy causes has been shredded by groundbreaking articles that my Post colleagues have written. None of this would be happening to Trump if he had just kept his mouth largely shut and his head down instead of trying to become president by spewing falsehoods and insults, exposing himself to all sorts of risks he didn\u2019t have to take. One needless risk that he\u2019s taken involves praising the late, unlamented Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for supposedly keeping terrorism in check. But now that Trump has brought Hussein into the campaign, I\u2019m struck by similarities between them: Both made remarkable comebacks, and both have (or in Hussein\u2019s case, had) impulse control problems. Hussein amazingly managed to remain in power despite losing the 1991 Gulf War to the United States and its allies, who threw him out of Kuwait and inflicted immense losses on his military. It looked like Hussein was absolutely finished. But he emerged from the Gulf War in control of Iraq, managed to slaughter his internal opponents and ended up presiding over a country that had the world\u2019s fourth-largest army. But instead of being satisfied with that, Hussein couldn\u2019t resisting trying to be a major player on the world scene. So he led people to believe that he was developing weapons of mass destruction. The WMDs didn\u2019t exist, as we now know \u2014 but lots of people thought they did. That led to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the destruction of Hussein. No, I\u2019m not accusing Trump of being a dictator wannabe. Just pointing out the striking similarities. Trump is going to pay a serious price in image and money if he doesn\u2019t win the presidency \u2014 and maybe even if he does. His various rants have cost him sponsorships, led some organizations to shun his enterprises and have focused attention on things such as the Trump University litigation that hadn\u2019t previously attracted mass attention. In addition, his campaign has prompted numerous organizations and people to tell the true story of Trump as a businessman, and how he\u2019s made up numbers and spewed exaggerations, lies and nonsense. That\u2019s totally at odds with the way Trump has portrayed himself for decades. Until a year ago, Trump\u2019s lack of impulse control was amusing (except to some of his targets) but didn\u2019t really matter to the country at large. Now, with him having a significant chance to become the leader of the world\u2019s foremost country, it matters a lot. Maybe Trump can learn to control his impulses \u2014 but there\u2019s no sign that he has. And, unfortunately, there\u2019s no sign that he will.

We've all been there before: You spend what seems like hours trying to fall asleep, tossing and turning and growing increasingly frustrated. You look at the clock and realize it's three in the morning, meaning you only have a few more hours to sleep before it's time to get up to go to work. No matter what you do, you just can't seem to get yourself to the point of relaxation you need. It might be the worst feeling in the world. If that sounds familiar to you, don't fret: We've got some interesting ways to get yourself relaxed and ready for sleep, so you never have to go through that scenario again. From tongue techniques to deep stretching to intense deep breathing exercises, this is how you prepare your body and mind for a full night of uninterrupted, gloriously refreshing sleep. Try them tonight -- and don't forget to thank us tomorrow. In the beginning, it's important to get your mind into a slower place. Focus your mind and body on taking slow, deep breaths. This will help reduce your heart rate and blood pressure. When you deep breathe, what's really going on? Deep breathing also allows the parasympathetic system (which is responsible for your ability to relax) to override your sympathetic system (which controls your automatic stress response). Then you could always try the 4-7-8 technique. According to Dr. Andrew Weil, you should sit up in bed with your back straight, and press the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth right behind your front teeth. Maintaining that position, close your mouth and inhale through your nose for four counts, hold that breath for seven counts, and then exhale through your mouth around your tongue for eight counts. Repeat this pattern until you have completed four full breaths. Engaging your tongue in the process is actually pretty important. Read this set of instructions carefully and try it for yourself.", "During the development of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles. One of which was the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon-fiber reinforced plastics and other composite materials instead of the aluminum most commonly used on commercial airliners. While the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge, it's a decision that allowed Boeing to make a major change to its aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on its passengers. \"The Dreamliner has a composite fuselage and that allowed us to pressurize it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not as susceptible to fatigue,\" Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Business Insider in an interview. Currently, most airliners have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 feet. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 feet. \"To lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin,\" Emery added. \"It's a bit counterintuitive for most people.\" Why does air pressure matter to passengers?\u200b For most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness. All of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag. But the reality is that jet lag is far more serious. The very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6,500 feet. In a study conducted by Oklahoma State University with the help of Boeing, researchers wrote: \"Some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterized by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. The symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. However, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness.\" In 2015 Boeing annouced it had made the lightest metal ever The study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8,000 feet of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. Although this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called \"increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours\" of exposure. \"The research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6,000 feet similar to that at sea level,\" Emery said. \"So we decided to pressurize the Dreamliner at 6,000 feet.\" At 6,000 feet, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself. According to Emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation between altitude and jet lag, Boeing has taken additional measures to mitigate the symptoms. These measures include an increase in cabin humidity as well as a new air-filtration system. Why haven't we had this all along? The Dreamliner won't be the only Boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude. The company's upcoming 777X wide-body mini-jumbo jet will also be pressurized at 6,000 feet. However, unlike the composite Dreamliner, the 777X, Boeing's successor to landmark 777, will be primarily made of aluminum. \"Aluminum aircraft can be pressurized to 6,000 feet,\" Kent Craver, Boeing Commercial Airplanes regional director of passenger satisfaction, told Business Insider in an interview. \"In fact, most business jets are already pressurized to that level.\" In addition, Airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on its next generation of airliners. Airplane makers have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin puts greater stress on aluminum airframes. This increases the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the airplane. However, Boeing believes it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777X without going to a composite body. \"We know the 777 fuselage, its structural qualities, and its fatigue margins really well,\" a Boeing spokesperson told us in an email. \"We also understand the requirements of the lower cabin altitude in terms of cycles and pressures on the fuselage. As a result, we can achieve it with a few local reinforcements and change those loads out to accommodate lower cabin altitude.\" The Boeing 777X is set to enter service in 2019.", "State of the Union liveblog: The conversation POLITICO\u2019s rolling coverage of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2015 State of the Union address.

Obama is signaling that he\u2019ll fight back \u2014 if nothing else, to convince Democrats that he\u2019s still on the case and hasn\u2019t given up on climate change. 9:51 p.m. THREE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ABSENT \u2014 Just two-thirds of the Supreme Court is present at the State of the Union address, Time reports. Conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia are not in the House chamber for the president\u2019s speech. Scalia hasn\u2019t gone for more than a decade, while Thomas has decried the event as \"so partisan.\" In 2010, after Obama criticized the court\u2019s Citizens United decision, cameras caught Alito mouthing \"not true.\" 9:48 p.m. OBAMA ON CUBA \u2014 \"When what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t work for fifty years, it\u2019s time to try something new. ... And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.\" 9:46 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 6: OBAMA CALLS FOR AUMF AGAINST ISIL \u2014 What he said: \"Tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\" What he meant: \"Step up, McCain.\" Obama is taking plenty of heat from Republican critics like John McCain, his former 2008 rival, and Lindsey Graham for not taking tough enough actions to stop the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorist group. He\u2019s also faced skepticism from other lawmakers, including Democrats, who say they can\u2019t get consistent answers on what the administration\u2019s goals are. So by asking Congress to give him formal authorization for military action, he\u2019s basically trying to force his critics to share ownership of the issue and spell out what kinds of military actions they\u2019re willing to support \u2014 including whether they would back the possible use of ground troops. 9:44 p.m. PARIS ATTACK TALK: Lawmakers, including Rep. Gwen Moore of Oklahoma, hold up yellow pencils when Obama brings up the attack in Paris. 9:42 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 5 \u2014 What he said: \"Look, I\u2019m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven\u2019t always lived up to the hype.\" What he meant: \"I hear you, Rosa DeLauro.\" The speech made clear that Obama will try to get Congress to approve fast-track trade authority \u2014 one of the few areas where he and congressional Republicans actually share the same interests. But he has to nod to the concerns of liberal Democrats \u2014 including DeLauro, a House Democrat from Connecticut who opposes the trade deals the administration is brokering \u2014 that the agreements won\u2019t include enough environmental and labor protections. The bottom line, Obama said, is that \"95 percent of the world\u2019s customers live outside our borders, and we can\u2019t close ourselves off from those opportunities.\" 9:39 p.m. THE ISSUE OBAMA AND CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS AGREE ON \u2014 First time Rs give Obama a standing ovation and Dems don't - 33 minutes into speech, calling for Trade Promotion Authority \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) January 21, 2015 9:37 p.m. OBAMA ON KEYSTONE \u2014 \"So let\u2019s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.\" David Nather, on what he meant: \"You\u2019re not getting Keystone.\" Obama has already threatened to veto legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline, infuriating Republicans who have put its approval at the top of their energy agenda. Rather than touch off that fight again, Obama opted for the \"let\u2019s set our sights higher\" construction \u2014 but there\u2019s no mystery about the signal he\u2019s trying to send. 9:34 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 4 \u2014 What he said: \"Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.\" What he meant: \"Seriously, Tennessee is a red state and they\u2019re doing this.\" Obama wants to make the most out of the fact that his community college proposal \u2014 which would make the first two years tuition-free for many students \u2014 is modeled on a program launched by Republican Gov. Bill Haslam. But other Republicans, including Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, say they don\u2019t want to expand it into a federal program; they\u2019d rather let the states make their own choices. 9:33 p.m. RBG ASLEEP \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Manu Raju reports that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seated in the House chamber, is asleep. 9:29 p.m. BIG DEM APPLAUSE LINE: MINIMUM WAGE \u2014 A big play to the Democratic base with this appeal on the minimum wage. \"And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it,\" he said, to a standing ovation and hoots from Democrats. \"If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.\" 9:28 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 3 \u2014 What he said: \"So I\u2019ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let\u2019s put it to a vote right here in Washington.\" What he meant: \"Maybe the states will listen to me.\" White House advisers know there\u2019s not a big chance that a Republican Congress will pass his agenda, but they believe there will be chances to prod states into action \u2014 and paid leave is one of the issues where they think they can shape the debate. And if congressional Republicans vote against issues like paid leave, the advisers believe, they\u2019re just hurting themselves. \u2014 David Nather 9:23 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 2 \u2014 What he said: \"So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don\u2019t get in the way.\" What he meant: \"Did I mention I\u2019m at 50 percent?\" Obama is basking in the best run of economic news he\u2019s had in a long time, all of which have boosted his approval rating to the highest level since spring 2013, according to the latest ABC News-Washington Post poll. His message to Republicans: Don\u2019t assume the public hates my economic ideas \u2013 including my latest package of tax hikes on the wealthy \u2014 as much as you do. 9:22 p.m. OBAMA AD LIB \u2014 Twelve minutes in, and this reporter thinks Obama appears to be in a confident mood. It\u2019s all over his face. After a laundry list of ways that the U.S. has improved under his watch \u2014 job creation, lowered fuel costs, better education results \u2014 Obama moves away from his prepared remarks for a moment. \"This is good news, people!\" he says to laughter, offering a wink and a smile. 9:16 p.m. WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE MEANT, PT. 1, courtesy of the great David Nather \u2014 What he said: \"Tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.\" What he meant: \"Tonight, I want to talk about 2016.\" Obama has already promised Democrats he\u2019s going to \"play offense\" against Republicans over the next two years, vetoing legislation and fighting against efforts to dismantle his agenda. It\u2019s all part of an effort Democratic political strategists believe will be necessary heading into the 2016 elections: frame the big policy choices against the GOP \u2014 and set up the fights that will carry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s likely campaign for the White House. 9:14 p.m. \u2018THE STATE OF THE UNION IS STRONG\u2019 \u2014 \"The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong,\" the president says. \"At this moment \u2014 with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production \u2014 we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.\" 9:11 p.m. OBAMA HAILS \u2018BREAKTHROUGH YEAR FOR AMERICA\u2019 \u2014 \"Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999,\" the president says, to big applause in the chamber. 9:10 p.m. POTUS TAKES THE PODIUM \u2014 After shaking hands with Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner, the Republican leader introduces the president. Obama begins his speech and we are officially underway. 9:06 p.m. POTUS ENTERS THE CHAMBER \u2014 President Barack Obama entered the chamber wearing a dark suit and gray tie. Walking behind him are congressional leaders House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Handshake and pat on the arm for Secretary of State John Kerry and a big hug for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 9:04 p.m. POTUS not yet in the chamber. 9:01 p.m. IDLE CHATTER \u2014 As lawmakers wait for the president, video catches conversations between: \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel \u2014 Democratic Reps. Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington, D.C. and Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri \u2014 Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Al Franken of Minnesota (sharing a laugh) 8:56 p.m. MINIMAL MIXED SEATING \u2014 Some Democrats and Republicans are seated next to each other, but not many, POLITICO\u2019s Manu Raju reports. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is sitting next to Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is seated in between Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is in between Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) 8:50 p.m. #SOTU UP TO 452 TWEETS PER MINUTE \u2014 Wow. 8:45 p.m. ERNST\u2019S CAMO SHOES \u2014 POLITICO congressional reporter Seung Min Kim plays fashion reporter for a night and gets a shot of the camouflage shoes of Iowa Sen.

POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett reported earlier this afternoon that the Nevada Democrat was unlikely to attend the speech. Reid returned to his Senate office today for the first time following injuries he sustained while exercising earlier this month, including fractured ribs and bones in his face. 8:35 p.m. SITTING COURTSIDE \u2014 Members of Congress often vie for the aisle seats in the House chamber, within speaking and handshake distance when the president enters. According to POLITICO\u2019s Jake Sherman, here\u2019s a partial list of lawmakers who snagged a prized aisle seat: Reps. Billy Long of Missouri, Rep. Barbara Lee of California, Mark Takano of California, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and, of course, Eliot Engel of New York. 8:30 p.m. KING CLARIFIES \u2018DEPORTABLE\u2019 COMMENT \u2014 Rep. Steve King tried to make a joke out of the comment he made about a guest invited to the State of the Union by President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. \"The futility of language emerges on Twitter,\" the Iowa Republican said. He then tried to channel pop star Taylor Swift, telling reporters to \"Shake it off.\" When pressed further, King blamed Obama and said the controversy would have no impact on the Iowa Freedom Summit, his 2016 presidential hopeful gathering in Des Moines this weekend. \"Why isn\u2019t the president taking heat for what he\u2019s doing to the rule of law?\" asked an unrepentant King. \"He\u2019s going to make another promise that he\u2019s going to violate the Constitution tonight. At least one.\" King, perhaps Congress\u2019 fiercest and most outspoken critic on immigration, harshly criticized the president and first lady on Twitter for inviting a DREAM-er to sit in the first lady\u2019s box. \u2014 John Bresnahan 8:25 p.m. PHOTO: MARTHA RADDATZ AND PAUL RYAN \u2014 The ABC News correspondent and Wisconsin Republican share a photo years after Raddatz\u2019s moderation of 2012 vice-presidential debate between Ryan and Joe Biden.

The White House selected Foxx as the cabinet member who won\u2019t appear at the speech in case a catastrophic event befalls the nation\u2019s legislative and executive branches, according to USA Today. Foxx, normally 13th in line for the presidency, would assume the nation\u2019s highest office and provide continuity of government if such a tragedy struck. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz was last year\u2019s designated survivor. \u2014 Kevin Robillard 7:50 p.m. #SOTU: MORE THAN A TWEET PER SECOND \u2014 A couple hours before the speech, there were about 80-130 tweets per minute using the official #SOTU hashtag, according to POLITICO\u2019s Andrea Bitely. 7:40 p.m. 2016 GOVERNORS WEIGH IN \u2014 Capitol Hill and President Barack Obama are in the spotlight tonight, but at least two GOP presidential hopefuls don\u2019t want to be left out. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 two governors weighing running for the Republican nomination in 2016 \u2014 took to Twitter to criticize Obama ahead of his speech. \"I\u2019ll save you 45 mins. Obama will decry Republicans, beat up on private business and argue for more \u2018free stuff\u2019. Your welcome,\" Jindal wrote. (While his timing estimate is pretty close to our reported 50-minute estimate, he might have been better served by going with \"You\u2019re.\") Walker also took a shot at the president on Twitter. \"President seems to measure success by how many people are dependent on the govt,\" he wrote. \"We should measure success by just the opposite.\" 7:35 p.m. PHOTO: ALAN AND JUDY GROSS \u2014 Alan Gross, the USAID subcontractor who was reunited with his family last month after being imprisoned in Cuba for five years, appears in a pre-SOTU photo with his wife Judy.

In a video released hours before Obama\u2019s speech, the Ohio Republican obliquely criticized the president for pursuing big-government policies. \"Tonight isn\u2019t about the president\u2019s legacy,\" Boehner, dressed in a shirt and tie, says in the video, looking straight at the camera. \"It\u2019s about the people\u2019s priorities. Making government bigger isn\u2019t going to help the middle class. More growth and more opportunity will help the middle class, and those are the Republican priorities.\" 7:20 p.m. POLL: 42 PERCENT SAY STATE OF THE NATION IS STRONG \u2014 Forty-two percent of Americans believe the U.S. is in good or excellent shape, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released hours before tonight\u2019s speech. That\u2019s compared with 57 percent who say the state of the nation is not so good or poor. Still, the survey offered some good news for the president as he nears his address to the nation. A plurality of Americans \u2014 42 percent \u2014 believe his policies have helped the economy, while 27 percent said they slowed economic development. And a quarter of Americans say their financial situation has improved since Obama took office, the best number of his presidency. 7:10 p.m. ERNST EXCERPTS RELEASED \u2014 Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) will declare that the new Republican majority in Congress is \"back to work\" for Americans, stressing that the era of \"political talking points\" is over in the official GOP response to President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union. In excerpts released in advance of Obama\u2019s speech, Ernst will ask to have a \"conversation\" with viewers, pledging that lawmakers in Washington are \"ready to make Washington focus on your concerns again.\" \"We heard the message you sent in November \u2014 loud and clear,\" Ernst will say, a reference to the decisive GOP victories last fall. \"And now we\u2019re getting to work to change the direction Washington has been taking our country.\" The message Ernst plans to send on behalf of the Republican Party is a clear attempt to showcase a GOP that is ready to shift the focus away from a gridlocked Washington that Ernst said held the \"same stale mindset\" that led to policies such as Obama\u2019s health care law. Ernst will strike a tone of cooperation between the Obama White House and Republicans who dominate the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, citing trade and tax reform as two potential areas for a bipartisan compromise. To see the full excerpts released for Ernst\u2019s speech, go here. \u2014 Seung Min Kim 7:00 p.m. KING RAILS AGAINST FLOTUS SOTU GUEST \u2014 Rep. Steve King, perhaps Congress\u2019s fiercest and most outspoken critic on immigration, harshly criticized the president and first lady for inviting a DREAM-er to sit in the first lady\u2019s box. \"Obama perverts \u2018prosecutorial discretion\u2019 by inviting a deportable to sit in place of honor at #SOTU w/1st Lady. I should sit with Alito,\" the Iowa Republican wrote on Twitter, in reference to Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, part of the court\u2019s conservative wing. Ana Zamora will sit with first lady Michelle Obama in her box this evening. She moved from Mexico when she was a year old, and has expressed gratitude to the president for his 2012 executive order that has allowed her to stay in the U.S. 6:50 p.m. 42 LAWMAKERS TO PAY TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE HEBDO \u2014 Forty-two Democratic lawmakers will pay tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre during tonight\u2019s speech, a spokesman for Rep. Gwen Moore told POLITICO. Moore, a Wisconsin Democrat, planned to lead a group of lawmakers in holding up a yellow pencil during applause breaks when the president mentions the terrorist attacks on the French satirical newspaper. The yellow pencil has become an international symbol for freedom of expression and the press following the attacks. According to Moore spokesman Eric Harris, the lawmakers are: Gwen Moore, Keith Ellison, Barbara Lee, Marcia Fudge, Karen Bass, Charlie Rangel, Janice Hahn, John Conyers, Jim McGovern, Mark Pocan, Joe Courtney, Ruben Gallego, Bobby Rush, Matt Cartwright, Steve Cohen, Bill Foster, Mark Takano, Raul Grijalva, Jackie Speier, Gene Green, Mark DeSaulnier, Rosa DeLauro, Nita Lowey, Doris Matsui, Derek Kilmer, Sander Levin, Eliot Engel, David Cicilline, Loretta Sanchez, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Alan Grayson, Grace Napolitano, Juan Vargas, Donald Payne Jr., Kyrsten Sinema, Alan Lowenthal, Dina Titus, Joaquin Castro, Jim Langevin, Marc Veasey, Chris Van Hollen, John Garamendi, Sam Farr, Debbie Dingell, Michelle Lujan Grisham, Suzan DelBene. Harris added that the list is \"growing by the minute.\" 6:30 p.m. SPEECH EXCERPTS RELEASED \u2014 President Barack Obama will use his State of the Union address Tuesday to convey his continued dedication to \"middle-class economics\" and to call for \"a smarter kind of American leadership abroad,\" according to excerpts of his speech provided by the White House. \"The verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don\u2019t get in the way,\" Obama will say. He also will discuss his desire for smart foreign policy around the world and call on Congress to pass a resolution authorizing military action against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. For a link to the full excerpts released by the White House, go here. \u2014 Jennifer Epstein 6:20 p.m. CAPITOL POLICE: OBAMA WILL BE DONE BY 9:50 PM \u2014U.S. Capitol Police are telling officers that they anticipate President Barack Obama will finish his State of the Union address by 9:50 p.m., POLITICO\u2019s John Bresnahan reports. A 50-minute speech would be the president\u2019s shortest-ever State of the Union address: As we noted earlier, Mark Knoller of CBS News reported that Obama\u2019s shortest speech to a joint session of Congress lasted one hour. 6:15 p.m. WHAT DOES SOTU MEAN FOR CONGRESS? In a new video, POLITICO senior congressional reporter Manu Raju previews tonight\u2019s speech and what it means for lawmakers on the Hill. 5:45 p.m. SCOTT: OBAMA EMBRACING \u2018FAILED\u2019 POLICIES \u2014 Add Florida Gov. Rick Scott to the list of Republicans slamming President Barack Obama even before his State of the Union address gets underway. The Republican governor \u2014 who narrowly won reelection against Democrat Charlie Crist in one of the nastiest races in the 2014 cycle \u2014 took aim at Obama\u2019s proposal that seeks to lower taxes for the middle class while raising the top capital gains rate and closing loopholes for wealthy individuals. \"The massive tax increases proposed by the President reflect his commitment to the failed, liberal policies that were roundly rebuked by the American people in November,\" Scott said in a statement released in advance of tonight\u2019s speech. In recent days and weeks, the White House has changed its tactics by aggressively marketing their policy proposals ahead of the State of the Union, both to generate buzz and gather momentum. Scott\u2019s statement is yet another indication, though, that the policy rollout is also allowing Republicans to go on the attack early, as well. 5:15 p.m. A stunning photo from POLITICO photographer M. Scott Mahaskey of National Statuary Hall beginning to come alive. The hall just outside the House chamber is a major hub for television camera crews every year before the State of the Union address. Statuary Hall takes shape as a multi-crew television studio as crews setup for the #SOTU Jan. 20, 2015 at the US Capitol in Washington, DC. (M. Scott Mahaskey/Politico) ? A photo posted by POLITICO (@politico) on Jan 20, 2015 at 2:00pm PST 5:00 p.m. DON\u2019T YOU HAVE WORK TO DO? \u2014 Several members of Congress have already shown up to reserve seats in the Chamber hours ahead of President Barack Obama\u2019s speech \u2014 despite an explicit message from House Speaker John Boehner not to do so. \"As has been the practice in the past, members will not be allowed to reserve seats prior to the joint session by placement of placards or personal items,\" the speaker\u2019s office wrote in an email earlier today. \"Chamber Security may remove these items from the seats.\" But some lawmakers \u2014 most notably perennial early-arriver Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), who arrived at 8:30 a.m., according to CNN \u2014 have already arrived to reserve seats along the aisle to get a fist-bump or quick chat from the president as he enters the chamber. Other lawmakers who have reserved seats, include Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, Marcia Fudge of Ohio, Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Steve Cohen of Tennessee, according to CNN. 4:25 p.m. TEA PARTY LEADER: \u2018TWO TEA PARTY RESPONSES\u2019 TONIGHT: The head of the Tea Party Express, the group responsible for the tea party response to the State of the Union, says the conservative movement will have two responses tonight \u2014 Curt Clawson ... and Joni Ernst. \"Sen. Ernst earned the support of Tea Party Express in the primary and was able to coalesce tea party members and activists across the state of Iowa because of her message and her values that are representative of the larger tea party movement. ... So, in that vein, I would say there\u2019s going to be two tea party responses,\" Tea Party Express Executive Director Taylor Budowich said in a phone interview with POLITICO. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, of course, will be delivering the official Republican response tonight, while Florida Rep. Curt Clawson of Florida will deliver the tea party one. But Tea Party Express endorsed Ernst when she ran to the right of the field in the 2014 Republican primary, and the new senator has significant support from grassroots conservatives. Budowich dismissed concerns about whether the annual tradition was deepening rifts between the conservative and establishment wings of the GOP, predicting that Clawson and Ernst\u2019s speeches would be \"complementary.\" He argued that a tea party response is still helpful in 2015, even though he estimated that there is 95 percent overlap between the official Republican Party platform and that of the tea party. Tea Party Express has hosted an official tea party response to the State of the Union since 2011. When asked how many more years his organization would feel compelled to offer its own, separate response to the State of the Union, Budowich they plan to stop in 2017 \u2014 because the president will be a member of the tea party, naturally. 4:05 p.m. BIDEN TO CALIFORNIA \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden will visit southern California later this week, the White House announced today. On Friday, Biden will address West Los Angeles College to discuss higher education. Earlier this month, the White House unveiled a plan to make two years of community college free for all students, a proposal the president will likely discuss this evening. The vice president will also speak at the Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summit in Irvine on Saturday. Other speakers at the summit include former President Bill Clinton, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.) 4:00 p.m. REID ANNOUNCES THREE GUESTS \u2014 A young woman who benefited from President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration orders will be Harry Reid\u2019s guest at the State of the Union. The Senate minority leader, who is up for reelection next year in Nevada, has invited Blanca Gamez to sit in the balcony during the president\u2019s speech tonight. Reid is counting on historic Hispanic turnout in the southern part of the state to win what could be a very tough campaign. An afternoon release from Reid\u2019s office notes that Gamez was born in Sonora, Mexico, and came to the United States when she was seven months old. Reid\u2019s office said Gamez \"was able to benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that President Obama announced in 2012 ... Now, because of President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration in November 2014, Blanca\u2019s mom is able to apply for Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA).\" Gamez is currently applying for law school and working for a local nonprofit called ProgressNow Nevada. \u2014 James Hohmann 3:50 p.m. PORTMAN FUNDRAISING OFF SOTU FOR SENATE RUN \u2014 Sen. Rob Portman is soliciting donations for his upcoming Senate run by criticizing the president ahead of tonight\u2019s address. The Ohio Republican \u2014 who last month announced he would not run for president and would instead seek reelection to the Senate \u2014 sent a fundraising email to supporters this afternoon. \"In past State of the Union addresses, the President has repeatedly touted ineffective policies and made promises to the American people that he could not keep,\" Portman writes in the email. \"I don\u2019t know about you, but I am fed up with the failures of the Obama administration and think it\u2019s time we take a stand.\" The email then links to a donation page for his 2016 campaign. The NRCC also sent a fundraising note to supporters earlier in the day based on Obama\u2019s State of the Union address. Portman, who was first elected to the Senate in 2010, co-chaired the NRSC in 2014. 3:45 p.m. LAWMAKERS TO OFFER CHARLIE HEBDO TRIBUTE \u2014 Rep. Gwen Moore will lead a group of lawmakers in a tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, her office said today. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Democrat said that the congresswoman \u2014 along with other lawmakers \u2014 will hold up a yellow pencil during applause breaks when the president mentions the terrorist attacks on the French satirical newspaper. The yellow pencil has become an international symbol for freedom of expression and the press following the attacks. \"The congresswoman believes that this is unique opportunity to join our global partners in showing our collective support and solidarity,\" Moore press secretary Eric Harris said in a statement. Harris noted that Moore, who suffered two broken feet and a broken arm after she fell over the holidays, will be in a wheelchair for the speech. 3:00 p.m. NRCC FUNDRAISING OFF SOTU \u2014 The National Republican Congressional Committee is setting a fundraising target for tonight at 9 p.m., the time of the president\u2019s State of the Union address. The NRCC sent out an email this afternoon from Republican strategist and former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove slamming Obama for executive overreach. \"President Obama will double down on his go-it-alone strategy in tonight\u2019s State of the Union address,\" Rove\u2019s email says. The NRCC is hoping to reach its target of 1,000 membership renewals by the time Obama addresses the joint session of Congress tonight. 2:45 p.m. WARREN BACKS OBAMA TAX PLAN \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren today offered her support for the White House middle-class tax plan that the president will detail in his speech. The Massachusetts senator, a favorite in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, offered praise on Twitter for the plan that would raise taxes on the wealthy by raising the top capital gains rate and closing certain loopholes. \"The game is rigged when people pay higher taxes working for money than inheriting it,\" she wrote. \"I support @barackobama\u2019s plan.\" Obama\u2019s proposal will face long odds in the Republican-dominated House and Senate. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin have already signaled their objection to the proposal. Warren\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 1:20 p.m. RAND WOULD LIKE A WORD \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) will offer his own response to the State of the Union on Tuesday night. The all-but-declared presidential candidate will go live with his speech at 10 p.m. Eastern, immediately following the president. Paul also plans to do a hit on Fox News with Megyn Kelly. Paul\u2019s response, which will stream on his YouTube page, will come at the same time as Iowa freshman Sen. Joni Ernst, who is delivering the official Republican response. The Kentuckian has offered several direct video responses to the State of the Union since taking office in 2011, including last year. \u2014 James Hohmann 1:20 p.m. RAND WOULD LIKE A WORD \u2014 Sen.

In a not-so-subtle bit of symbolism, both the president and some congressional Republicans are bringing guests to highlight their views on the issue. Alan Gross, the USAID subcontractor who was imprisoned for five years in Cuba, will join First lady Michelle Obama in her box tonight, along with his wife, Judy. The White House secured Gross\u2019s release as part of the agreement to normalize relations with Cuba. Republicans who objected to Obama\u2019s Cuba deal last month cheered Gross\u2019s return to the U.S. House Speaker John Boehner will host dissident and activist Jorge Luis Garci\u0301a Pe\u0301rez, who served 17 years as a political prisoner under the Castro regime. Pe\u0301rez, known as Antu\u0301nez, has spoken out against Obama for the deal, which he has said appeases the repressive actions of the Cuban regime. In The Wall Street Journal, a Boehner spokesman said the Ohio Republican\u2019s guests highlight \"victims of the continuing tyranny on Cuba.\" Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, will host Rosa Maria Paya Acevedo, an activist whose dissident father died in a 2012 car accident that the family believes was orchestrated by the Cuban regime. \"While I disagree with the president\u2019s new Cuba policy, I hope Rosa Mari\u0301a Paya\u0301\u2019s presence on Tuesday night will at least remind him that her father\u2019s murderers have not been brought to justice, and that the U.S. is now, in fact, sitting at the table with them,\" Rubio said in a statement. Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba, will host Marlene Alejandre Triana, whose father died when his plane was shot down by the Cuban Air Force in 1996. Ros-Lehtinen is holding a joint press conference with fellow Florida Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Curbelo, as well as Antu\u0301nez and his wife, at 4:30 p.m. today to discuss the White House Cuba policy. 12:15 p.m. REID BACK AT IT \u2014 Senate Minority Leader is back in his office today, following an injury he sustained last month while exercising. The Nevada Democrat broke bones in his face and four ribs, and told KNPR State of Nevada that he might permanently lose sight in his right eye.

People talked about terrorism twice as much as the next-highest subject in Facebook chatter about the State of the Union from Jan. 11-17. The rest of the top 10 topics: 2) Obamacare; 3) Immigration; 4) Jobs and the Economy; 5) Israel and Palestine; 6) Taxes; 7) Community College Funding; 8) The NSA; 9) ISIS; 10) Paid Sick Leave. Obama will likely address the U.S. military\u2019s air campaign in Syria and Iraq against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant targets, as well as the greater fight against global terrorism following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris earlier this month. 10:15 a.m. DEMPSEY TO MISS SOTU \u2014 Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey will not attend tonight\u2019s State of the Union address, the Pentagon announced. He is in Belgium attending NATO meetings. Vice Chairman Adm. Sandy Winnefeld will attend Obama\u2019s speech. 10:10 a.m. ERNST ALL SMILES \u2014 Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst doesn\u2019t seem too nervous as she prepares to deliver the Republican response to Obama\u2019s speech, in an image posted on House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s Twitter account. 10:00 a.m. GOP SENATORS RESPOND TO OBAMA COMMUNITY COLLEGE PLAN \u2014 Three Republican senators wrote an op-ed today advocating an alternative plan to the White House proposal to make two years of community college free for all students. Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Ben Sasse of Nebraska \u2014 all former university professors \u2014 advocated in USA Today for their plan to simplify the financial aid process without increasing federal spending. \"Community colleges are the best buy and the most nimble part of higher education,\" the senators wrote. \"If you want to change those two things, the surest way to do that is a new federal program that misses the mark.\" 9:30 a.m. SO, ABOUT THAT MIDDLE-CLASS TAX PROPOSAL ... \u2014 Your thoughts on Obama\u2019s tax plan that he will discuss at length this evening, key Republican committee chairmen? \u2014 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), today: \"[The plan] appears to be more about redistribution, with added complexity and class warfare, directed at job-creating small businesses than about tax reform.\" \u2014 Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), yesterday: \"[W]e see now what the president had mind: a $320 billion tax hike on savings and investment, largely to fuel more Washington spending \u2013 and make the tax code even more complex. One word comes to mind. Seriously?\" 9:10 a.m. THE SURVIVOR SWEEPSTAKES \u2014 Every year, the president designates one Cabinet member to stay behind from the State of the Union address and away from Capitol Hill in case of a catastrophic event. Philip Bump of The Washington Post, using data from the UCSB American Presidency Project, takes a look at the last three decades of survivors. Six Interior and six Agriculture secretaries have stuck behind in the last 30 years, tied for the highest number. Obama has picked his Energy secretary the past two years \u2014Steven Chu in 2013 and Ernest Moniz in 2014. 8:45 a.m. HOW LONG WILL HE TALK? \u2014 Several strategists told POLITICO\u2019s Kendall Breitman to expect a relatively short State of the Union address this evening. But CBS News White House correspondent and unofficial White House record-keeper Mark Knoller notes that history indicates Obama\u2019s speech will probably last at least an hour. Correction: Pres Obama's 2nd SOTU Address was his longest: 1 hr 26 mins. His 4th was shortest: 1 hr. Average length: 1 hr 9 mins. \u2014 Mark Knoller (@markknoller) January 20, 2015 8:20 a.m. POETRY VS. PROSE \u2014 A fascinating nugget from this great Michael S. Schmidt profile of Cody Keenan, the oft-bearded speechwriter who drafted tonight\u2019s speech, centers on the president\u2019s shift in rhetorical style. Schmidt contrasts Keenan with former chief speechwriter Jon Favreau, who wrote for Obama during his first campaign and throughout his first term. While Favreau was responsible for much of Obama\u2019s soaring oratory the earned him significant attention at the beginning of his career, Keenan\u2019s grittier, more blue-collar prose has defined much of the president\u2019s tone in the dog days of his second term. \"Keenan, the president\u2019s chief speechwriter for nearly all of the second term, is a different breed from his predecessor, Jon Favreau, who was known for his ability to write lofty, big-picture speeches about hope and change,\" Schmidt writes. \"Mr. Keenan focuses far more on individual, hard-work stories as parables for what is difficult but still possible in America.\" 8:00 a.m. IN THE FLOTUS BOX \u2014 First lady Michelle Obama will be hosting more than 20 guests for the speech this evening, the White House announced yesterday. They include: \u2014 Alan Gross, a contractor who spent five years imprisoned in Cuba before the White House secured his release last month as part of the deal between the two countries. \u2014 Dr. Pranav Shetty, who oversaw two Ebola treatment units in Liberia in August and will go to Guinea later this week to help fight the disease there. \u2014 Larry Merlo, CEO of CVS Health, the first major pharmacy to ban tobacco sales. \u2014 Ana Zamora, a DREAMer finishing up her last year of college at Northwood University in Texas. \u2014 Catherine Pugh, Maryland Senate majority leader and president-elect of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators. For the full list, go here. 7:30 a.m. DUELING NARRATIVES: WHO\u2019S IN CHARGE? \u2014 Good morning from Washington, D.C., where the White House and congressional Republicans are already squaring off over the importance of tonight\u2019s speech. In many ways, the back-and-forth over tonight\u2019s State of the Union address is another battle in the larger turf war between the GOP and the Obama administration following the November midterms. As POLITICO\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere reports, the White House is hoping to build on the president\u2019s momentum from the last two months to make a simple point: He\u2019s still very much relevant, even as a lame duck. \"[T]here\u2019s really only one thing Obama is trying to get across: He\u2019s still here,\" Dovere writes. The White House has resisted ceding ground to congressional Republicans since their midterm victory, instead going on the offense with an immigration executive order, normalizing relations with Cuba, a climate deal with China and a middle-class tax plan he will discuss at length tonight. Obama, who seems somewhat liberated following the election, has an approval rating of 50 percent for the first time in about a year and a half, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. But congressional Republicans are already downplaying tonight\u2019s address as \"just another presidential speech,\" John Bresnahan and Manu Raju report: \"They\u2019re giving the president his turn in the spotlight \u2014 but that\u2019s about it. They say there\u2019s very little chance it will change their agenda, and on Wednesday they\u2019re getting back to business by pushing the bills they want to,\" they write. Republicans have their own set of priorities \u2014 reining in Obama on immigration and Iran, putting a Keystone XL pipeline bill on the president\u2019s desk, taking aim at the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that they plan to push aggressively with majorities in both chambers. We\u2019ll continue to monitor this dynamic between the White House and congressional GOP throughout the day and into this evening.", "Is it just us, or is the world's least-visited country actually one of the most beautiful places to ever exist? Kiribati (pronounced kiri-bas) had just 6,000 visitors last year -- this makes it the least-visited country on Earth for which data is available from the United Nations World Tourism Organization. But Kiribati should have many, MANY more passers-by, if these photos have anything to say about it. The beaches are so sprawling, the water so blissfully clear, and the vegetation so verdantly tropical that this paradise is an ideal -- and severely underappreciated -- island escape. Kiribati is a string of 33 islands way out in the Pacific Ocean. A small nation all its own, Kiribati has quaint, tropical lodges to house the brave souls who trek here for top-notch diving, surfing, swimming and record-breaking game fishing. Japanese and American forces battled at Kiribati\u2019s main islands during World War II, so you can visit the site of the battle, or examine eight-inch coastal defense guns and solid concrete bunkers left from World War II. Kiribati's tourism website also says that shipwrecks, and rusted crafts can be seen on the shores during low tide. Channel facing Buota Deserted beach on Christmas Island Tarawa Lagoon This place is fascinating, but perhaps its lack of visitors is due to inaccessibility: flights are scarce, though Fiji Airways has a return weekly service to Kiribati between Nadi, Fiji and Honolulu, Hawaii. Once you get to Kiribati, though, a land of relaxation, beauty and history awaits. The worst part, though, is that Kiribati is quickly disappearing. The nation recently purchased 6,000 acres of land from Fiji, presumably so Kiribati's citizens can eventually relocate before the effects of climate change overtake their precarious island nation. We're on our way, Kiribati!

Kaepernick\u2019s decision to sit or take a knee during the national anthem first drew attention after his team\u2019s Aug. 26 preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, when he told NFL.com that he was \"not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\" Since then, Kaepernick\u2019s continued protest has drawn considerable criticism from politicians, police unions, pundits, other professional athletes and many on social media who have opposed both his message and his method of conveying it. But the problem Kaepernick wants to highlight has continued. And on Monday, it was back in the news again, after police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, released multiple videos that showed the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher. The videos show that 40-year-old Crutcher, like so many other black men, was unarmed with his hands in the air when police officers shot and killed him as he returned to his car, which had stalled in the middle of a roadway. The videos run contrary to the department\u2019s initial statements about the shooting, which claimed that Crutcher had ignored officers\u2019 warning to raise his hands. Since @Kaepernick7 attempted to raise awareness about police reform in America, police have killed 67 people. In 22 days. #TerenceCrutcher \u2014 Black Irish (@Mint_mulatto) September 19, 2016 Overall, police have killed at least 67 people since Kaepernick\u2019s protest began, according to The Guardian\u2019s database. Roughly 22 percent of the victims have been black. Police have killed more than 780 people so far in 2016, according to The Guardian\u2019s numbers. At least 193 of those people \u2015 or about 25 percent \u2015 were black. Of the 15 black people killed since Kaepernick\u2019s demonstration started, at least 11 were shot, according to The Washington Post\u2019s tracker of fatal police shootings. The white officer who shot Crutcher, Betty Shelby, was placed on paid administrative leave while the department investigates the case \u2015 another issue Kaepernick highlighted when he spoke out against police killings. \"To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,\" Kaepernick said. \"There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\" ASSOCIATED PRESS Terence Crutcher, 40, is one of at least 15 African-Americans to die during encounters with police since Kaepernick began protesting before NFL games in late August. Kaepernick\u2019s message has spread across the sports world since the start of the NFL season. Players on a number of NFL teams \u2015 including the Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos and Tennessee Titans \u2015 joined his demonstration during the first week of the NFL season. The Denver Broncos\u2019 Brandon Marshall, who has taken a knee during the anthem, responded to the Terence Crutcher video by saying such situations are the \"exact reason we\u2019re protesting.\" Some of the protests have drawn the ire of police. In Miami, the union that represents the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office called on the department to stop providing security details for Dolphins\u2019 games after four members of the team knelt during the anthem last week. \"In certain professions,\" the head of the union said, \"an individual\u2019s freedom of speech must take a back seat to the organization or government entity that they choose to represent.\" The NFL Players Association, which has stood behind Kaepernick\u2019s right to protest, fired back at that statement Monday. \"Don\u2019t we stop being the land of the free and the home of the brave when a citizen is asked to take a \u2018backseat\u2019 for expressing his freedom by those sworn to defend it?\" DeMaurice Smith, the NFLPA\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \"Players don\u2019t stop being men and citizens just because they are wearing a jersey.\" And while many have questioned how a black athlete could qualify as oppressed, recent cases highlight that Kaepernick and other black athletes are also at risk of experiencing police violence.", "Your child has a big test tomorrow. What takes priority: more studying or going to bed? Well, according to new research, letting your kid catch a few more Zzs might matter more when it comes to getting a good grade. Small increases of sleep\u2014a little over 18 minutes every school night\u2014were linked to grade improvements in elementary schoolers. For the study, researchers at McGill University and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute created a sleep education program to be taught in three elementary schools. The curriculum focused on using age-appropriate methods to teach healthy sleep habits and hygiene. For example, first and second graders were shown a video about a boy who sleeps in an overly stimulating room and loses sleep. Overall, 71 students between the ages of seven and 11 participated in weekly two-hour interactive classes for six weeks. At home, parents helped to measure student sleep by affixing a monitor on the non-dominant wrist at bedtime for four weeknights. Parents also gave researchers their children's report cards at the beginning and end of the program. At the end of the study, students slept, on average, 18.2 minutes longer a night than they did before going through the program. They also slept 2.3 percent better, overall. This translated into a significant improvement in mathematics and English grades, too. Researchers conclude that sleep is an important factor in learning potential, and cooperation with both parents and educators is needed to make sure kids are getting enough sleep.

Windows has long been the undisputed king of computer operating systems when it comes to gaming. But is Linux getting to the point where it can take on Windows in PC gaming? A writer at TechRadar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of Linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for PCs. Game Carey reports for TechRadar: Evidently, Windows isn\u2019t going anywhere, with a Steam market share of nearly 96% as of March 2016. In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to \"monopolize\" PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there\u2019s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve\u2019s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn\u2019t help that a number of companies still haven\u2019t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system\u2019s handicaps. There\u2019s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10. More at TechRadar DistroWatch reviews FreeBSD 10.3\u2019s new features Jesse Smith at DistroWatch did a full review of FreeBSD 10.0 a while back, and now he has some thoughts to share about the new features that have been added to the recently released FreeBSD 10.3. Jesse Smith reports for DistroWatch: FreeBSD is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project\u2019s focus on performance and stability. At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD\u2019s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host\u2019s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux. More at DistroWatch Linus Torvalds releases Linux kernel 4.6 Linus has been very busy working on the next release of the Linux kernel, and now Linux 4.6 has been released into the wild. Simon Sharwood reports on what's new in Linux kernel 4.6 for The Register: New this time around is support for a bunch more ARM systems-on-a-chip, including Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 820. IBM\u2019s POWER9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won\u2019t arrive until late 2016. Whatever CPU you use to run Linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, OrangeFS, XFS, Btrfs and EXT 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while F2FS is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage. Dell\u2019s laptops will play nicer with Linux thanks to driver changes that permit hotkeys to be pressed into service. Raspberry Pi users may appreciate new drivers that are said to do lovely things for 3D graphics performance. More at The Register Did you miss a roundup?

Unless you obsessively follow NASA\u2019s press releases or mine their archives, it\u2019s easy to miss a lot of new, intriguing research. Emily Lakdawalla, Senior Editor and Planetary Evangelist for The Planetary Society, is on a mission to change that. \"Having done some research as a grad student, I got this sense that there\u2019s a lot of exciting things happening in research but the public doesn\u2019t ever hear about it. I saw that if I were just a researcher, I would do my own little research on tectonics on Venus and write these long papers that nobody would ever read or I could understand what a lot of other people were doing and translate it for the public. I saw that the way for me to have the greatest impact on science was not by doing research but rather by having this communication role,\" says Emily. She found that role at The Planetary Society. Emily empowers others to get involved in science and space through sharing such research and images on the blog. Yet there were many steps she took to get to her present position as one of the most prominent voices in space science. She taught fifth and sixth grade science for a few years, and then obtained a master\u2019s in planetary geology. She was originally hired by The Planetary Society to coordinate an education project, and after the project ended, was asked to write about the Cassini mission to Saturn. \"At first I needed a lot of editing because my most recent writing had been academic writing or environmental consulting writing, which is not very entertaining to read. For about two years I was edited and then they kind of took the training wheels off,\" says Emily. She began to blog when The Planetary Society launched its first solar sail mission. \"That spacecraft ended up on the bottom of the ocean, but for a couple of weeks it was really unclear what the heck had happened to it. So every day I would be writing, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t have any news today, but let me tell you about something else that\u2019s happening in space,\u2019 and I just never stopped blogging after that,\" she says. Her blog, Snapshots from Space, shares new research not often covered elsewhere in terms even those without a science background can understand. Sometimes she simply shows \"pretty pictures\" and provides a context for why those pictures are useful for scientists or engineers. Over the decade the blog has existed, she has found new ways to stir up conversation about scientific developments as online communication has evolved. \"It\u2019s been real fun to be in the middle of this social media revolution that\u2019s happening on the web right now. When I started doing my writing for The Planetary Society, there was this very top-down model for how to get information out to the public where NASA or ESA or whoever generated content and then it flowed downhill from experts to translators like me, and then downhill from me to the wide public. But nowadays, there\u2019s a lot more interaction,\" Emily says. \"You have so many scientists on Twitter who are directly interacting with the public. You have a lot of experts within the public who have always been out there; it\u2019s just that the communication channels weren\u2019t open. So you have this kind of flattening of the hierarchy where there\u2019s a lot of information flowing back and forth from the public to the scientists, from the scientists to the public, and I\u2019m just enjoying sitting in the middle of all of that.\" Emily is currently writing a book about the Mars Curiosity mission; watch for it in 2017.

And Taylor revealed what first drew her to the industry in a press release at the time: 'My idea of a great song is a song that says how I feel better than I could. I feel the same way about greeting cards,' she said. 'I've always been fascinated by feelings and how we express them to each other. Getting to write and design these cards is a wonderful experience.'

And she won't like what he has to say: But when asked Wednesday by Fox News about Clinton's characterization of the bureau's probe, FBI Director James Comey said he doesn\u2019t know what \"security inquiry\" means \u2014 adding, \"We\u2019re conducting an investigation. ... That\u2019s what we do.\" The FBI director reiterated that he\u2019s \"not familiar with the term security inquiry\" when told that is the phrase Clinton has used. As for the timeline for the investigation, Comey, during a briefing with reporters, said he prefers doing the investigation \"well\" over promptly and said he\u2019s not \"tethered\" to a schedule. The briefing comes amid reports that FBI investigators have been meeting with top aides in Clinton\u2019s inner circle, including Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. The interviews have stoked speculation that the investigation may soon be drawing to a close, in the heat of the 2016 political season. Specifically, FBI Director Comey reassures the public that the agency is conducting a real \"investigation.\" Ouch. When asked by Fox if Clinton could face criminal charges, Comey wouldn't comment. But he also added, \"There are no special set of rules for anybody that the FBI investigates.\"", "When will the foolishness and hoopla around black people's hair stop? Over the past year we've had to hear about a little girl being kicked out of school for wearing locs, an Ohio school banning a list of natural hairstyles and let's not forget meteorologist Rhonda Lee who was fired for defending her right to rock her natural hair on TV. Now comes news out of Baltimore that a black woman has allegedly been fired from her job because of her blonde highlights. Farryn Johnson told Maryland's CBS News affiliate that she was let go from her job as a waitress at Hooters due to '\"improper image\" after the 25-year-old refused to remove blonde highlights from her dark brown hair. \"They specifically said, 'Black women don't have blonde in their hair, so you need to take it out,'\" Johnson told CBS. \"I didn't see that it would be a big issue just because there were a lot of other employees working at the restaurant of other races with color in their hair. For instance, there were Asian girls with red hair and Caucasian girls with black hair and blond streaks so I didn't think it would be an issue for the little piece of blond highlight in my hair.\" Johnson has reportedly filed a racial discrimination complaint with the Maryland Commission on Civil Right. \"The law is clear that employers can't have two separate unequal sets of rules\u2014one for African-Americans employees and one for everybody else, and yet that's exactly what Hooters did here in firing Miss Johnson, an African-American employee solely because she's African-American. They targeted her because of her hair solely because of her race,\" Johnson's attorney, Jessica Weber, told CBS.", "Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo (9) throws during an afternoon practice at training camp in Oxnard, Calif., on Friday, Aug. 5, 2016. (Max Faulkner/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS via Getty Images) Everyone used to know who America's Team was. These days, it's not as obvious. The Dallas Cowboys will never fully lose the lofty \"America's Team\" nickname, but the title has certainly not been earned in recent years. The Cowboys might make a load of money -- the franchise is the most valuable in the world, according to Forbes -- but that's where the relevance stops. Business is only half the game, at best, and in the modern media landscape, the product on the field matters more and more every year. Look at a franchise like the Golden State Warriors. Before Stephen Curry became the back-to-back MVP of the NBA, the Warriors were arguably the worst franchise in all of sports. The Chicago Blackhawks couldn't put 3,000 people in the United Center before 2008 -- now the Hawks are a cash cow that might as well have a national TV deal. Relevance comes cheap these days. Staying power is hard to maintain. Amid these truths, the Cowboys are testing fate -- they're a worse-than .500 team in recent years that is cashing in on its reputation from 20 years ago. Since 2010, the Cowboys have been 46-50, with three-straight 8-8 years from 2011 to 2014. The Cowboys haven't been to the NFC Championship Game since 1995, the season they last won the Super Bowl. The Redskins and Lions can boast longer NFC title game droughts, but that isn't saying much -- think about how many times the Bears have gone from bad to good and back in that 20-year stretch. The Cowboys have given those under the age of 25 nothing worthwhile to remember them from, outside of three above-average regular seasons, and it shows. The Cowboys are reportedly concerned about the team's lack of success and how the brand -- the most valuable brand in the NFL -- doesn't resonate with the new generation of fans. They should be concerned. The Cowboys might be the most popular team in the NFL, according to the most recent numbers from Harris , but the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers are the favorite teams of those under the age of 30. The Cowboys make up the big meaty middle -- they're the dominant team of those aged 30-64 -- but that group doesn't determine who is cool these days. Ninety-four percent of respondents under the age of 30 told Public Policy Polling before the Super Bowl that the Cowboys were not \"America's Team.\" PPP also found that no survey takers from ages 18-29 listed the Cowboys as their favorite team, but 41 percent of those under-30s did say the Cowboys were their least favorite team. In all, the Cowboys were the second least-liked team in the NFL, despite the fact that they haven't posed much of a threat to anyone for the last 15-or-so years. High disapproval and an aging and diminishing support base -- it doesn't take a political scientist to figure out that if the Cowboys don't change paths soon, they're going to see a precipitous fall. (Donald Trump, who shares these polling qualities, probably thinks the Cowboys shouldn't change a thing.) So who is America's Team these days? Well, polling shows that if you're winning, you're the favorite. How else would the Carolina Panthers be the favorite team of under-30s? Given the flippant nature of fandom, the correct answer might be \"none of the above.\" The social media age, the constant expansion of fantasy football, the RedZone channel, and ability to watch any game you want on any device you can imagine might make the unaffiliated the most influential NFL fans. Fans might say they like the local team, but it's not hard to imagine a scenario where they care as much about their fantasy team as what the Titans are doing. Alas, even if they win big this year, it might be too late for the Cowboys to earn back the \"America's Team\" title.", "Andrew Kaczynski/BuzzFeed News ID: 9717250 Donald Trump made an appearance in an explicit 2000 Playboy video.

In fact, violence perpetrated by blacks on white victims is on the rise in America, largely thanks to people like Sharpton who, under the guise of social justice, promote hate and incite vengeful violence on the grounds that black people are owed something due to past injustices.

Showing the animal\u2019s reaction to a simple sleight-of-hand conjuring trick, the images took the animal from puzzlement through understanding to what seemed a glorious fit of joyous laughter. If you thought only humans could see a joke, it was time for an immediate re-think. The orangutan had been shown a \u2018now you see it now you don\u2019t\u2019 trick by a handler, who first showed the animal a chestnut in a cup and then secretly removed the nut before showing the cup again. When the orangutan cottoned on that he\u2019d been \u2018had\u2019, he responded with what we humans can\u2019t help but understand as hilarity, rolling on the floor in apparent mirth. The orangutan was laughing at the wacky incongruity of seeing a chestnut in a cup and then finding it gone. Just like that! As Tommy Cooper would have said. It all begs the question: do animals really have a sense of humour? Or rather \u2014 because humans are animals \u2014 do non-human animals have a sense of humour? Or is humour actually a barrier that divides us from our closest animal relatives and from every other species? This sounds like the cue for a million stories about how your dog enjoys a laugh \u2014 almost every owner has his or her own anecdotes of canine pranks that suggest a real (if primitive) sense of humour. Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian zoologist who won the Nobel Prize in 1973, believed dogs laughed when they played.  \u2018The slightly opened jaws which reveal the tongue, and the tilted angle of the mouth which stretches almost from ear to ear, give an impression of laughing,\u2019 he said. \u2018This \"laughing\" is most often seen in dogs playing with an adored master and which become so excited they soon start panting.\u2019 But is the panting \u2018laughter\u2019 Konrad witnessed simply a factor of canine physiology? Dogs may look as if they\u2019re laughing when they\u2019re doing nothing of the sort. So what about other species? There is a YouTube video of a dolphin in a glass tank, looking out as a lithe girl performs graceful acrobatics for his benefit. The dolphin stops and is clearly delighted: humans walk on their feet, they don\u2019t usually spring head over heels. It certainly looks as if the dolphin is laughing. Part of this is because the dolphin\u2019s face looks uncannily like a laughing human. One of the reasons we love dolphins is because they seem to have a permanent smile: but that\u2019s just anatomy. Even though it\u2019s clear the dolphin finds this acrobat\u2019s behaviour fascinating, this isn\u2019t enough to prove scientifically that animals can laugh. Even my two favourite stories about non-human humour aren\u2019t proof because they, too, are anecdotes, not scientific evidence gleaned from repeated experiments.  Both concern a gorilla called Koko, who lives in California and, it is claimed, can respond to 2,000 spoken words in English, and understand and communicate using 1,000 words in a modified version of American Sign Language. Koko was asked: \u2018What is hard?\u2019 In response, she made a joke \u2014 to be more accurate, she made a pun: making the signals for \u2018rock\u2019 and \u2018work\u2019. She appeared to understand an incongruous connection \u2014 both rocks and work being hard \u2014 that comes about through language. Another time Koko was working (hard, no doubt) with her trainer Francine Patterson. She tied Patterson\u2019s shoelaces together \u2014 and then signed \u2018chase\u2019. Anyone who has played with a four-year-old child can understand the hilarity and daring of this comic effort. The trouble is that such things can\u2019t really be put to rigid experimental testing, not least because scientific procedure is essentially humourless.  There is, after all, a difference between watching The Morecambe And Wise Christmas Special in laboratory conditions and doing so on your sofa after Christmas dinner with your dear ones and a glass of single malt. But there are scientific experiments that suggest some animals can and do laugh. Dr Marina Davila-Ross of the Department of Psychology at Portsmouth University spent years analysing the sounds apes made when they were tickled, and comparing them with human laughter. Our nearest animal relatives, the chimps and bonobos \u2014 who share more than 98 per cent of their DNA with humans \u2014 made the noises that were most like human laughter. Dr Davila-Ross also studied the noises chimps and bonobos made when mucking about with each other \u2014 or \u2018play-fighting\u2019. Human children laugh when they indulge in play-fighting. It\u2019s much the same in the archetypal situation of wrestling with or being tickled by your dad. Play-fighting is, for some reason, hilarious. When chimpanzees play-fight, they pant. They don\u2019t pant in the same way as they do in other contexts, such as when they are exhausted or being bullied \u2014 a bullied chimp makes noises that express fear, not fun. The play-fight panting sounds quite a lot like laughter and what\u2019s more, there is an evolutionary reason for it.  While the young animals are getting lessons in fighting, their laughter makes clear they are not being hurt in the rough-and-tumble. It\u2019s fighting that\u2019s fun and affectionate. Gorillas and orangutans pant in the same way and science has now shown that all the great apes seem to have something that can be called laughter.  \u2018The play-fighting serves a very social function,\u2019 says Peter McGraw, a psychologist at the University of Colorado.  \u2018Some is bonding and some is learning to fight. But what you always see is that the animal being attacked is the one making these vocalisations, which we interpret as laughter. \u2018I believe that through evolution, laughter developed as a way of showing that something which would otherwise be wrong is OK.\u2019 And that, surely, shows the link between animal laughter and our own. In humans, laughter has evolved from its play-fighting origins into an essential social tool to express a vast gamut of feelings. But it\u2019s still used to make sense and fun of the incongruous \u2014 to show \u2018something which would otherwise be wrong is OK\u2019. Dolphins play-fight, too, and when they do so they make a brief series of sonar pulses followed by a whistle. The sound is never made during serious aggressive encounters. The sound is telling the opponent this is just larking about. Play-fighting in humans often involves tickling and tickling involves giggling. This led to a series of experiments at Bowling Green University in Ohio, where they observed that rats make ultra-sonic chirps of pleasure when play-fighting and playing chase. They then found rats make the same sounds when being tickled. \u2018I don\u2019t necessarily call it laughter,\u2019 said researcher Jeffrey Burgdorf. \u2018I call it a signal of positive intent.\u2019 A shared response to pleasurable incongruity, friendship and fun doesn\u2019t seem to be restricted to the human species. Charles Darwin argued that there was \u2018no fundamental difference between man and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness and misery\u2019. Put a big stress on the word \u2018fundamental\u2019 and you grasp his point. Whenever you look for a cast-iron certain way of separating humans from all other forms of animals, you find instead a grey area, a no man\u2019s land in which the differences seem muddied and uncertain. Many animals use complex forms of communication that can be called language. Many solve difficult problems. Some make and use tools. Grief has often been observed. Elephants have been seen burying their dead, vampire bats engage in altruism, humpback whales have culture, bowerbirds create visual art, nightingales compose and perform music. Whenever you look at the difference between humans and animals you only find differences of degree. Humans have a sense of humour and we can, if we look with the right eyes, find its origin in species other than our own. Even in our dogs.", "SHEfinds receives commissions for purchases made through the links in this post. Of all the beauty myths that never made a whole lot of sense, this old wives\u2019 tale probably takes the cake: if you pull out one gray hair, a bunch more will grow back. Once and for all, here\u2019s the truth. Not only is this weird saying totally false\u2013it\u2019s also biologically impossible. \"The hair follicle (the little tube beneath the skin that contains the root of the hair) only contains one hair,\" says Carly Bowers, expert for Latest-Hairstyles.com. \"Pulling out one gray hair won\u2019t cause two hairs to grow in its place; it will simply eliminate the hair until another one grows back in it\u2019s place.\" I\u2019m afraid there is a bit of bad news, however: if you happen to find a single gray hair, pulling it so you can get on with your life isn\u2019t a good solution. \"Plucking each hair will just cause them to grow back and they will grow back gray,\" says Dr. David E. Bank, founder of The Center for Dermatology, Cosmetic & Laser Surgery. \"The reason? The pigment-producing cells at the hair follicle are most likely worn out so matter what you do, the hair will grow back gray.\" Gray hair occurs when melanocytes in the hair stop producing melanin, causing pigment loss, Bank explains. \"This is mainly caused by genetics, but it can occur with prolonged illness or stress. Even medications such as chemo-therapeutics, Ferritin, Vitamin D3, Methotrexate, Lithium, Echinacea and Vitamin E may lead to gray hair,\" Bank says. In addition to not being effective, plucking hairs can also cause permanent damage and scarring to the hair follicle, says Dr. Tsippora Shainhouse at Rapaport Dermatology of Beverly Hills. \"In this case, the hair would be unable to grow back at all, and you would have a bald spot where that hair was,\" Shainhouse says. \"True, it would be small, but if you keep plucking out the grays, you could cause permanent thinning of your hair.\" Your best bet when trying to cover up a few grays is to use a permanent marker, says Shainhouse, or a temporary hair color like L\u2019Oreal Paris Root Rescue, which comes with a special applicator designed to make root application a breeze. \"If a person finds one or two gray hairs and doesn\u2019t want to have to change her color, there are plenty of very temporary solutions,\" Bowers says. \"Using a colored hair powder only on the area where the gray hairs are will work. Bumble and Bumble makes a great one. Or, you can have your hairstylist put just a touch of color on the area with grays.\" Whatever you do: keep your tweezers far, far away from your scalp.

It\u2019s just not good enough. That\u2019s the message of the spate of recent polls showing a dramatically tightened race that Trump may even be narrowly winning. The truth is that Trump is not doing well. Even Trump\u2019s very best recent polls (which, by definition, are outliers that likely overstate his true level of support) show him receiving fewer votes than Republican candidates usually get. A recent CNN poll of Ohio , for example, that gave him a 5-point lead in the crucial swing state also shows him only getting 46 percent of the vote. Mitt Romney and John McCain both did better than that. Clinton\u2019s attacks and Trump\u2019s well-known weaknesses seem to have him losing the support of some GOP loyalists, even in his best polls. The problem is that Clinton herself is doing worse. Because despite her campaign\u2019s emphasis on Trump\u2019s weirdness and unpopularity, that isn\u2019t the only force shaping this race. It\u2019s profoundly unusual across two other dimensions \u2014 the strength of third party candidates and the weakness of the frontrunner \u2014 that will probably prevent Clinton from ever opening up a sustained comfortable lead unless she can do something to make herself better-liked. Clinton is a freakishly unpopular frontrunner Despite a couple of days\u2019 worth of bad polls, Clinton still leads in national polling averages. It remains the case that if the election were held tomorrow, she would win. It is totally unheard of to win a presidential election while having deeply underwater favorable ratings, and it is actually quite common to lose one despite above water favorable ratings. Since there are only two major party nominees in the race and they are both far underwater right now, it\u2019s pretty likely that precedent will be shattered. But we are in a bit of an undiscovered country in terms of the underlying opinion dynamics. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are doing remarkably well If those numbers hold up (which of course they might not), they would make Johnson the strongest third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992. That\u2019s a big deal. Stein\u2019s strength is, however, even more unusual. She is polling ahead of where Ralph Nader did in 2000 and is the strongest fourth-party candidate we\u2019ve seen in a 100 years, besting both the Thurmond and Wallace tickets from the infamously four-sided election of 1948. To find a fourth-place candidate polling higher than Stein\u2019s current results, you need to dial all the way back to the 6 percent of the vote Eugene Debs earned in the bizarre 1912 election that saw the GOP nominee (the incumbent, no less!) finish in third place behind a third-party bid spearheaded by ex-president Teddy Roosevelt. For a stable lead, Clinton needs to be liked These two unusual quirks of the 2016 race seem to be linked. Lambasting Trump while being unpopular herself would be a clear winning strategy in a zero-sum head-to-head race. But in a four-sided race, where the two lesser candidates aren\u2019t receiving much scrutiny from the press or the campaigns, it tends to have the side consequence of pressing a lot of people to Johnson or Stein. The fact that there are two different third-party candidates in the race \u2014 one for people who think Clinton\u2019s too left and one for people who think she\u2019s not left enough \u2014 makes it really difficult to avoid bleeding voters. If polls stay very tight or Trump pulls into a lead, then anti-Trump messaging to Johnson and Stein voters could take the form of classic warnings about spoilers and wasted votes. But the fact that Clinton has been consistently leading in the polls \u2014 and in August was doing so by a large margin \u2014 has itself undercut purely tactical arguments for voting Clinton. If she is overwhelmingly likely to win, which is what people have been hearing, then you may as well not vote for her if you don\u2019t like her. It\u2019s simply going to be very hard for Clinton to open up the kind of stable lead that her supporters think Trump\u2019s awfulness deserves while she herself is so little-liked. September of a general election year is probably not a great time to turn that around. But the fact remains that her basic problem in this race is almost painfully simple. Over the course of her winning primary campaign she became a deeply unpopular figure. And it\u2019s hard \u2014 indeed, unprecedented \u2014 for such an unpopular person to win the presidency. The bad map we see every presidential election", "I'm sure you've been asked many times whether you're an introvert or an extrovert. For some people, it's an easy choice, but for most of us, it's difficult to choose one way or the other. It's hard to choose because the introvert/extrovert dichotomy reflects a tired and outdated view of personality. Personality traits exist along a continuum, and the vast majority of us aren't introverts or extroverts we fall somewhere in the middle. Personality consists of a stable set of preferences and tendencies through which we approach the world. Personality traits form at an early age and are fixed by early adulthood. Many important things about you change over the course of your lifetime, but your personality isn't one of them. Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it. Bruce Lee The continuum between introversion and extroversion captures one of the most important personality traits. It's troubling that we're encouraged to categorize ourselves one way or the other because there are critical strengths and weaknesses commonly associated with each type. Adam Grant at Wharton set out to study this phenomenon, and his findings are fascinating. First, he found that two-thirds of people don't strongly identify as introverts or extroverts. These people (a.k.a., the vast majority of us) are called ambiverts, who have both introverted and extroverted tendencies. The direction ambiverts lean toward varies greatly, depending on the situation. Think of introversion and extroversion as a spectrum, with ambiversion lying somewhere in the middle: Source: TalentSmart Ambiverts have a distinct advantage over true introverts and extroverts. Because their personality doesn't lean too heavily in either direction, they have a much easier time adjusting their approach to people based on the situation. This enables them to connect more easily, and more deeply, with a wider variety of people. Grant's research also disproved the powerful and widely held notion that the best-performing salespeople are extroverts. He found that ambiverts' greater social flexibility enabled them to outsell all other groups, moving 51% more product per hour than the average salesperson. Notice how sales increased as extroversion increased, peaking with those who were just moderately extroverted. Source: Adam Grant Grant explained the finding this way: Because they naturally engage in a flexible pattern of talking and listening, ambiverts are likely to express sufficient assertiveness and enthusiasm to persuade and close a sale, but are more inclined to listen to customers' interests and less vulnerable to appearing too excited or overconfident. How Ambiversion Works In The Brain How social you are is largely driven by dopamine, the brain's feel-good hormone. We all have different levels of dopamine-fueled stimulation in the neocortex (the area of the brain that is responsible for higher mental functions such as language and conscious thought). Those who naturally have high levels of stimulation tend to be introverts they try and avoid any extra social stimulation that might make them feel anxious or overwhelmed. Those with low levels of stimulation tend to be extroverts. Under-stimulation leaves extroverts feeling bored, so they seek social stimulation to feel good. Most people's levels of natural stimulation don't reach great extremes, though it does fluctuate. Sometimes you may feel the need to seek out stimulation, while other times, you may avoid it. Finding Out Whether You're An Ambivert It's important to pin down where you fall in the introversion/extroversion scale. By increasing your awareness of your type, you can develop a better sense of your tendencies and play to your strengths. If you think that you might be an ambivert, but aren't certain, see how many of the following statements apply to you. If most of them apply, you're most likely an ambivert. 1. I can perform tasks alone or in a group. I don't have much preference either way. 2. Social settings don't make me uncomfortable, but I tire of being around people too much. 3. Being the center of attention is fun for me, but I don't like it to last. 4. Some people think I'm quiet, while others think I'm highly social. 5. I don't always need to be moving, but too much down time leaves me feeling bored. 6. I can get lost in my own thoughts just as easily as I can lose myself in a conversation. 7. Small talk doesn't make me uncomfortable, but it does get boring. 8. When it comes to trusting other people, sometimes I'm skeptical, and other times, I dive right in. 9. If I spend too much time alone, I get bored, yet too much time around other people leaves me feeling drained. The trick to being an ambivert is knowing when to force yourself to lean toward one side of the spectrum when it isn't happening naturally. Ambiverts with low self-awareness struggle with this. For example, at a networking event, a self-aware ambivert will lean toward the extroverted side of the scale, even when it has been a long day and he or she has had enough of people. Mismatching your approach to the situation can be frustrating, ineffective, and demoralizing for ambiverts. TalentSmart has conducted research with over a million people and found that those in the upper echelon of performance at work also tend to be highly self-aware (90% of them, in fact). By gaining a better sense of where you fall on the introversion/extroversion scale, you can build insight into your tendencies and preferences, which increases your self-awareness and emotional intelligence. This will help you improve your performance.", "It's fascinating that Peter Berg directed \"Lone Survivor.\" Fascinating only in the respect that Berg's previous movie, \"Battleship,\" was also a military themed film, yet \"Battleship and \"Lone Survivor\" could not be more different from one another. But that's the thing about Berg: his films are hard to, let's say, pin down. A story he tells ahead about his directorial debut, \"Very Bad Things,\" pretty much illustrates exactly that: In the theater, he hears people laughing; outside, he sees a woman vomiting. The same man who directed the theatrical version of \"Friday Night Lights\" also directed \"Hancock\" and the aforementioned \"Battleship.\" Berg refers to his early directing style as \"creatively reckless.\" It might also be an apt phrase for his filmography. Berg's latest, \"Lone Survivor,\" is the true story of four Navy SEALs (played by Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch) ambushed by the Taliban in 2005. The film is based on a book by former SEAL Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg), and Berg makes \"Lone Survivor\" an almost overwhelming re-creation of those events. I met Berg at an Upper West Side hotel where we talked about \"Lone Survivor,\" his lingering disappointment with the box-office results for \"Battleship,\" and that poor woman who threw up at the premiere of \"Very Bad Things.\" This is an intense movie. It made me feel physically tired. Yeah, that was one of all of our goals for everyone involved in the film -- to put someone into the experience of what these guys went through. And it was obviously a traumatic and violent and exhausting experience. The first two acts especially do make you feel like you're with them. Is there a trick to doing that? What might be the kind of secret ingredient, if you will, is the amount of research we all did before we ever started shooting. I spent two years developing this script and I got to go to Iraq and embed with the Navy SEAL platoon for a month. And I spent a of of time with Marcus Luttrell and a lot of time with the families of the soldiers who were killed. I feel there's a misconception that this movie isn't for the squeamish. It's intense, but the violence isn't something that will make a normal person feel sick. I think it's the totality of the intensity of the experience. Because it really happened -- and we stayed true to what really happened -- it feels much more gruesome, visually, than it really is. People have asked me about it: \"It's such a gruesome, bloody film.\" Well, not really. Go look at a \"Saw\" movie -- it's nothing like that. The scenes where the group is falling down the side of a mountain is exemplified by the sounds being made when they hit a tree. What was used to make that sound? It's hitting trees. Really? Yeah. So people who were mic'd up? Yeah, people mic'd. Our sound designer, Wylie Stateman, is phenomenal ... his crew of sound freaks just go out and recreate these sounds. Taylor Kitsch is really good in this movie. I feel he got some heat for \"John Carter\" and your last film, \"Battleship.\" I don't know how you feel about that ... Look, I love Taylor Kitsch. I'll work with him as long as he'll work with me. You know, he had a rough year. Anybody who has a career in this business is going to have highs and lows. He was thrust into two big budget features. Jettisoned into these two huge films, which, you know, had mixed results, obviously. But the thing I like about him is that he never looked back. He never complained. He never felt sorry for himself. He said, \"What's next? Let's keep working.\" Of all of your films, are you most proud of \"Lone Survivor\"? I'm very proud of it. It hasn't come out yet, but I feel like, in some ways, it has. I've never had such a satisfied experience making a film. I have been in the minority as supporter of \"Battleship,\" but I have wondered if you were you surprised that it didn't do well? You know, it was obvious early on that there was a large majority of critics that had it out for that film, based on just concept alone. I wasn't completely shocked that we had trouble performing domestically. The film performed very well internationally. You know, it is what it is. I still quote \"Mahalo, bitch.\" Wait, no ... [Laughs] \"Mahalo, motherfucker!\" Of course I get it wrong in front of you. And we had a 90-year-old Navy vet who says, \"Let's drop some lead on these motherfuckers.\" That was my favorite line. That was his line, too, \"Let's drop some lead on these motherfuckers!\" I've grown an appreciation for your first movie, \"Very Bad Things,\" since I first saw it. I get reactions a lot from people who just found it. Generally, what's consistent is there's a very, very strong reaction. It's very polarizing. People either got it and went with it, or they were just completely repulsed by it. It was my first film and I was very creatively reckless and was doing anything I wanted to do. But creatively reckless can be a good thing. Oh, I think so, too. I look at \"The Hangover\" and I look at us as the grandfather of \"The Hangover.\" When you first saw \"The Hangover,\" did you feel like you had already made that movie? I mean, I think \"The Hangover\" was really funny. Bradley Cooper in \"The Hangover\" is more likable than Christian Slater in \"Very Bad Things.\" A little bit, yeah. We pushed it. I knew \"Very Bad Things\" was going to be an interesting ride when, at the first screening, people were laughing so hard. I've never heard people laugh that hard. Then, in the middle of it, this woman got up and kind of ran out of the theater and a guy was chasing after her. I walked out and there was this woman bent over a garbage can about to get sick. Her husband was standing next to her and I was kind of like, \"Is she OK?\" And the husband looked at me, \"No. She's not OK. Please stay back.\" Did they know that you were the director? No. But I can hear laughter coming from inside the theater and this woman is getting sick in a garbage can. And I was like, \"Gah. This is going to be a tricky one.\" Westwood. This was in Westwood. I know you were a producer on the \"Friday Night Lights\" television show and directed a couple of episodes. It doesn't happen very often that a television show overshadows the movie. Maybe \"overshadow\" isn't the right word. No, it overshadowed the movie. Is that weird for you? There are moments when I'll be with Garrett Hedlund or Lucas Black or Billy Bob Thornton -- and we'll talk about it and we're like, \"Hey, we did a movie, right?\" Like, \"We did do that movie!\" I mean, I don't feel bad about it. I always felt that one of the frustrating things about doing that movie was there was so much in Buzz Bissinger's book that made that movie work that we weren't able to fit into the movie. It talked a lot about racism, it talked a lot about academics and how we allocate money to schools and how much money goes to athletic programs versus academic programs -- religion and abortion and all of these themes were in the book. So, we felt like one of the reasons we did the show was I felt there was a lot more to discuss. So, I kind of look at it all as one big experience. You know, the football [action] in the movie was better than anything we were ever able to do on the TV show, but that's sort of what we were focused on. So, I'm happy. I'm happy that the whole \"Friday Night Lights\" experience has landed like it has.", "Most staple removers fit in the palm of your hand. This one would fill your living room and uses robotics and artificial intelligence. Ripcord, a startup backed with a $9.5 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has created a machine its founders think is key to solving a huge problem faced by companies as they try to access data that hasn\u2019t made it into the information age \u2013 billions of boxes of paper files. ``We\u2019re drowning in problem,\u2019\u2019 said co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Fielding. ``The issue is not demand.\u2019\u2019 Like many Silicon Valley start ups, Ripcord believes its technology is the answer to a prosaic problem. While the internet has been around for more than 20 years, the amount of printing done by companies is still increasing. All of those forms, invoices, reports and receipts typically end up in boxes in warehouses, where the data sit and are either useless or require a lot of time and money to access. Ripcord\u2019s machine aims to take away much of the labor of turning that paper into usable electronic information. The first problem most people face when they\u2019re armed with a computer and even the fastest desk-top scanner is how paper files are attached to each other. The company reckons that it takes the average person six to eight hours to scan a box of papers. Much of the time goes to removing staples and other fasteners that cause the dreaded paper jams. A chunk more time is wasted on the categorization and naming of files in the computer. With billions of boxes of files in storage across the U.S. alone, that\u2019s a lot of hours of work and paper cuts. Ripcord\u2019s machine takes stacks of paper, pulls out any staples and loads them one sheet at a time onto a conveyor belt for rapid scanning, up to one sheet a second. That seemingly inane task is done at breakneck speed by a combination of industrial robot and sensors all powered by artificial intelligence software. Ripcord isn\u2019t just processing paper and putting it into boxes. It\u2019s offering a service where it charges as little as 0.4 cents a sheet per month for scanning and uploading to the cloud in formats that its customers can access and integrate into other commonly used corporate computer systems. It also stores the information for them. The goal: all that paper comes out of the machine and goes into the shredder for recycling. Warehousing paper information is a $25 billion annual market, according to Hayward, California-based Ripcord. The machines aren\u2019t going on sale. Ripcord is aiming to deploy hundreds of the giant devices in warehouses where hoppers of paper will be moved around by robots. Fielding is keen to point out that his automated system isn\u2019t putting people out of work, it\u2019s going to change the way that filing work is done. The machines still need human input in preparing files and supervision of the speedy process, even though it has built-in error correction and will even divert through a trap door multiple sheets or paper with sticky notes attached. \"We\u2019re not replacing people with machines, we\u2019re giving them much more interesting things to do,\" Fielding said. \"I don't think anyone went to college to become a human staple remover.\"", "\u00a9 BWFolsom/iStock/Getty Images There are few pleasures in life greater than a deep, restful sleep. Seriously, if we could go back in time and tell our 5-year-old selves not to complain about nap time , we would. But there are lots of things that can throw you off your nighttime game. If you have regular trouble catching z's, you've probably looked into taking melatonin supplements. After all, there are countless bottles stocking drugstore shelves. How much do you really know about them, though? What Is Melatonin? For starters, melatonin is a For starters, melatonin is a hormone released by the brain that helps regulate the body's circadian rhythm (aka your internal clock), explains David Lee, MD, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the UCSF Fresno Medical Education Program. \"It's secreted by the pineal gland, which is at the base of the brain, and regulated by light,\" he says. \"It's a natural hormone that makes us sleep, and the moment the light goes away, like in the evening, that's when our peak melatonin [is produced].\" Are Melatonin Pills Really Safe? Since they aren't regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, it might be hard to tell if there are preservatives and additives in the pills you're taking, says Sanjeev Kothare, MD, a professor in the department of neurology and director of the pediatric sleep program at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"Some [users] have experienced a little bit of Since they aren't regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, it might be hard to tell if there are preservatives and additives in the pills you're taking, says Sanjeev Kothare, MD, a professor in the department of neurology and director of the pediatric sleep program at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"Some [users] have experienced a little bit of allergic reactions , not from the melatonin, but from the preservatives or additives,\" he says. (Lee emphasizes that it's important to always buy the supplement from a reputable company, avoiding herbal remedy peddlers.) Kothare says animal studies have linked melatonin to Kothare says animal studies have linked melatonin to depression , reproductive issues, and immunological problems. While these results haven't been replicated in humans, there also haven't been any good studies showing the long-term safety of melatonin pills, says Kothare. Still, Lee adds that no serious side effects have been reported. Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a Still, Lee adds that no serious side effects have been reported. Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a headache , or experience some short-term memory loss. \"Those are the common but pretty mild side effects,\" he says. The important thing, Lee points out, is to take the correct amount. \"The biggest myth out there, especially for \"The biggest myth out there, especially for insomnia , is that more is better,\" says Lee. In fact, when it comes to melatonin, less is actually more because your body already makes it. He suggests taking 0.5 milligrams if you do decide to try it. If that dosage amount is difficult to track down, buy 1 milligram pills and cut them in half. The bottom line: Unfortunately, there's not enough solid research out there on whether melatonin supplements are truly an effective and safe way to get to sleep. If you're still struggling to reach dreamland, Kothare has several other suggestions: Try to maintain a similar sleep schedule during the week and on weekends, limit the use of electronics that emit blue light for 1 to 2 hours before bedtime, and purchase a bright light source for use in the mornings to help regulate your body's internal clock.

This signifies that the country is in a state of war, noted the Philippine Star, which spotted the blunder. The banner was designed as a celebration of Philippine Independence Day, making the snafu doubly awkward. \"Happy Independence Day!

Young (R-Ind.) thanks supporters after winning his race at an election night rally in Indianapolis on Tuesday. (Michael Conroy/AP) The Senate will remain in Republican control, after Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) beat out his Democratic challenger, Jason Kander, dashing the Democrats\u2019 hopes of a return to power in Congress next year. The House will also remain in Republican control next year, after Democrats made only modest pickups there. While a couple of races were still outstanding as of 5:30 a.m. Wednesday, Republican wins in competitive states left no viable pathway for Senate Democrats to seize control from the GOP, despite earlier polling that suggested they were likely to do so. Under a Donald Trump presidency, a Republican Congress and White House will be able to attempt sweeping rollbacks of President Obama\u2019s landmark policies, including the health-care law known as Obamacare and last year\u2019s nuclear deal struck with Iran. The Senate Democrats\u2019 threat of a filibuster would, in many instances, be the only viable way to block such legislative efforts. Democrats had to pick up at least four seats if Hillary Clinton became president, and five under Trump, to seize the Senate majority. They never came close. [Trump\u2019s White House win promises to reshape U.S. political landscape] Democrats picked up only one seat, in Illinois, where current Rep. Tammy Duckworth unseated incumbent Republican Sen. Mark Kirk. Of the competitive races, it was the seat most likely to flip to Democratic control. Democrats also won a competitive Senate race in Nevada, where former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto beat Republican Rep. Joseph J. Heck. But the seat, which is being vacated by retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid, already belonged to Democrats. Democrats maintained a shot early Wednesday at eking out a victory in New Hampshire, where Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan were running neck-and-neck with almost 90 percent of precincts reporting. But elsewhere, Democrats did not score the victories they had hoped for. In Pennsylvania, Republican incumbent Sen. Patrick J. Toomey flouted almost all polling in the days before the election showing him closely losing to his Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, while in Wisconsin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson defeated former senator and favored Democratic candidate Russ Feingold to hold onto his seat. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr prevailed after coming under a serious challenge from Democrat Deborah Ross, holding an important seat for the GOP. Burr, the Senate\u2019s top Republican on intelligence matters, including cybersecurity, has comfortably kept his seat for two terms. Democrats had hoped to oust him in a wave of swing-state victories to take back the Senate majority. Democrats also suffered losses in other Senate races they had sought to contest more closely during the campaign season. Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain cruised to an easy victory Tuesday night over his Democratic challenger, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, despite months of polls showing the two were neck-and-neck. McCain had broken ahead of Kirkpatrick in the most recent polls, but the race was still considered to be among the more competitive ones in the country. And in Indiana, Republican Rep. Todd C. Young beat Democrat Evan Bayh, who served two terms in the Senate and hails from one of Indiana\u2019s most powerful political families. He was recruited as one of the Democrats\u2019 stronger candidates but ultimately fell short against Young, a three-term congressman from the southern part of the state. The Fix's Chris Cillizza breaks down why Republican Todd Young's win in Indiana's Senate race is important. Young defeated Democrat Evan Bayh, a former Indiana governor who held the Senate seat for 12 years. (The Washington Post) In Florida, Republican Marco Rubio, who ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign earlier this year, was also reelected to his Senate seat Tuesday night, keeping it in the GOP\u2019s column as he overcame a challenge from Democrat Rep. Patrick Murphy. House races in Florida yielded mixed results. Florida Democrat Stephanie Murphy staged an upset against one of the GOP\u2019s veteran members, Republican John L. Mica, who has held his seat since 1993. Mica\u2019s race in part was fueled by redistricting that led to a defeat for the normally safe incumbent, who ultimately lost by nearly three points. Republican Marco Rubio celebrates winning his Senate re-election bid in Florida, beating Democrat Patrick Murphy. (Reuters) Democrats also picked up a House seat in Florida from Republican Rep. David Jolly, who lost his reelection battle to former Florida governor Charlie Crist. Crist, who was a Republican and an independent while governor, joined the Democratic Party in 2012. But Democrats lost the House seat being vacated by Patrick Murphy \u2014 who lost to Rubio in the Senate race \u2014 when Florida Republican Brian Mast defeated Democrat Randy Perkins. In Virginia, Republicans also overcame a Democratic effort to oust Rep. Barbara Comstock, who easily rode to a nine-point victory over Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett. In general, House Democrats were frustrated and disappointed at less-than-expected gains. [Map: House of Representatives results] Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) blamed FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s decision late last month to tell Congress about possible new information pertaining to the Clinton email probe. Many Democrats had charged that Comey\u2019s decision was politically motivated, and Pelosi said Tuesday that it had a \"definite impact\" on Democrats\u2019 efforts to seize more congressional seats. In the House, it was possible that Democrats could knock out one of the GOP\u2019s chief attack dogs against the Obama administration in California\u2019s Darrell Issa, who as the former chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was banging the GOP\u2019s Benghazi drum before there was a Benghazi committee. If Issa loses to Democrat Doug Applegate, a former Marine colonel whose camp has ridiculed Issa\u2019s recent attempts to recast himself as a friend of the Obama administration, it could be the Democrats\u2019 biggest House upset of the night. Some Democratic gains came in urban areas where Trump\u2019s candidacy created negative headwinds: In Illinois\u2019s 10th, Rep. Bob Dold (R) lost to Democratic challenger, former congressman Brad Schneider, while in New Jersey\u2019s 5th District, Rep. Scott Garrett (R) lost to Democratic challenger Joshua Gottheimer. But in Iowa\u2019s 1st District \u2014 another bellwether \u2014 Republican Rep. Rod Blum held out against Democratic challenger Monica Vernon. Other competitive House races were all over the country, from New Hampshire to Nevada. The race in New Hampshire\u2019s 1st District was called after 4 a.m. Wednesday, with former Democratic congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter defeating incumbent Republican Frank Guinta. In Nevada\u2019s 3rd District, Democrat Jacky Rosen defeated Republican Danny Tarkanian, while in the 4th District, Democrat Ruben Kihuen beat incumbent Republican Rep. Cresent Hardy. In general, Democrats performed better in Nevada, which boasts a large Latino voting population, than they did nationwide. Early Wednesday morning returns were inconclusive in Minnesota\u2019s 2nd District, where Democrats backing Angie Craig tried to link Republican talk radio host Jason Lewis to Trump over his comments about \"not-thinking\" women and \"cultural suicide\" by the \"white population.\" One of them will replace outgoing Rep. John Kline (R). In the Senate, meanwhile, the parties held onto their seats in other high-profile races. Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who just a few months ago was on the shortlist of incumbents most in danger of losing their seats, was reelected to a second term in one of the earliest races to be called Tuesday night. And in Iowa, Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley won a seventh term over Democrat Patty Judge, despite earlier fears that his tenure was in jeopardy. [Map: Senate results] In Maryland, Democrat Chris Van Hollen was elected to his first term as a U.S. senator in the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D), while in California, Democrat Kamala Harris was elected to her first term in the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer (D). Democratic Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), who is expected to replace Reid as the Senate\u2019s top Democrat next year, won a fourth term, while Washington Democrat Patty Murray, also a member of the leadership team, won her fifth term. The Senate\u2019s No. 3 Republican, John Thune (S.D.), was reelected to his third. In Georgia, Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson was reelected to a third term in a race against Democratic challenger Jim Barksdale. While Isakson was not in grave danger of losing his seat, it was not clear that he would pass an important 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff until the last days of the election. Elsewhere in the Senate, Vermont\u2019s Democratic Sen. Patrick J. Leahy was reelected to his eighth term, while Alabama Republican Sen. Richard C. Shelby won his sixth, and Idaho Republican Mike Crapo won his fourth. Republicans Tim Scott of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii were reelected to their first full terms in the Senate, while Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republicans Rand Paul (Ky.), Mike Lee (Utah), Jerry Moran (Kan.), John Boozman (Ark.), and John Hoeven (N.D.) each won a second Senate term. Colorado Democrat Michael F. Bennet was also reelected to his second full Senate term, while Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden was reelected to his fourth full term. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was reelected to her third full term, while the Senate race to replace outgoing Sen. David Vitter (R) in Louisiana will head to a December runoff between Republican John Kennedy and Democrat Foster Campbell. The outcome of that runoff, in which the Republican is favored, will not affect which party holds the majority in the Senate. Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.", "Tech savvy . Culturally aware . Underemployed . Spiritual but not religious . These are all words and phrases that have come to be associated with the \"Milliennial Generation,\" which is also sometimes referred to as Generation Y. Recently, however, two additional adjectives have worked their way into the Millennial description pool: stressed and sleepless . The correlation between stress and sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly apparent in American society. NPR maintains that 60 million Americans are currently battling insomnia. According to an American Psychological Association study titled Stress in America , more than 50 percent of Millennials report to having been kept awake at least one night over the course of the past month due to stress. This is comparable to only 37 percent of Baby Boomers and 25 percent of Matures. Why does stress affect sleep? Stress is widely recognized as the body\u2019s response to potentially harmful situations, whether real or imagined. Although the effects of stress most certainly vary from person to person, general reactions include quickened breathing, tightened muscles, spiked blood pressure, and an increased heart rate. Fight or Flight or... Sleep? These are, in short, all individual components of the body\u2019s intrinsic and universally acknowledged \"fight-or-flight\" response. Many stressed out people have trouble falling asleep because they feel the weight of these symptoms most heavily at night. Best-selling author Dr. Andrew Weil, who received his M.D. from Harvard University in 1968, is a huge advocate of the benefits of holistic breathing practices in combatting stress and anxiety. On his website , Dr. Weil writes: \"Breathing strongly influences physiology and thought processes, including moods. By simply focusing your attention on your breathing, and without doing anything to change it, you can move in the direction of relaxation.\" Because the effects of stress include quick and shallow breaths that stem almost exclusively from the upper chest, perpetually stressed and anxious people are actually in the detrimental habit of under-breathing. Many stressed people are even known for subconsciously holding their breath. That being said, mindful breathing practices are noticeably absent from the vast majority of Western medicine. Those most familiar with the relationship between breathing and the body tend to be yogis and practitioners of Eastern wellness methodologies. How to Do The \"4-7-8\u2032\u2032 Exercise Dr. Weil is an influential public supporter of a previously little-known breathing technique known as the \"4-7-8 exercise.\" This trick, which began to capture national attention several years ago and has since been the subject of innumerable headlines, including one on Oprah.com , is shockingly simple, takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere. Here is how you do the exercise: Place the tip of your tongue against the tissue ridge right above your upper front teeth. Keep it there for the remainder of the exercise. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you do so. Close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four. Hold your breath for a mental count of seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight. Make the same whoosh sound from Step Two. This concludes the first cycle. Repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions. In a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. You must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. The four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen. The seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs. Alina Gonzalez, who wrote \" How I Learned to Fall Asleep in Under 1 Minute \" for Byrdie.com, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend\u2019s wedding. When Gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life. It did. Like so many others who swear by this method, the originally skeptical Gonzalez wakes up each morning to the incredulous realization that s he does not even remember completing the final 4-7-8 cycle because it put her to sleep so quickly. The 4-7-8 exercise certainly has the potential to help overly stressed, anxiety-ridden Millennials (as well as members of the general population at large) fall asleep more quickly. It is also known to have positive effects when implemented throughout the day during times of stress, anger, guilt, frustration, or internal tension. When weighing the painlessness of this completely free method against the irritability, headaches, distractedness, impaired cognitive skills, weight gain, and even heart disease that can result from the \"performance killer\" known as sleep deprivation, it seems worth a shot.", "During oral arguments on an affirmative action case on Tuesday, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said the 14th Amendment protects everyone, not \"only the blacks.\" The quote was tweeted by the New York Times' David Leonhardt: Scalia: \"The 14th Amendment protects all races\" -- not \"only the blacks.\" \u2014 David Leonhardt (@DLeonhardt) October 15, 2013 The high court debated Tuesday whether voters can ban affirmative action programs through a referendum.

In February 2013, Scalia suggested that the continuation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act represented the \"perpetuation of racial entitlement,\" saying that lawmakers had only voted to renew the act in 2006 because there wasn't anything to be gained politically from voting against it.", "Just one week of tracking every penny in and out of my life was enlightening, but maybe not in the way you\u2019d expect.

Yes, the rent & utilities were significantly cheaper in the latter ($13,500 vs. $17,700 living alone), but living with roommates brings in additional expenses: \u2022 Cleaning was difficult, so we got a housekeeper (-$650/year), \u2022 My groceries went up because not everything gets split perfectly and food & supplies might \"go missing\" (-$250/year), \u2022 Restaurant expenses increased because I was around more friends and acquaintances and was pressured to go out with them (-$750/year), \u2022 I spent a lot more on \"gifts\" (-$500/year) Adding those factors in, I was still saving $2,000/year on rent, but that only equates to $166/month, which I probably could\u2019ve negotiated when I lived alone, or found a comparable apartment for that much less. Also, I wasn\u2019t sharing a kitchen, family room space, and parking \u2014 instead, when I was living alone, I used every square inch of my apartment and lived on my own terms. If you\u2019re deciding to live with roommates, these are things to consider. Is it worth it to save $100-200 on rent to deal with the complexities of having one or more roommates? For many people, like me, that extra cost makes sense ... or maybe you\u2019re an extrovert and simply love having people around. 2. Having a significant other has been expensive for me How does your relationship status affect your finances? Here\u2019s how it affected mine. When I was single, I spent somewhere around $1,000/year on gifts, but once I was in a relationship this more than tripled! It didn\u2019t mean I was spending a lot more on my girlfriend, necessarily, but when you\u2019re a couple, you get invited to all sorts of engagement parties, weddings, birthdays, baby showers, and more, and you\u2019ll likely be chipping in for the gifts as well. Add in gifts for your significant other and his or her family, and it\u2019s easy to see that you\u2019ll be spending much more than normal. But that\u2019s not all. While your groceries and restaurant expenses could stay the same if everything is split evenly, you\u2019ll likely attend more events as a couple, so it\u2019s safe to assume that expenses will go up in multiple ways. For me, the gifts category was the most noticeable: I spent a whopping $3,600 in gifts in 2015 compared to $765 in 2010. While a good portion of the gifts went to family, I dove in to the line level and found that this was indeed mostly due to the change in relationship status. 3. Cat ownership isn\u2019t as expensive as I thought This clearly depends on your parenting preferences, but luckily, I\u2019ve done it both ways: In 2014, I was very relaxed with my cat \u2014 maybe 1 vet appointment, she was fed dry kibble, and she didn\u2019t need a litter box because she went outside. She was also old enough that she didn\u2019t need toys and distractions. Cat-related expenses were very minimal. Cat bills in 2014: $312 Compare that with the very next year, when I took a more proactive approach: I fed her high-quality, raw cat food and had a couple of her broken teeth extracted by the vet\u2019s recommendation. Cat bills in 2015: $1,375 That\u2019s a $1,000 difference, but even in the more expensive case, $115/month, or less than $4 a day, to give my cat the best and have a furry friend around was worth it for me. 4. 'Gold' or 'Platinum' health insurance hasn't been worth it Being self-employed is expensive. It feels much worse than receiving a paycheck from a company because I have to pay quarterly taxes on my income, which is about a third of my earnings. On top of that, I have to pay for my own health insurance. As a hypochondriac, I opted for the \"Gold\" plan, thinking that it would be better long-term. But just 3 years after quitting my steady job, I\u2019m worth $8,800 less due to monthly health insurance costs, and to add insult to injury, I\u2019ve only used my \"awesome\" gold plan a couple of times. Average cost per year: $3,500, or roughly 10% of my total expenses 5. Tax season is not only a breeze, but also fun! I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll hear this anywhere else... Ignoring quarterly taxes, I enjoy tax season. This is what it consists of: Sort my spreadsheet by date and category, Eliminate the categories that aren\u2019t applicable, Send it to my accountant Done. This whole process takes a few minutes and it\u2019s fun to see the year as a whole. 6. Despite the odds of winning, playing the lottery makes sense (to me) Everyone has their opinion on this, and mine is somewhere in the middle. I only play the lottery if the expected return is greater than the cost of the ticket. Basic math shows that your odds of winning the lottery, or at least matching all the numbers, are horrific. But basic math also shows that when the lottery reaches certain thresholds, your expected return is actually really good when you take into account the smaller prizes. On top of that, the law of utility makes a great case: even if you played $1 on the lottery twice a week, you\u2019d only be spending around $100/year. Is that going to ruin your finances? Probably not if you\u2019re reading this article. However, if you won, would it affect your life? Most definitely... and that\u2019s why I play. The lottery also gives back to schools which I like. As for the numbers, I\u2019ve spent less than $400 in 6 years on the lottery and won back 10%. Is $1 a week worth a chance to win $100,000,000 or even $1,000,000,000? For me it is. 7. The juicy details aren't really that juicy The numbers are fun and tracking finances to this level of detail makes tax season enjoyable, but to me, the biggest impact of this experiment has been my attitude. Just one week of tracking every penny in and out of my life was enlightening, but maybe not in the way you\u2019d expect. I thought I\u2019d find insights about the actual data and where I could save money, and while that was somewhat true, the bigger lesson was one of awareness. Every time I spent any amount of money, I was thinking about my new spreadsheet: the fact I\u2019d have to spend time updating my table for this trivial purchase, what it would mean to my balance, and if this expense was actually \"worth it.\" This simple homework assignment threw me out of \"auto-consumption\" mode and made me question every purchase I made. It\u2019s like a meditative practice for minimalists. After 6 years of doing this, that awareness is stronger than ever. I know what I can afford. I know what it\u2019ll mean if I make a large purchase or if I take on a new monthly expense. It\u2019s easy to see how this will impact my bottom line and my future finances.", "No one has ever, in the history of men, lied about dick size. Sorry. That was a lie. Speaking of lies, the holy Bro Bible got the scoop from SaucyDates.com on how exaggerated penis size claims vary from country to country. And wouldn't you believe the United States is a frontrunner in the race to bullshit? Canada and India lead the way in modesty, while Australia and the United States are all about heavy exaggeration: Globally, according to the Saucy team, men boast about their fabricated seven-inch dicks enough to earn a worldwide exaggeration average of 5.6 percent. But not all havers of dicks are lying: When a man has a length of 8 inches or more, it would suggest he has sufficient confidence in his size that he tells the truth. Whereas, men below 5.5 inches lack that confidence and exaggerate their size. Fair enough. The Saucy report also recommends that those seeking a reasonable penis \"play it safe\" with Canada, while avoiding Americans and Australians altogether.  Regardless of the size of one's lying penis, here's another thing to keep in mind: Your cracked iPhone might be sabotaging your chances at intimacy. \"Singles don't like people who have a cracked phone, or an old phone, or those who use a clicking sound when typing,\" Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist who helped develop a recent Singles in America study, told USA Today last month. \"I think we will see more of these taboos as singles are leading the way in expressing new forms of politeness in the technological era.\" Also, at least one Republican wants everyone to choose between replacing that cracked phone and procuring health insurance. There is, we can now confirm, no hope in modern life.", "The gulf in American politics between the left and the right can seem insurmountable. There are red states and blue states, liberal media sources and conservative media sources, even jobs and names that differ by political party. Research has suggested that liberals and conservatives even wash with different shampoos and soaps and thus have different smells. But actually, millions of Americans cross that gulf every day \u2014 by being married to someone of a different political party. In a new paper, two researchers examined American couples to see how common \"mixed\" political marriages really are. Eitan Hersh, a professor of political science at Yale University, and Yair Ghitza, a chief scientist at political data firm Catalist, studied a database of more than 18 million couples drawn from voter registration records. They found that most married couples \u2014 70 percent of them \u2014 were made up of people of the same political affiliation (either Democratic, Republican or independent/other). Married couples overall were somewhat more likely to be Republicans than Democrats. But, as the graphic below shows, \"mixed\" political marriages certainly do happen. Three percent of married couples are female Republicans married to male Democrats (upper right rectangle), while 6 percent of married couples are male Republicans with female Democrats (lower left rectangle). So, overall, nearly 1 in 10 married couples contain both a Republican and a Democrat. Nineteen percent of married couples are a Republican or a Democrat with an independent. In total, nearly 30 percent of all married couples are of mixed party affiliation. Meanwhile, 30 percent of married couples were exclusively Republican, 25 percent of married couples were all Democrat, and 15 percent were all independent. Those findings might be surprising for people who are used to reading about America's divided politics, Hersh said. \"There\u2019s actually a lot of people all mixed up together in terms of their politics,\" Hersh said. Hersh and Ghitza also compared political affiliation to other factors that often guide people\u2019s choice of a marital partner \u2014 like age, race and geographical vicinity. Of course, all of these factors also have strong ties to a person\u2019s political affiliation. First, they found that marrying across political parties is far more common in the United States than marrying across racial categories. (This is partly due to the way political and racial categories are split up \u2014 America is majority white but not majority Democratic or Republican). In the United States, 71 percent of couples are in same-party marriages, compared with 93 percent in same-race marriages. Their research also supported previous findings that Democrats live in more partisan neighborhoods than Republicans do \u2014 partly due to concentrated African American communities, where most people are Democrats. In neighborhoods that were more than 90 percent Democratic, they found that 68 percent of households were made up of two Democrats. But in neighborhoods that were more than 90 percent Republican, only 55 percent of households were made up of two Republicans. Also in line with prior research, they found that men are more likely to be Republican. The study shows that there are twice as many Democratic-Republican households in which the husband is a Republican than in which the wife is a Republican. [There\u2019s a mathematical reason you\u2019re less popular than your friends] They also found that older couples were much more likely to be of the same political party than younger couples are. Among married couples under 30, fewer than half were Democrat-Democrat or Republican-Republican pairs, the researchers say. But among couples over 80, 70 percent were. This is partly because more young people are independents. You can see those trends in the chart below, which shows how the household party registration of married couples changes by age. The bands in the middle get narrower as you go from the left to the right, showing that, as people get older, fewer are independents or in \"mixed\" political marriages. Instead, Democrat-Democrat and Republican-Republican couples become more common as people age. The researchers say this could be due to the effects of cohabitation \u2014 after years of living together, one spouse may be persuaded to join the other\u2019s team. One of the paper\u2019s main findings is about political turnout in elections. It appears that your spouse\u2019s politics have a lot to do with your likelihood of getting out and voting on Election Day. Hersh says that effect was much larger than he expected. \"For two people who live in the same state, of the same age and race, if they\u2019re living with someone of their own party they\u2019re voting at much higher rates than if they\u2019re living with someone of a different party.\" But these trends vary depending on which specific parties you\u2019re talking about. For both Republicans and Democrats, for example, being married to an independent tends to depress the person\u2019s vote significantly more than being married to a person on the opposite side of the political spectrum. \"Being married to an independent, it brings down the turnout of the partisan, and it never brings up the turnout of the independent,\" he says. The graphic below shows the percentage drop in the likelihood of voting if one spouse has a different party registration from the other. In the 2012 primary, for example, a Democrat married to an independent or member of a third party was 13 percent less likely to vote than a Democrat married to another Democrat. As the graphic shows, being married to someone of a different party appeared to affect the vote of Republicans much more than Democrats, for unknown reasons. \"Depending on whether you\u2019re a Democrat, or a Republican or an independent, the effects vary a lot,\" Hersh said. \"And they\u2019re particularly strong for Republicans. A Republican married to a Democrat was 10 percentage points less likely to vote than a Republican married to a Republican. But a Democrat married to a Republican was only 3 percentage points less likely to vote than a Democrat married to a Democrat.\" The paper is designed to explain what precisely is happening, not why it\u2019s happening, so the researchers don\u2019t know exactly why a spouse\u2019s political party changes a person\u2019s likelihood of voting. But they speculate that the reason could be twofold: that people who are less politically active are more likely to marry outside of their own party and that living together might influence a person\u2019s politics and willingness to vote. Some people of different parties, for example, might have the feeling that their votes are \"canceling each other out\" and decide to stay at home on the sofa instead.

Shevchenko was at a restaurant, Campero\u2019s Chicken Grill, with her coach Pavel Fedotov, when a group of men stormed the place. The men demanded that any money on the premises be handed over, as well as personal belongings that the customers had on their person. The area is relatively known for high crime, in fact this was the fifth time that Campero\u2019s Chicken Grill has been robbed. It is believed that the men were extremely violent, beating people who refused to hand their personal belongings over. Reports have confirmed that Shevchenko\u2019s coach, Pavel Fedotov, was armed with a gun and decided to take matters into his own hands. Firing at the group of men, Fedotov allegedly killed one of the men. He was then shot himself in the stomach, where he was rushed to hospital for treatment. Video footage of the incident shows Shevchenko running to Fedotov\u2019s side to check he is okay. It\u2019s currently unclear what his condition is. Footage of the incident can be seen here. Fedotov is a muay thai veteran, who won gold last weekend at the World Muay Thai Championships in Sweden. He is also married to Shevchenko\u2019s sister, Antonina. Despite being relatively unknown in the MMA scene, Schevchenko\u2019s resume is jam packed with success. She has won gold at the IFMA World Championships nine times in the last 13 years. She holds an impressive 58-2 kickboxing record and a 12-2 mixed martial arts record. Her last fight was at UFC 196 where she lost to the now number one contender, Amanda Nunes. Shevchenko is scheduled to fight former UFC bantamweight champion Holly Holm on July 23 at UFC ON FOX 20. Given both women have extensive backgrounds in boxing and kickboxing, expect this fight to be full of striking and excitement. Should Shevchenko pull of a huge win against Holly Holm, she would leap into UFC title contendership almost instantly. Former champion, Holm, lost her UFC bantamweight title to Miesha Tate earlier this year at UFC 196. Holm won the UFC title in November at UFC 193, where she stunned the world by beating the formerly undefeated, Ronda Rousey.", "1. Downsize Your Home \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates downsize your home As boomers raised their families, the big house and spacious yard were perfect for those backyard soccer and football games. Now, with the kids grown and out of the house, chances are they\u2019re paying for space that they probably aren\u2019t using. For most people, a home is the biggest expense. Add mortgage payments, utilities, property taxes and maintenance, and you\u2019re shelling out a lot of cash. Even if the mortgage is paid off, the property taxes, repairs and maintenance never go away. One of the best baby boomer saving tips is to downsize by moving to a smaller home, condo or possibly a rental apartment. But just downsizing isn\u2019t enough. The baby boomer saver won\u2019t benefit if she doesn\u2019t do something smart with her savings. You need to be deliberate and take the actual amount you\u2019re saving, and put that money aside \u2014 in an IRA, Roth IRA, 401k or savings account \u2014 and designate it for retirement. If not, you\u2019re likely to spend the savings, which won\u2019t help your retirement at all. 2. Ditch the Luxury Car \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates downgrade your car The second-biggest money drain for most people is a vehicle, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Your vehicle drains an average of $8,558 each year from your budget, according to a recent AAA survey. In a year, you\u2019ll shell out for car payments, insurance, gas, repairs and maintenance. If you\u2019re driving to impress with a lean retirement pocketbook, you might want to consider selling your vehicle for a low-cost-to-own model. Luxury cars are much more expensive to own than their non-luxury counterparts, according to vehicle valuation guide Kelly Blue Book. The lowest cost-to-own luxury model was the Volvo S80 T5, at $52,104 for five years. In comparison, the 2016 Honda Accord LX was the lowest cost-to-own standard model, costing $31,587 over five years. That\u2019s a more than $20,000 difference between a standard and a luxury model. If you trade down to a standard-model vehicle, keep it a long time and you could save an average of $4,000 per year. That could help a 52-year-old baby boomer amass an extra $80,000 by age 72. If you invest that $4,000 every year in a balanced index fund that earns 7 percent annually, the savings would be worth $184,296 after 20 years. 3.

But if you\u2019re a baby boomer who\u2019s serious about saving for retirement, there\u2019s proof that getting healthy can help. If you live a healthy lifestyle, you\u2019re more likely to save money on a litany of costs, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Medical costs will decline, you\u2019ll save money on expensive vices such as smoking and drinking, you\u2019ll spend less money on prescription drugs and over-the-counter fixes and your food budget will drop.

Aggressively Save for Retirement \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates save for retirement If you didn\u2019t save and invest when you were younger, forget about it. Concentrate instead on what you can do now, and max out every possible savings and investing option you have. Even if you\u2019re in your 50s and plan to retire in a decade or so, remember that you\u2019ll still have many ensuing years for your money to grow and compound. It\u2019s not as if you turn 66, quit your job and then immediately spend all of your savings. The spend-down portion of your retirement is gradual. You can take advantage of the \"catch-up\" provisions in your IRA and 401k accounts. You\u2019re allowed to contribute an additional $6,000 extra in 2016 to your 401k if you\u2019re over age 50, and up to $1,000 extra to a traditional or Roth IRA. By maxing out all of your retirement options, and letting those dollars grow and compound in the investment markets, you could boost your retirement pot substantially over the ensuing decades. 7. Pay Down Your Mortgage \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates pay off mortgage You can You can pay your mortgage off faster if you add an extra principal payment to your mortgage sum monthly. This can ultimately help boost your retirement savings. For example, say you have a $200,000 30-year mortgage, with a 3.9 percent fixed interest rate and 20 years remaining until the debt is paid off. If you add an extra $300 principal payment per month, you will save $23,910 in interest and pay off your mortgage six years and five months early.

Now, a promotional email from the company has ripped the lid off Valve\u2019s plans for 2016. This year\u2019s Steam summer sale will get underway on June 23, as per an email distributed to PayPal account holders over the past week. \"Now you know when it\u2019s going to happen,\" reads the accompanying message \"you can get ready for the savings.\" While in previous years PayPal has let the cat out of the bag without Valve\u2019s say-so, it seems that the company was given the go-ahead this time around. The email makes reference to the exclusive nature of the reveal, and a tweet promoting the announcement tagged the official Steam account, according to a report from Tech Spot. This news seems to confirm previous reports that the 2016 summer sale would run from June 23 to July 4. In May, a developer using the handle MrFreemanBBQ posted a screenshot of communication from Valve referencing those dates \u2014 along with a message warning recipients to keep this \"confidential\" information secret \u2014 to the Steam subreddit.

I think it is out of respect.", "Well, I guess it was good while it lasted, but apparently all things must come to an end; or quite possibly just a revamped beginning. Pokemon has been around for what seems like forever, well actually 20 years now. For some of you readers, Pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering I played link-battles on the school bus with my friends. With Nintendo's upcoming release of two new Pokemon titles, Pokemon Sun and Moon, I don't think they ever thought that their beloved games would wind up getting so complicated. But when you starting renaming one of the most famous characters in the franchise, it's easy to see why things are getting so complicated. With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see: Now Nintendo wants to unify them: Poke\u0301mon in Greater China will be officially called \u7cbe\u9748\u5bf6\u53ef\u5922, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Poke\u0301mon). Earlier in Hong Kong, it was \u5bf5\u7269\u5c0f\u7cbe\u9748 Pet Little Elves (or Spirits), while in Taiwan, it was \u795e\u5947\u5bf6\u8c9d, Magic Babies. This probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists. Hong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin. Because Pokemon Sun and Moon will be translated into Mandarin now, it's causing a stir because Pikachu now has a new name! That's Right, I said it, Pikachu is now Pikaqiu Pikachu was originally translated as \u6bd4\u5361\u8d85 (Bei-kaa-chyu) in Hong Kong. Now it is named \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 (Pikaqiu). While the name \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 in Mandarin sounds similar to the global name Pikachu (as it was always called in China and Taiwan), it reads as Pei-kaa-jau in Cantonese, which doesn\u2019t sound the same at all. Fans of the bright electric mouse have been protesting NIntendo's translating choice saying that they will never buy from Nintendo again. Although the protest has gained over 6,000 signatures for a petition against the decision, it looks as though Nintendo is sticking with the new translation.", "More than 60 people died and thousands were forced to flee their villages when Hindu-Muslim riots erupted in two districts of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in 2013. The violence, sparked by the alleged harassment of a young Hindu woman by a Muslim man, lasted two days. A few days later, seven women, all Muslims, went to the police alleging that they were gang-raped during the violence that broke out in their villages. The police took a year to arrest all the 29 accused, who were later released on bail. The trials were supposed to be completed in special fast track courts within two months. But nearly four years on, the women are still waiting for justice. Amnesty International's Mariya Salim has worked on a report tracing the legal journey of the women and says there is a clear lack of will on the part of the administration to ensure they get justice. \"Research tells us that there have been only three convictions in rape cases during Hindu-Muslim communal riots since the country's partition, and that hasn't changed even now. We have seen delays at every stage\", Ms Salim says. The BBC's Divya Arya travelled to the area to listen to the women's stories. Rubina \"No video recording and no photos on the internet,\" was how Rubina greeted me when I visited her new home, 30km from the village where she lived before the riots. In the aftermath, many Muslims were forced to leave and settle elsewhere. The Muzaffarnagar-Shamli districts are now dotted with ghettos, where those displaced by the riots have bought land and constructed houses after the Supreme Court directed the state government to pay them compensation. Rubina is a middle-aged woman. She stood before me with a baby resting on her elbow and shoulders and two young children tugging at her tunic. \"I am tired of having my grandchildren complain to my daughter that they are humiliated at school because some child saw their 'rape victim' grandmother's photo,\" she told me later. Rubina said she was gang raped by four men, including her neighbours. \"I fell unconscious, and when I came to, I just ran, with everyone else in the village.\" They had no time to pack or take any money with them. Together they lived in relief camps for months on end. Shared trauma and difficult circumstances bred strength and sisterhood. But then there were the threats. \"The accused threatened to kill my children, so I once retracted my statement, but after my husband and lawyer reassured me I testified before the judge with the complete truth.\" Charges have still not been framed in her case, despite her giving testimony, undergoing medical tests and attending endless rounds of court hearings. Rubina said she didn't see the point of continuing. Struggling to make ends meet, she feels uprooted and lost. \"All I've got is the tag of fallen woman, I'm exhausted. Why should I pursue the case?\" Nafeesa Just like the other alleged rape survivors, Nafeesa cannot read or write. \"I had only ever heard of the Delhi gang rape incident before my own rape, so I thought the accused would get punished as soon as I identified them in my complaint,\" she said. \"Little did I know these cases can take so long.\" Nafeesa grew quiet as if remembering that night all over again, where she says she was raped by five men, all known to her. She alleged they threatened to kill her two-year-old son to stop her screaming. Nafeesa now lives in a colony of the riot-displaced only 2km from her village. \"We would never go back there, there is nothing left for us, and they (Hindus) would dare not come here. We are safe here among people of our own religion,\" she said. But it's a tough life. Many of these colonies have no electricity connections, drainage or roads. Then she said: \"Sometimes I wonder why I filed this case. I haven't got any justice, and the threat to my life still remains.\" \"They [the accused men] live in their villages and roam free, they lost nothing; we lost everything.\" Khalida Her voice stood out clear, crisp and fresh. If there were any signs of fatigue with the long legal battle, she hid them well. \"I won't leave them unpunished\", she said over the phone. \"I haven't lost courage and I haven't forgotten anything, they will have to pay for my countless sleepless nights.\" Khalida is exceptionally brave. She has left Uttar Pradesh, where she alleges she was attacked by three men during the riots. They found her in fields where she had fled. She is now in hiding with her children, but I was able to speak to her after meeting her husband. He told me that the threats to their family are still grave and the pace of the trial very slow, so Khalida's lawyer has petitioned that her case be heard outside Uttar Pradesh. But that petition was filed a year ago and is still waiting to be heard. Just like the other women who have come forward, their livelihoods have also been disrupted by riots and fighting the rape case is as much a legal matter as it is a financial one. But Khalida's husband told me he'd go to any length to support his wife's quest for justice. As I began to hang up the phone, Khalida said: \"He is very fond of me... I'll continue to fight with his strength.\" Names of all the rape survivors have been changed", "The Coalition Mrs. Clinton can expect little if any opposition in the Democratic primaries.

This pizza is adapted from the recipe used by the staff at Roberta\u2019s restaurant in Brooklyn, who make their tomato sauce simply by whizzing together canned tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. The ingredients offer in their proportions what appears to be a kind of austerity \u2014 not even 3 ounces of cheese! But the result is home-cooked pizza to beat the band, exactly the sort of recipe to start a career in home pizza-making, and to return to again and again. Step 1 Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn heat to its highest setting. Let it heat for at least an hour. Step 2 Put the sauce in the center of the stretched dough and use the back of a spoon to spread it evenly across the surface, stopping approximately 1/2 inch from the edges. Step 3 Drizzle a little olive oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Scatter basil leaves over the top. Step 4 Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated stone or tiles in the oven.

In an op-ed published by The New York Times, Christopher Suprun, a paramedic in Texas, argued that the president-elect has demonstrated each day that \"he is not qualified for the office.\" Mr. Trump, Suprun wrote, has failed to unite the country as President George W. Bush did after 9/11. Instead, he has ranted and attacked the cast of NBC\u2019s \"Saturday Night Live.\" \"He tweets day and night, but waited two days to offer sympathy to the Ohio State community after an attack there. He does not encourage civil discourse, but chooses to stoke fear and create outrage,\" he wrote. \"This is unacceptable. For me, America is that shining city on a hill that Ronald Reagan envisioned. It has problems. It has challenges. These can be met and overcome just as our nation overcame Sept. 11.\" Suprun went on to say Mr. Trump \"lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief\" and lambasted him for how he \"urged violence against protesters at his rallies during the campaign. He speaks of retribution against his critics.\" He added that the election of Mr. Trump is \"not yet a done deal\" and he urged other electors to \"vote their conscience\" and unify behind a GOP alternative like Ohio Gov. John Kasich. While a few dozen states have laws that try to bind the votes of presidential electors, Texas is not one of them. Suprun would be known as a \"faithless elector\" and while there have been some in previous elections, they have never changed the outcome. Harvard University law professor Larry Lessig has announced that he will provide free counsel to electors who want to oppose  Mr.Trump, according to Politico. It\u2019s called \"The Electors Trust\" and it will offer a platform for electors to plan how to stop the president-elect.

Kathy and Brandon Gunn shared their story in a post on the \u2018Love What Matters\u2019 Facebook page. The couple says they received the gift from Kathy\u2019s great Aunt Alison. It was a plain white box with a card that read, \"Do not open until your 1st disagreement.\" The couple says they\u2019ve had plenty of those through the years, but they never opened the box. \"I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure,\" the post says. \"To us, it would have meant that we didn\u2019t have what it takes to make our marriage work \u2013 and we\u2019re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations.\" Recently, with a wedding coming up, the two sat down and tried to think of a gift for the newlyweds. They realized their favorite gift from their own wedding was the one they never opened. \"Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization,\" the post says. \"I realized that the tools for creating and maintaining a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box \u2013 they were within us.\" When the couple did open the gift, they found items like wine glasses and notes/money for Kathy and for Brandon. Brandon\u2019s note told him to use his money to buy flowers and wine. Kathy\u2019s note told her to buy pizza and get a bath ready. \"All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage \u2013 an age old trick \u2013 unbeknownst to us rookies,\" the post says. \"After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save \"us\" \u2013 and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all.\"", "There are 93 women who speak in the Bible, 49 of whom are named. These women speak a total of 14,056 words collectively -- roughly 1.1 percent of the total words in the holy book. These are the findings of the Rev. Lindsay Hardin Freeman, an Episcopal priest who three years ago embarked on an unprecedented project: to count all the words spoken by women in the Bible. With the help of three other women in her church community -- as well as highlighters, sticky notes and spreadsheets -- Freeman painstakingly dissected the Bible's New Revised Standard Version. \"I wanted to know what women in the Bible really said,\" Freeman told The Huffington Post. \"I was stunned to see that nobody had done this before.\" The women met in the basement of Trinity Episcopal Church in Excelsior, Minnesota, where Freeman served as rector at the time the project began. They worked to identify each woman who makes a speaking appearance in the Bible, how many words she utters and what her larger role is. Their efforts culminated in a final book, Bible Women: All Their Words and Why They Matter, which was published in September 2014. Some of the biblical women are prominent and well-known, like Jesus' mother, Mary, who utters just 191 words. Mary Magdalene says 61 words, while Sarah, the wife of Abraham, says 141. Many of the female characters in the Bible go through what Freeman called \"tremendous trauma,\" and have largely been silenced over the centuries. \"We have for whatever reason overlooked the witness of women in the Bible for all these thousands of years and all the contributions they've made to the faith and to world history,\" Freeman said. \"We are just finally finding out their stories.\" Freeman is also the author of The Scarlet Cord: Conversations With God's Chosen Women, which analyzed the stories of 12 women in the Bible. Greg Carey, a New Testament professor at Lancaster Theological Seminary, agreed with Freeman, and said her book performed \"a valuable service\" by elevating these women's stories. \"The Bible was written by men largely for men, and women's contributions are scattered pretty thinly through its pages,\" Carey told HuffPost. \"By bringing these women and their stories into one place, Freeman opens an opportunity for us to see them as a whole.\" Freeman dedicated one chapter to her book to each book of the Bible, and the chapters are further divided into sections for each woman who appears in a given book. In Genesis, for instance, Freeman and her team found that 11 women speak, compared to 50 men. Reading and analyzing the women's narratives brought their stories to life, Freeman said, and helped her start to see them as \"neighbors\" with important wisdom to offer. \"I think they have a lot to share with us about what it means to believe, what it means to have faith,\" Freeman reflected, noting the effect the work has had on her team. \"We have been transformed, our little group of four people,\" she said. \"We have cried over these stories, we have laughed over these stories. Our faith has been increased.\"", "Vans x Nintendo sneaker collection gets a release date. UPDATE: Vans x Nintendo collaboration are now on sale in the UK at this link.

Fuck for fun. Fuck for sport. Fuck for our ancestors who can\u2019t fuck anymore. Just keep pluggin\u2019, baby!\" But that\u2019s never the outcome. And this study is no different. Primarily because it asked the WRONG question about sex. More on that after you see the results. Per Independent: Ten is the ideal number of lovers to have had for both men and women, researchers have claimed. More than 1,000 people took part in the online survey for Britain\u2019s biggest extra-marital dating site IllicitEncouters.com, being asked how many lovers they would want a new partner to have had. Between eight and 12 was the most popular answer, chosen by 38 per cent of women and 37 per cent of men. You see, what they have concluded is the ideal number of partners we want the person we are having sex with to have had, NOT the ideal number we want. There is a big difference there. Of course no one wants to have sex with some chick who\u2019s fucked all 53 guys on an NFL roster, so naturally this number is going to be substantially lower than our own hopes and dreams. The study even concluded that... Any number above 20 was considered a turn-off, chosen by 3 per cent of women and 4 per cent of men. Yeah, dipshits, it is a turn-off to know that about a person, but is a guy who has slept with 100 chicks turned-off by his own actions? I highly doubt it. Unless, of course, he\u2019s acquired an STD or a one-night-stand child. Then, and only THEN, is when he will start to regret his past transgressions. But until that happens, his ideal number of sex partners will remain infinity.

In Swift\u2019s latest video, for \"I Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever\" with Zayn, she\u2019s smashing mirrors and wrecking hotel rooms, fueled by the torture of love. The visual for the duet, a cut from the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack, has Swift and Zayn at a standoff after a fight, taking out their frustrations on the furniture and champagne bottles around them. In short, the video\u2019s all about how fame, parties and lavish living can never fulfill someone more than love can. So why not destroy it all? But this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen Swift lash out in music videos. When the singer isn\u2019t demolishing the pop charts, she\u2019s taking aim at props in her vids -- and, man, does it make for juicy viewing. Let\u2019s take a look at all the times Swift has added an extra slice of drama to the scene by smashing something to bits. Item destroyed: A white rose Method of destruction: Idle plucking of petals Level of decimation: 1 Taylor makes a play on the age-old \"he loves me, he loves me not\" theme by angstily tugging at a white rose. Luxurious, yet tortured -- just the imagery to get the point across. Item destroyed: A full-length mirror Method of destruction: Chucking a UFO at it Level of decimation: 5 We\u2019re not sure what exactly that mirror did, but it got what was coming to it. Damn mirror. Item destroyed: A photo of her ex Method of destruction: Darts to the face Level of decimation: 2 Swift hires a secret service to do a number on her ex-boyfriend\u2019s place, and the first order of business is firing darts at his photo. After all, what\u2019s better than revenge? Item destroyed: A roll of toilet paper Method of destruction: A careless unfurling Level of decimation: 3 While she sits back and enjoys the trashing of her ex\u2019s apartment, rolls of TP whiz past her as she smirks with evil glee. Item destroyed: A bottle of mouthwash Method of destruction: Spittle Level of decimation: 4 Swift has one of her minions gargle with her former flame\u2019s mouthwash and then spit it all back into the bottle. Blech! But that\u2019s what he gets for not letting her drive that stupid old pickup truck. Item destroyed: Entire apartment Method of destruction: Tossing and strewing Level of decimation: 7 While she technically didn\u2019t do any of the destruction (since -- spoiler -- it was all a daydream in the end), it\u2019s satisfying to imagine Taylor flinging all his stuff on the ground. Item destroyed: A microphone Method of destruction: Fire Level of decimation: 6 Perhaps Swift\u2019s song is so hot that she lit the microphone afire? Or perhaps her rage is so fiery that the mic spontaneously combusted? Either way, those mics are expensive, so that sucks for the A/V guy. Item destroyed: A photo of the dumb boy and Taylor in better times Method of destruction: Flames, sweet flames Level of decimation: 2 Since the relationship ended, no need to keep that photo. Might as well light it up and toss it out the window. Item destroyed: A science experiment Method of destruction: Negligence Level of decimation: 2 Taylor is so distracted by Drew\u2019s smile and humor in science class that she lets her experiment blow up on accident! How embarrassing. Item destroyed: Study hall Method of destruction: A simultaneous flinging of homework Level of decimation: 3 Taylor pulls off some sort of Matilda magic as the energy of her frustration causes chaos in her school\u2019s library. In a tumultuous near-end relationship, her thoughts drive her crazy, and papers go flying. I hope the custodian got paid overtime. Item destroyed: All her haters Method of destruction: Success Level of decimation: 10 Swift really destroyed her bullies when she got \"big enough so you can\u2019t hit me\" -- surpassing their hatred, jealousy and pettiness -- and started living for herself. Item destroyed: Sheet cake Method of destruction: Devouring Level of decimation: 8 There\u2019s a lot of cake to be eaten when Taylor has a mega-hangout with her fellow 22-year-olds, and she makes a pretty good dent with the fork. Item destroyed: Heart-shaped pinata Method of destruction: Smashing Level of decimation: 5 There\u2019s two types of heartbreak: The bad kind involves a lot of crying. The good kind involves smashing a heart-shaped pinata and eating candy afterward. Item destroyed: A nice floral arrangement Method of destruction: An MLB-worthy pitch Level of decimation: 5 Swift throws a bouquet of flowers at her unsuspecting beau, missing him and hitting the fireplace. But that\u2019s only the beginning of the destruction when she decides to sabotage their relationship. Item destroyed: A smartphone Method of destruction: Dropping it in a fountain Level of decimation: 9 When she finds him texting, Swift gets weirdly suspicious of her partner. Since there\u2019s no precaution too cautious, she plunks his phone right in a pool of water. Item destroyed: The fireplace Method of destruction: Punching Level of decimation: 4 Who knew Taylor had a punch? When she bashes her fist into one of her mansion\u2019s many fireplaces, dust goes flying. But it\u2019s nothing a little plaster can\u2019t patch up. Item destroyed: A painted portrait Method of destruction: Fury, and a knife Level of decimation: 7.5 After she slices her beau\u2019s portrait, there\u2019s no turning back. That painting might\u2019ve taken a lot of work, but when you need to let out some anger, it\u2019s all about symbolism, and c\u2019mon, his face is right there. Item destroyed: A white shirt Method of destruction: Furious snipping of scissors Level of decimation: 6 Swift goes ham with the scissors on her boyfriend\u2019s shirt, cutting here and there until he finds that two holes have been cut out of the front, Regina George-style. Item destroyed: A decent suit jacket Method of destruction: A blaze Level of decimation: 6 A innocent suit jacket gets in the path of Swift\u2019s \"Blank Space\" destruction, so she lights a match to it. It never stood a chance. Item destroyed: A rare Shelby AC Cobra Method of destruction: The force of a golf club and a vengeful woman Level of decimation: 10 The vintage ride suffers irreparable damage when Swift attacks it with a golf club, her boyfriend looking on in agony. Item destroyed: A heart-shaped, jelly-filled cake Method of destruction: Butcher knife Level of decimation: 3 Blood-like jelly squirts from the cake\u2019s wound as Taylor punctures it with passionate violence. Item destroyed: A poor tree Method of destruction: An ax Level of decimation: 9 Mother Nature feels Swift\u2019s wrath during her rampage against her (maybe) disloyal partner. In the spot where she had once etched her guy\u2019s name, she pounds an ax into the tree\u2019s trunk. Item destroyed: An unsecured wall Method of destruction: Taylor Swift Level of decimation: 10 The \"Bad Blood\" badass busts through the drywall while training for her next face-off with Selena Gomez, punching it into chunks with one blow. Item destroyed: An entire city? Method of destruction: Fire and gas, probably Level of decimation: 100 On her way to tell Selena what\u2019s good, Taylor and her crew of famous celebrities-turned-combat artists blow up a city, leaving clouds of fire and ash behind them and never looking back.

It was everywhere and with her debut album release, Songs in A Minor, she became the best-selling new artist of 2001 and a GRAMMY Award winner. Keys' subsequent releases made her a living legend, and arguably, one of the most talented and powerful artists to ever live. She can sing anything, look good doing it and with two episodes of \"The Voice\" under her belt, she's also proving she might be the most sincere and humble GRAMMY winner to ever live. As Keys heard the first few bars of her \"If I Ain't Got You,\" being sung behind her, everything changed-- her face lit up, but not in the \"can you believe someone is singing my song right here, right now?\" No, it was more of a honor for her, she couldn't wait to hear what Lauren Diaz was going to do with her 2004 hit. Giphy In less than 30 seconds, Keys had heard all she needed to hear. She pressed that button and spent the next 2 minutes cheering on Diaz as she powered through the song. And this isn't just any song, Keys won a GRAMMY for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance for \"If I Ain't Got You.\" When the song was over, Keys marched up to the stage, hugged Diaz and said, \"wow.\" The audience had learned before the performance that Diaz grew up idolizing Keys, but the other coaches still put up a decent fight to get her to join their teams. After pitches from Miley Cyrus, a poem from Adam Levine, and a great talk from Blake Shelton, Keys was back. And what did she do? Keys sang the song back to her. After she said, \"can you just tell me a little bit about yourself?\" Yes, that's right, Keys, 15-time GRAMMY winner sang the song back to her. And with that 30-second performance, Keys changed \"The Voice.\" And, maybe, I teared up.", "July 24, 2016 | 5:26am President Obama's brother, Malik Obama, says he plans to vote for Donald Trump in November.

Malik Obama dedicated his 2012 biography of his late father to Khadafy and others who were \"making this world a better place.\" \"I still feel that getting rid of Khadafy didn\u2019t make things any better in Libya,\" he said. \"My brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard.\" But what bothers him even more is the Democratic Party\u2019s support of same-sex marriage. \u2018I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart. Make America Great Again is a great slogan. I would like to meet him.\u2019 - Malik Obama \"I feel like a Republican now because they don\u2019t stand for same-sex marriage, and that appeals to me,\" he said. Obama believes strongly in the institution of marriage \u2014 so strongly that he has at least three current wives, although press reports have put the number as high as 12. When asked by The Post how many wives and children he has, Obama demurred. \"That\u2019s personal,\" he said. Obama made headlines in 2011 when he married his third wife, who was still in her teens. Obama plans to trek back to the US to vote for Trump in November. Obama used to live in Maryland, where he worked for many years as an accountant and is registered to vote there, public records show. The president\u2019s and Malik\u2019s father, Barack Obama Sr., left Kenya in 1959 when Malik was a year old and his mother was pregnant with his sister Auma. Obama Sr. enrolled at the University of Hawaii, where he met and married the president\u2019s mother, Stanley Ann Dunham. Malik Obama didn\u2019t meet his younger half-brother until 1985. President Obama, 54, has seven half-siblings from both sides of his family. Malik Obama, the eldest, is the director of the Barack H. Obama Foundation, a controversial Virginia charity named for his father. He says he started the charity in 2008 because he wanted to make a difference in the family\u2019s hardscrabble village in Kenya. But the charity came under fire when The Post revealed in 2011 that it was an off-the-books operation that hadn\u2019t registered with the state of Virginia or, as it claimed, had tax-exempt status from the IRS. Shortly after The Post report, the IRS gave its stamp of approval, leading to speculation that the president had intervened. Malik Obama seen announcing his intention to run for a Kenyan gubernatorial seat.

According to its latest tax filing, the nonprofit has just $24,000 in its coffers. \"My brother didn\u2019t help me at all,\" said Obama. \"He wanted me to shut it down when I set it up. He hasn\u2019t supported me at all.\" Lately, family ties seem to be frayed. Obama, who was best man at the president\u2019s wedding, said he spoke to his brother a year ago and was miffed that he did nothing to help his own foray into politics when he ran for governor of the southwestern Kenyan county of Siaya in 2013. Malik Obama lost the race, and spent $20,000 of his own money on the unsuccessful campaign. \"I don\u2019t think politics is my thing,\" he told The Post. \"Honestly, I\u2019ll be happy when my brother is out of office, and I will finally be out of the limelight and be able to live like a human being.\" Until then, Obama wears his new GOP colors proudly; He even has a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. \"Mr. Trump is providing something new and something fresh,\" he said.", "Making special requests when booking a hotel isn't exactly uncommon.

Colbert ran a segment Wednesday night where he joked about Fox News' obsession with Hillary Clinton's age if she were to run in the upcoming presidential election. He called out Kurtz in particular for raising the question, \"How old is too old?\" Kurtz, the host of \"MediaBuzz,\" warned viewers Thursday that he would be hitting back at Colbert during his show Sunday morning, and he was true to his word. \"Listen, Colbert,\" Kurtz said sternly. \"I asked whether it was fair for commentators to harp on her [Hillary Clinton's] age. I guess that was too nuanced for your 'black and white' view of the world.\" Kurtz proceeded to list off a number of reasons why Colbert's segment was misleading, asking him why he didn't manage to fit all of the facts into his comedic narrative. \"Even fake anchors should have standards,\" Kurtz said. \"You, sir, were not even truthy.\" In a blog post for Fox News Insider Friday, Kurtz told readers that he would be addressing his anger on the show, writing that \"it's about time someone took on Stephen Colbert.\" \"This guy -- a fake anchor if ever there was one -- has been maligning hard-working journalists for too long,\" he wrote. \"In an effort to get a few cheap laughs, this Comedy Central clown took my work out of context and, worse, engaged in selective editing. It was nothing less than a deliberate attempt to mislead viewers.\" Kurtz continued his show with another analysis of whether or not Hillary Clinton's age should pose questions about her health and ability to run.

Nothing is more important to Floyd Mayweather Jr. than his image, so we really shouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear how much he spends on haircuts. Still, we can\u2019t help but shake our head at it. TMZ recently spoke with Jackie Starr, who is Mayweather\u2019s stylist and has been cutting his hair since 2009. It sounds like a pretty good gig for her, as Floyd pays $1,000 per haircut and hits her up multiple times a week. \"I cut his hair two times a week, three times is pushing it, but then it also depends on the occasion,\" Starr said. \"If he\u2019s in training I will cut him Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\" That means there are weeks when Starr makes $3,000 just for cutting Mayweather\u2019s hair. She could do nothing else and pull in six figures annually by giving Floyd haircuts. Not bad, right? As we know, Mayweather has lots and lots of money.

But the way the research is framed may change the way we view the results, said Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at Demos, a left-leaning think tank. \"There are important reasons to look at homeownership and what\u2019s happening among young households because it\u2019s still the greatest opportunity to generate wealth that young people have,\" he said. \"But what I find frustrating about the debate around student debt and homeownership is that it looks at only two binary variables: Whether you have student debt and whether you own a home. The debate assumes that if it\u2019s not having an impact on homeownership, it\u2019s not having an impact at all.\" It\u2019s hard to deny that the debt is having an impact, given the rising cost of a college degree combined with stagnating wages over the past several years, Huelsman said.

Still, he understands where the obsession with student debt on homeownership comes from. \"People tend to look at homeownership as a marker of economic health,\" he said.

Many people ask me, \"Is high fructose syrup really that bad for you?\" And my answer to this question is \"Yes,\" mainly for this very reason. In America today, we are eating huge doses of sugar, especially high fructose corn syrup. It is sweeter and cheaper than regular sugar and is in every processed food and sugar-sweetened drink. Purging it from your diet is the single best thing you can do for your health! In recent history, we've gone from 20 teaspoons of sugar per person per year to about 150 pounds of sugar per person per year. That's a half pound a day for every man, woman, and child in America. The average 20-ounce soda contains 15 teaspoons of sugar, all of it high fructose corn syrup. And when you eat sugar in those doses, it becomes a toxin. As part of the chemical process used to make high fructose corn syrup, the glucose and fructose -- which are naturally bound together -- become separated. This allows the fructose to mainline directly into your liver, which turns on a factory of fat production in your liver called lipogenesis. This leads to fatty liver, the most common disease in America today, affecting 90 million Americans. This, in turn, leads to diabesity -- pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. So, high fructose corn syrup is the real driver of the current epidemic of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, dementia, and of course, Type 2 diabetes. HFCS contains dangerous chemicals and contaminants Beside the ginormous load of pure fructose and sugar found in HCFS, as an added bonus, it contains other chemical toxins. Chemical contaminants used during manufacturing end up in the HFCS and in our food. What we know, for example, is that chloralkali is used in making high fructose corn syrup. Chloralkai contains mercury. And there are trace amounts of mercury found in high fructose corn syrup-containing beverages. Now, it may not be a problem if we eat this occasionally, but the average person in the country consumes more than 20 teaspoons a day of high fructose corn syrup and the average teenager has 34 teaspoons a day. Over time, these heavy metals can accumulate in the body, causing health problems. Additionally, when we look at the chemical components of high fructose corn syrup on a spectrograph, we can see that it contains many weird chemicals that we know nothing about. That's why I say better safe than sorry. Look out for the red flag The main reason you should give up high fructose corn syrup is that it's a big red flag for very poor quality food. If you see this ingredient on a label, I guarantee you the food is processed junk. So, if high fructose corn syrup is anywhere on the label, put it back on the shelf. You should never eat this food. If you want to stay healthy, lose weight easily, get rid of chronic disease, and help reduce the obesity epidemic, the single most important thing you can do is eliminate high fructose corn syrup from your diet and from your children's diet. Just banish it from your house. Purge your kitchen I challenge you to go into your kitchen right now, go in the cupboard and refrigerator, and look at every single label. And I want you to count how many products you have right now in your house that contain high fructose corn syrup. Then, I want you to get a big garbage bag and throw them out and find replacements that are free of it. If you want to have some sugar, that's fine. Have a little sugar, but add it to your food yourself. Don't eat food made with added sugar. Cut the high fructose corn syrup from your life forever. You'll be healthier. Our planet will be healthier. And we'll have a healthier generation of children.

If you're looking for a review, you won't find it here, other than to say -- if you live in this city and if you can, try to get tickets. The piece deals with the intersection of art and commerce, of emotion and human psychology, and it is funny and moving in a way that I can't quite articulate just yet. Here's what I actually want to talk about. I went home and began to leaf through the playbill, a slim, stapled offering handed to me upon my exit. The quote that stopped me dead in my tracks was tucked into a tiny back corner of the program, buried under the lists of donors and sponsors and advertising. Printed at the very bottom of the page, here's what I read: I don't know if this blew your mind, but mine exploded across the kitchen. Bear with me on this, because I really need to reason this out. Let's say I'm in the grocery store, and I'm in the mood for jam. OK. I can deal with this. Cherry. Blueberry. Lemon. Raspberry. Mint. Orange. I can narrow this down pretty quickly. Mint jam is weird. Lemon is too tart. Blueberry and Raspberry are too seedy. Orange is always artificial-tasting. Cherry it is. Let's say I go to a bigger grocery store. Crap. I think I... I mean, I used to like cherry, but... there are so many other kinds out here. I didn't even know they made pomegranate-plum. What's a persimmon again? OK. With me so far? This makes sense. It shouldn't, but it does. Too many choices make me feel anxious. What if I choose incorrectly? Maybe I just don't want jam after all. Forget it. I'll just go home without it, or buy something else instead. After all, the perfect jam has to be out there somewhere. Why waste my time and money on all these other ones? Now. Let's say I'm a single lady in a small town. Say, not in the present day. Let's say, just for the sake of argument, I'm a single lady in a small town in some year before the invention of the automobile or the telephone. In order to leave my small town, I would have to travel by horseback. In order to hear news from other places in the world, I would either have to receive a letter, hear someone tell me a story, or go out and find the information myself. Let's say I'm a single lady in a small town and the ol' hormones kicked in and I'm really interested in having sex and, I guess, by association, getting married and making babies. Now, let's go visit that small, hometown grocery store. OK. OK. I can deal with this. Not the one with the crazy eyes. Not the one who smells bad. Probably the one who has a kind smile and seems to think I'm funny. Yeah. OK. Him it is. (For the sake of not being viewed as a total moron, I should state that this is an incredibly simplified way of viewing world history. If you were a woman living in the days before the automobile and the telephone, and you were fortunate enough not to have been born, say, a slave, or a street urchin, or in a time where your father or male relatives could sell you like property, you still simply didn't have a lot of options, and that sucks. Even if you did wind up lucking out with a really delicious kind of jam, like, say, pear, you still kinda had to hope that after years and years and years of eating pear jam for every meal, that you still liked the flavor as much as when you first opened the jar. You kinda just had to hope that pear jam wasn't the kind of saccharine-based life form who would beat you or deny you the right to vote or otherwise generally be an asshole.) OK. Let's say it's somewhat later in our collective history. Let's say we're a single gal in a somewhat larger town. Crap. There's just a lot of choices out there. What if I choose wrong? What if this isn't the one I'm supposed to be with? What if there's someone else out there who is the right flavor, and I made a hasty decision too soon because I thought I was supposed to be done with the grocery shopping by a certain time and place in my life? Ok. Now, let's say it's the year 2013. Let's say you live in a large metropolitan area. Let's say that the last year's census for the city of Philadelphia clocked in at 1,547,607 people. Some of these people are old, some are children, some are married. Approximately 43% of Americans are unmarried and over the age of 18. So, while we're doing some guesstimating here, because I can't find specific information on the number of unmarried folks in Philadelphia per se, let's say that there are approximately 665,471 unmarried people in this city. On average, there are slightly more women than men in this city, but let's make it easy on ourselves and divide that number in half. So, let's just say that there are 332,735.5 unmarried men in this city. (Let's round up to 332,736, because I hate to imagine that poor half-man out there alone in the city on this rainy night). Now, let's look at those 332,736 men. Some of them are probably old. Some of them are probably gay. Some of them probably wear Ed Hardy baseball caps. I can disregard those flavors of jam pretty easily. Still. Just looking at this picture gives me the nervous poops. And this is why online dating made me totally miserable. There were simply too many choices. I was so overwhelmed by the number of options, and yet so oddly disappointed that none of them appeared to say \"Hey! I'm your future husband!\" right there on the page. When there are that many options, it's all the more frustrating that the obvious choice is harder to find. I would scroll through a seemingly endless supply of men who purportedly lived in my very own city but whom I had never seen before, until the only option was to just eliminate people for purely superficial reasons. Works in a bank? Boring. Has a cat? Eh. Has a beard? I guess I like beards. Went to Burning Man? Oh, dear, probably not. All the while, I was equally aware of how many of those same men had to be flipping through a seemingly endless supply of single women, staring at my profile and thinking, \"Likes to read. They all say that. Mel Brooks movies? Whatever. Nice eyes, but a little pudgy around the middle.\" I went on one real date. He was nice enough, but I didn't feel the connection, and plus that online superficiality had utterly bled into the real-life encounter. I realized about five minutes into it that he was a totally nice and decent and well-educated person that I had written off upon first glance because he arrived at the bar wearing a pink paisley shirt and purple skinny jeans. I spent the rest of the evening unable to focus on a word he said, because my own inner monologue kept repeating over and over and over, Stop being such a superficial asshole. The night I deleted my account for good, I had gone out dancing with some friends at this big dance party on a boat. It turned into one of those epic evenings where tons of people I know turned up, all of whom work in my industry, all dancing together, just sweating it out on this hot summer night to Michael Jackson and Prince and Beyonce\u0301. And I was having fun, until the very end of the night, where -- cue the world's smallest violin -- everybody else seemed to pair off and disappear together and I was left on South Street, hailing a cab alone. F*ck this, I thought, the Internet is full of all of these other choices! There are literally thousands and thousands of men out there, in the vast array of the universe, in this expansive and vibrant city. I am a smart, capable, attractive, single lady. There's no shame in this. I'm so sick of always going out and seeing the same people, only ever meeting people who work in the same field. I just want to meet someone completely different, someone who is nothing like the people I work with all day and socialize with all night. I turned on the computer and logged into OkCupid. There's this screen when you log in that shows you your \"Three Top-Rated New Matches!\" I sh*t you not, this is what popped up on the homepage: I knew all three. I had kissed ALL three. All three worked in my field. All three were my top-rated matches. All three had been at the boat dance party that night. I deleted the account, put on my pajamas, and ate a bag of popcorn while watching \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\" until the sun came up. Somewhere out there, I gotta believe there's a jam jar waiting around for me. I really have to think so. Why else would we have so many stories and fairytales and folklore and mystique about picking the right one off the shelf? At the same time: I'm easily overwhelmed. Thinking about the reality without using metaphor is more complicated, more lonely, more sad. I sometimes catch myself feeling a little jealous of my friends who married young, who stayed in their small-town grocery stores. They seem to have figured something out in a way that I can't, or won't. I read those statistics, the ones in those articles that always have headlines like COLLEGE-EDUCATED WOMEN MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN FREAK SHARKNADO FIRE THAN MARRY AFTER AGE 35, and they wear on my soul in a way that I'm not totally comfortable admitting. The worst part of all of this is, I mostly love my life as a single lady. I really don't have too many complaints. Unlike our theoretical single-gal example from earlier, the one with six options and a horse, I am afforded the benefits of freedom of speech and religion and the right to vote and wear pants and take birth control and get a job and serve in the military. I realize that this complaint might seem incredibly petty. Woe is me! I have too many choices! There are simply too many things to do in this vast and incredible world! I have a job that I love! I surround myself with other single friends who are creative, fun and supportive people! I have dated some extremely smart, talented men, and I'm so glad I didn't have to marry them, because they were totally wrong for me! I get to have the bed to myself every night and no one will care if I eat grilled cheese in it! Poor, poor, single, lonely me, unabashedly living a terrific life! And yet, sometimes, you sit back, and the bed seems kinda empty, and you really just want some f*cking jam. I don't really have a good answer for that. Except, I guess, to take a deep breath. To remember that grocery shopping is not a race. To stop looking at what everyone else has in their shopping cart. And to remember that even though it sucks and it scares me, I have to keep walking back into that store.", "If you thought Marc Jacobs had already made Louis Vuitton's Paris Fashion Week show a hot ticket, next Wednesday's runway is sure to be the hottest yet: It may just be Jacobs' last for the brand. The rumor mill is buzzing about an imminent departure, as Jacobs' contract with Louis Vuitton ends next month. \"His contract may not be renewed,\" a source told Reuters. Though the popular designer has seen the storied fashion house through successful times since joining in 1997, he is reportedly internally approved within the company to leave. This isn't the first we've heard of Jacobs and Louis Vuitton going separate ways, though. Back in June, Women's Wear Daily sparked chatter after reporting that Jacobs was being sought after to replace Reed Krakoff as creative director at Coach. Plus, Louis Vuitton is already at work revamping its design team, tapping Proenza Schouler's accessories designer, Darren Spaziani (the man behind the brand's wildly popular PS1 handbag), to spruce up its logo-centric offerings. As for Jacobs' replacement, Nicolas Ghesquie\u0300re's name has been the front-runner ever since the first round of rumors. The French designer, an industry darling, was unceremoniously ousted from his creative director position at Balenciaga and replaced by Alexander Wang last year. A source confirmed to Fashionista in June that Ghesquie\u0300re and LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate which owns Louis Vuitton, were \"in serious negotiations\" about a top position with Louis Vuitton. But until we get official confirmation, we're remaining skeptical. Regarding Jacobs' departure, another industry source told Reuters, \"Nothing has been decided yet.\" So as of now, the only thing that's certain is that nothing's certain. Let's hope Jacobs drops some hints at his Fashion Week show next week. We've reached out to Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton for comment, so stay tuned for updates.", "Here\u2019s how much you should be tipping your hairdresserMore Remembering how much you\u2019re supposed to tip anywhere can be hard \u2014 what do current trends dictate? Is there such a thing as too much? And what if you got a discount on the service? But knowing how much to tip your hairdresser has to be one of the more confusing tip scenarios out there, especially if you get your hair done at a salon where more than one person works on your strands. Below, once and for all, is a definitive guide to tipping your hairstylist \u2014 and their assistant, shampooist, and everyone in between. Thank us later \u2014 no tip necessary. If you need a simple baseline, experts agree that tipping 20% is standard and acceptable at any hair salon. If you\u2019re in a smaller town, 15% may be the norm. You can always ask the receptionist at your salon what\u2019s typical, or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment. Offering the person who shampoos your hair $3 to $5 is a nice gesture. You can hand the money directly to the shampooist, or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pass it along. As for your stylist\u2019s assistant, that person is likely in training and may not be making much money, so Michelle Lee, master designer and manager at Salon Eva Michelle in Boston, recommends tipping them between $5 and $20. \"All the assistants are there in training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you,\" she told InStyle. Try to bring cash to tip, if possible. Not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane. And yes, it\u2019s OK to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon. Also, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture. Your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon. If you\u2019re a woman with shorter hair \u2014 meaning you get it cut and/or colored regularly \u2014 your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip. After all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client\u2019s. As for tipping on a discounted service: Stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon. When in doubt, ask at the front desk! Finally, if you\u2019re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip. If they invite you back for a fix-up cut, though, etiquette expert Peggy Post suggests offering a tip of 15-20%.", "Anyone who has a small bladder knows to think twice before downing a Big Gulp during a road trip. Traffic jams, questionably hygienic rest stop bathrooms or, worse, miles of open road with no civilization in sight are all high-risk situations. So instead, you find yourself dehydrated, which also sucks. Good news, there is a solution. Good news: Recent studies have shown that knocking back a cold glass of milk could be the answer to all of your pee-related struggles. Why? It\u2019s chock-full of nutrients and electrolytes like potassium, which not only keep you hydrated but also take longer for your body to process so you buy some time between bathroom breaks. Just sip on one percent or skim if you\u2019re worried about the cals.", "Two months ago on Tuesday, Britain voted to leave the European Union . The shock was immense; the fallout dramatic. But then summer came. The early turbulence subsided and normality (more or less) returned. Brexit, though, has not yet begun to happen. The government does not know what it wants and is not yet equipped to ask for it. Britain and the EU, it is increasingly clear, are far more intimately enmeshed than the leave camp had claimed. For all the leavers\u2019 assurances, extricating the UK from the bloc, negotiating new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world \u2013 and ensuring that Britain\u2019s laws and practices adapt \u2013 is a gargantuan undertaking. The referendum result, however, is a political reality. The 52% of leave voters \u2013 and the politicians who represented them \u2013 expect it to be acted upon. So two months on, where does Brexit stand? The three Brexiteers \u2013 (from left) Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox The machinery \u2013 and the cost One of the first acts of the new prime minister, Theresa May, was to establish two new ministries : the Department for Exiting the European Union, led by David Davis, and the Department for International Trade, headed by Liam Fox. Neither is yet fully up and running. Worse, a predictable and potentially damaging turf war already appears to be under way between Fox\u2019s ministry and the last of the cabinet\u2019s three Brexiters, Boris Johnson at the Foreign Office. That aside, International Trade has so far secured about 10% of the trade negotiators it needs. (Britain has few skilled personnel because the EU negotiates trade deals for its members. Canada, in contrast, has 300.) Meanwhile, DExEU, as it is known, has hired \u2013 mainly from elsewhere in the civil service \u2013 150 of the 250-300 total staff it is expected to employ, and reportedly has yet to move into its permanent home. With the civil service a fifth smaller since 2010, fast-stream recruits are being drafted in, but negotiators, lawyers, economists, regulatory experts and management consultants from the private sector will prove essential. They will not come cheap: experienced senior personnel from the likes of KPMG, PwC, Linklater\u2019s and McKinsey cost up to \u00a35,000 a day, recruitment consultants say , or will be seconded on annual salaries of up to \u00a3250,000. Trade talks are rarely quick and don\u2019t come cheap \u2013 some estimates put the bill at \u00a35bn and the timetable at 10 years. Some estimates suggest \"full Brexit\" may take 10 years and involve up to 10,000 people, not only in the new and other so-called \"hot\" departments such as foreign, home, environment and business, but across the civil service nationally, at an administrative cost of close to \u00a35bn. Hannah White, Brexit lead at the Institute for Government, claims such figures are \"finger in the wind\" stuff but warns that with all the government has set out to achieve besides Brexit \"there is clearly going to have to be a really, really strong process of prioritisation\". The model \u2013 and why it matters The government has not yet decided what trade relationship it wants with the EU. A huge amount hangs on the choice between \"membership of\" and \"access to\" the EU\u2019s single market. One alternative is a free trade agreement with the EU, such as Canada\u2019s recent deal; but this gives Britain only limited access to the single market. Although that may be politically acceptable, it would take longer to agree and could hit the economy harder \u2013 especially the all-important services sector; trade deals are invariably much tougher on services than on goods. Recent signs indicate the government may be mulling a deal outside the single market as the only option acceptable to voters. May has spoken of a \"bespoke\" agreement, and ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reckons Whitehall is aiming for a deal based on Canada\u2019s, albeit with \"a bespoke add-on for services\". Before any decision can be made, DExEU has to work out exactly which bits of single market membership \u2013 including non-tariff barriers, the common regulations, licences and standards that, for example, give UK banks their \"passport\" to operate across the EU \u2013 are most valuable, and what they are worth. The politics \u2013 and the timing May\u2019s catchphrase that \"Brexit means Brexit\" may disguise Whitehall\u2019s uncertainty about what Brexit actually means, but it does commit to deliver it \u2013 and there are plenty pushing to ensure it does. That constitutes a \"hard\" Brexit: crashing out of the EU and the single market with no economic safety net beyond WTO rules, which would mean costly tariffs. The \"soft\" approach \u2013 taking time to negotiate an exit and a preferential trade arrangement \u2013 is plainly the government\u2019s favoured course. Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. But there is a persistent rumour that late 2017 or even early 2018 is more likely, partly because it could take Whitehall at least that long to be ready before triggering the two-year exit talks, and partly because Dutch, French and German elections will get in the way. That would mean Britain would not leave the EU until late 2019, which the pro-Brexit camp as well as the EU, which wants Brexit over before the 2019 European elections and the new EU budget in 2020, have said emphaticallyis not desirable. Some observers argue that since the Tory leadership has never been capable of resisting its Eurosceptic wing (of which Davis and Fox \u2013 the day-to-day Brexit ministers \u2013 are hardcore members), the talks may prove short-lived: a \"hard\" Brexit could happen. Those other negotiations ... Assuming Brexit remains soft, article 50 is just the beginning, covering the essential details of the divorce: who pays the pensions of Britain\u2019s EU staff, where the EU institutions based in Britain end up. As well as the article 50 talks a raft of others must follow, including on Britain\u2019s new trade deal with the EU, which could prove so complicated it requires an interim agreement to tide things over. Then Britain\u2019s full WTO membership must be re-established (which means drawing up a new set of national tariffs, a monumental task, and winning approval from 164 countries), and the 50-plus free trade agreements negotiated by the EU on its members\u2019 behalf renegotiated. It is not clear legally whether the UK can leave the EU, constitutionally speaking, without a vote in parliament. A high court case starts in October Plus, as Charles Grant, of the Centre for European Reform, points out , new deals will be needed on European security, defence, the environment, science and research and, in all probability, Northern Ireland. And that takes no account of the changes needed in UK domestic laws and regulations. Brexit, notes Dominic Cook of Oxford University\u2019s Sai\u0308d Business School, is \"the biggest transformational project a UK government has ever undertaken\" not only because of foreign negotiations but \"the inward-facing part: implementing and educating in the UK\". The legal challenges The most immediate obstacle to Brexit is judicial. There is a substantial school of thought which says the government is not constitutionally entitled to pull the trigger on article 50 without the specific approval of parliament. At least seven private actions have been grouped together and will be heard by the high court starting in October in what judges have said is a \"matter of great constitutional importance\", with a decision possible by the end of the year. Separately, cases have been launched in Northern Ireland arguing that Brexit would breach the Good Friday agreement by reinstating a physical border with the Republic of Ireland and undermining the legal basis for the 1998 peace deal. So, while we may be two months in, you might want to get used to the waiting. Brexit may not happen quite yet.", "Tried and tested by us. We spent a lot of 2016 trying out beauty products. Some of them were really good, some not so much. So here is a list of the beauty products that we swear by. 1. L.A.B.2 Lash Out Loud Mascara Wands , \u00a35.50 The L.A.B.\u22832; Lash Out Loud Mascara Wands is a collection of 12 disposable wands with four different brush styles. Each brush is designed to either volumise, lengthen, define, or curl the lashes. Emma says: \"These were great! I could definitely see a difference between the eye with just my normal mascara wand and the eye I used the separate wands for. I like that you can choose which effect you want, and the defining brush is super useful for fixing clumping.\" 2. Topshop Glow Stick, \u00a39 The Glow Stick is a twist-up highlighter stick that\u2019s meant to sculpt, define, and enhance the skin. Emma says: \"I loved this product. It was easy to blend, and it was shimmery without being too shimmery.\" 3. NYX Concealer Jar, \u00a35.50 This is a full-coverage concealer that\u2019s meant to hide dark circles and blemishes. Tolani says: \"Yeah, this shit is magical, no doubt about it. This is one of the best concealers I have ever used. I am so upset that I have been spending \u00a317.50 on the Benefit Boi-ing concealer when this \u00a35.50 gem exists. I am wearing the nutmeg shade and it is the perfect shade for me. It conceals very well, it doesn\u2019t feel heavy, and it\u2019s just so good. A little tip: It seems to apply better when dabbed on with a fingertip rather than a sponge.\" 4. Real Techniques Setting Brush, \u00a36.99 This setting brush is great for setting highlight powders and creams \u2013 it allows you to gain some control when dusting powder on your face. Tolani says: \"I like this brush. It\u2019s super soft and sets powder highlight beautifully and naturally \u2013 it literally just buffs it in. I love the shape and size of the brush. It\u2019s small enough to set my under-eye makeup, and it can also be used for contouring. It\u2019s really soft on my skin, and it doesn\u2019t waste any product. The only downside is that it took a little while to really blend the product into my skin, but apart from that, I love this.\" 5. NYX Wicked Lippies, \u00a35.50 NYX Wicked Lippies is a range of jewel-toned metallic shades. If you\u2019re into bright-coloured lipsticks, this is definitely for you. Emma says: \"This formula is great! It slipped on really well and the colour payoff was good. I liked it a lot. Also, the more I wore the blue lipstick, the more I liked it. I don\u2019t think I can pull off super bright/unusual lipstick colours, but this made me feel like maybe I could!\" Tolani says: \"NYX lipsticks are always really good, and this range is just as good as all the others. The formula is EVERYTHING. I just don\u2019t think I can get away with this colour.\" Tolani is wearing the Risque shade and Emma is wearing the Envy shade. 6. Kiko Finish Line Lipstick, \u00a33.90 It\u2019s a \u00a33.90 lipstick that looks amazing on. Both Tolani and Emma are really into the colour and the moisturising formula. It glides along your lips smoothly and stays on all day. The formula is creamy and although the finish is matte, your lips feel very much moisturised. The colour payoff wasn\u2019t amaaaazing \u2013 we needed about three coats to really see the colour \u2013 but for this price it was great. 7. Golden Monkey Glamour Lip Kit, \u00a38.50 The contents of this really cute packaging are meant to transform chapped lips and make them really soft and supple. You have to follow three steps, and it will take around 30 to 40 minutes, so it\u2019s worth finding something to entertain yourself with. The first step is a pad that\u2019s meant to lightly exfoliate dead skin while nourishing your lips. The second step is a mask that soothes your lips. It includes shea butter and jojoba seed oil, which are both really key ingredients when it comes to soothing.The final step is a luxe lip oil that feels like a really fancy lip balm. Emma says: \"They were great. Looking ridiculous was really worth it. My lips felt very moisturised and plumped-up.\" 8. Sleek Colour Corrector Palette, \u00a37.99 This colour-correcting palette comes in six different colours that are meant to work on different skin tones and \"problem\" areas. Green: Helps with redness and is meant to be ideal for concealing scars and blemishes. Lilac: Meant for brightening sallow, dull complexions. Blue: Neutralises orange, which is apparently good for concealing freckles. Rose: Adds radiance and evens out dark sports. Yellow: Helps to conceal under-eye circles on light skin tones. Orange: Conceals dark circles on dark skin tones. Tolani says: \"While all the colours in the palette were not for me, I think that it\u2019s great that the one palette sees to most skin tones. I used the rose and orange colours and I think it really works. I\u2019m also really into how easy it was to cover up. I would definitely use it again.\" 9. NYX Curve Liner, \u00a312 What\u2019s really cool about this eyeliner is the shape. The curve is meant to make holding the liner easier so you can apply it better. Tolani says: \"Gosh, this might be the best eyeliner I have ever used. It\u2019s so bloody good. The shape of the eyeliner really makes a difference. It\u2019s really easy to hold and the formula glides on so well. So yes, \u00a312 is a little steep for eyeliner, but it is really worth the money.\" 10. H&M Nail Polish, \u00a33.99 Tolani says: \"This nail polish is as good as, if not better than, any name-brand nail polish I have tried. The colours are amazing, the brush is perfectly thick, and it\u2019s really easy to apply. The polish lasted four days before it started to chip, and that was without topcoat.\" 11. Kiko Eye Base Primer, \u00a37.90 The primer promises to keep eyeshadow in place for longer, make application easier, and brighten up eyeshadow. It has a shimmery base to it, and comes out very pearlescent when applied. We both loved this product so much. The primer actually makes the eyeshadow look better and stay longer. 12. Rimmel Professional Eyebrow Pencil, \u00a32.99 Tolani says: \"This pen worked wonders on my brows, and it\u2019s just as good as any other brow kits I have tried. I really like it. I am sold and will definitely be using this from now on \u2013 it does the exact same job as my MAC Eyebrow Pencil, which costs \u00a314.\" 13. Collection Fast Stroke Eyeliner, \u00a32.99 This eyeliner gets top marks and it\u2019s only \u00a32.99. It\u2019s super easy to use and the precision you get with it is just amazing. 14. Fleur De Force By Eylure \u2013 Fleur Loves Lashes, \u00a35.25 Tolani says: \"These lashes are more of a corner lash than a full-strip lash, and I\u2019m really into them. These were really easy to apply and just kinda fell into place, with the help of tweezers of course. They are subtle enough to wear all day, and I really like the feline flick they give.\" 15. Sleek MakeUp True Colour Lipstick, \u00a34.99 YES to colour, YES to pigment, yes to everything about this lipstick. Not only does it literally slide along your lips, the colours are vibrant AF and it stayed on the whole day, even after lunch. The range comes in 21 different shades and you can get both matte and sheer textures.", "For 20 years, Bruce Lubin and his wife Jeanne have been collecting tips and hints to save time, money, and make everyday tasks easier.

And if you\u2019re not caught up on the ride (aka the season) be aware that this article will have some Season 6 spoilers. Here\u2019s Melisandre with a Bravos-style greeting as you happily go about your day. HBO/Giphy At this point in the series, fans of both the show and the books know there\u2019s one major character who hasn\u2019t yet been introduced at all. Well, to be fair, there are lots of major characters who haven\u2019t (and won\u2019t) be introduced, this one is different. Her name is Lady Stoneheart and we already have met her. Sort of. Lady Stoneheart is the resurrected corpse of everybody\u2019s favorite Tully turned loving Stark, Catelyn. In the books, the brotherhood without banners takes the Lady\u2019s corpse (Thank you, Red Wedding) and brings it back to life (and we know from Arya\u2019s time with them that they totally have the capability to do it). Many fans of the books were surprised that the character hasn\u2019t yet shown up in the series since she has a major hand in the fates of other characters. There was some speculation that the show may just skip over the character altogether and find other ways of getting to the same fates. People also thought that maybe the showrunners didn\u2019t want to show a major character\u2019s resurrection because it would take away from the (year-long) speculation about Jon Snow\u2019s death. But now that Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are both headed to Riverrun (where Lady Stoneheart, aka Catelyn Stark, happens to be from) to deal with her brother the Blackfish, all the dominos are finally in place for the character\u2019s big reveal. And, from what we know of Lady Stoneheart, she will definitely make an entrance (you know, if the show decides to bring her in). HBO/Giphy This season has already been filled with tons of stories of resurrection, both literal and metaphorical. From Jon Snow\u2019s most obvious return to the resurrection of Arya Stark (with her reclaiming Needle and seemingly giving up her quest to give up her identity and serve the Faceless God) to Daenerys\u2019 return to her rightful place as Khaleesi, it would definitely fit with the season\u2019s overall theme. And it\u2019s likely no coincidence that another Stark we thought was dead just happened to pop up, resurrected and transformed, in the last episode. Hopefully we can see this badass character make a memorable appearance. And, while they\u2019re at it, maybe we can bring back Robb Stark just, you know, because?

As the ultimate case in point, EpiPen costs have increased to about $600 for a pack of two \u2013 a substantial price hike from the $100 when Mylan acquired it in 2007. But does a decent, cheaper alternative exist? Yes, according to Consumer Reports. Here\u2019s how to try and get one. 1. Avoid asking for Teva's generic version of the EpiPen. It did not get approval from the Food and Drug Administration due to \"certain major deficiencies.\" 2. Do ask your doctor to write a prescription for \"generic Adrenaclick.\" While it is not the same delivery system, they do both contain epinephrine in equal dosages. You have to ask for this specifically. If your prescription says EpiPen, you can only be given an EpiPen. Unlike with other medications, your pharmacist cannot simply switch the cheaper generic. 3. Next, get a coupon from GoodRx to substaintially lower the $400 (without insurance) price tag. This could reduce costs to around $142. For those with insurance, the manufacturer offers a co-pay coupon to lower the price. 4. If the price is still much higher than that, ask your pharmacy about discounts. 5. Consult your pharmacist and read the instructions carefully \u2013 the device does not work in the same way as the EpiPen. Consider scheduling a training session, particularly for youth.", "When we heard the news that Rogue was releasing Sriracha Hot Stout Beer, we were intrigued. We promptly ordered a six-pack to find out how this bizarre flavor combination would taste. Being a fan of both Huy Fong's staple hot sauce\u2014and well, all beer\u2014I was eager to crack one. My initial thoughts? The bottle features an absolutely perfect version of the iconic sriracha rooster label, updated with Rogue's language. Get a bottle for your hot-sauce-loving friends, and they'll decorate their cubicles or man caves with it. Taste-wise, it's definitely drinkable. It's a rich stout with a tiny kick that hits you after the aftertaste. Would I order one in a bar? Um, if I saw \"Sriracha Beer\" on a menu anywhere, I'd order one in a heartbeat. Would I order a second one? Probably not. A session beer it is not. But it's a reasonable guess that Rogue doesn't think so either, given that the drink is only sold in single 750 ml bottles. But don't just take my word for it\u2014we invited some members of the Adweek team to taste test this spicy beer in the video above.", "Jared Leto may want to keep a safe distance from his Suicide Squad co-stars. It was previously believed that Viola Davis, who plays Amanda Waller in the supervillains superhero flick, didn't receive any of Leto's infamous gifts he sent to the cast during filming. Turns out she did receive a box of bullets. \"It was a little worrisome,\" Davis said. \"It made you a little bit nervous and I'm pretty tough. You know I got into a few fights when I was growing up...but it scared me a little bit.\" As you probably have heard by now, Leto got so into playing The Joker that his gift giving also included a live rat, a dead hog, used condoms, anal beads and porn magazines. Davis finally came face-to-face with the Oscar winner out of character after Suicide Squad wrapped at a Glamour magazine event. \"Before that I was only introduced to The Joker...and I almost had my pepper spray out. You know, 'You remember that bullet you sent me?'\" Davis said. But the wackiness wasn't reserved solely for Leto. \"Every single person in it gets to be completely insane because all the characters are insane,\" Davis said. \"They're bad guys. We're all bad guys.\" The David Ayer-directed movie's cast also includes Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Cara Delevingne, Common, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbake, Jai Courtney and Joel Kinnaman. She admitted, \"It got so crazy that there were times during filming that I had heart palpitations--not only heart palpitations but at one point I said, 'Did I suffer from hearing loss?'\" Leto explained his method acting when I chatted with him at CinemaCon earlier this year. \"I did a lot of things to create a dynamic to create an element of surprise, a spontaneity and to really break down any kind of walls that may be there,\" he said. \"The Joker is somebody who doesn't really respect things like personal space or boundaries.\" We could only imagine what the gift bag at the movie's premiere will be filled with.", "To many folks, Orlando is synonymous with the name \"Disney.\" Of course, there are other theme parks there (such as Universal Studios), but none is more famous than Disney World. Click here for 12 new Disney World attractions opening in 2016. Walt Disney first built the park in 1971 as a supplement to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which the animation legend had opened 16 years earlier, on July 17, 1955. However, Orlando wasn\u2019t the initial location that Walt considered for his second park. Plans had actually been drawn up in 1963 for an indoor theme park that was to be built in downtown St. Louis. Click here for the best restaurants at Disneyland Park. At the time, it made a lot of sense. Research showed that only five percent of Disneyland\u2019s guests traveled from east of the Mississippi River, despite the fact that 75 percent of America\u2019s population lived on that side of the country \u2014 and Walt desperately wanted the extra business. When the plans were drawn up, St. Louis was booming, the landmark Gateway Arch in St. Louis was under construction (it debuted in 1965), and Busch Stadium (est. 1966) was being built just a few blocks away. However, the would-be Missouri Disney World hit a few roadblocks. Anheuser-Busch beer baron August A. Busch Jr. (who ran much of the city) allegedly insisted that the theme park sell beer, which Walt refused to do in the name of a family-friendly environment. Additionally, Disney was only willing to pay for the rides and attractions, hoping St. Louis\u2019 redevelopment corporation would pay for the building that was to house them. The corporation balked at the idea, and Disney officially scrapped his plans in 1965. Disney World is opening a bar in the Tower of Terror. Click here for details. According to 13 pages of blueprints that went to auction late last year, the plans for the St. Louis park included rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad \u2014 all of which are now fixtures at the Florida park.

Chicago's infamous metal-themed burger joint, Kuma's Corner, recently rolled out their monthly special, this time named 'The Ghost Burger' after swedish metal band Ghost. The response has been... varied. Regardless of what you think, there's no doubting that the power of Christ compels you to try this sacrilegious burger. The bovine abomination comes equipped with a red wine reduction and an unconsecrated communion wafer to top the staggering 10oz patty, making it arguably the most brutal burger on the menu. Unsurprisingly, since the release of the Ghost burger Kuma's has caught flack from religious groups and been overwhelmed by interview requests about the blasphemously metal special. Kuma's responded by making a $1,500 donation to the local Catholic charities, which was promptly denied. If you're interested in taking a bite out of Kuma's blasphemous burger, make sure to visit their Belmont Ave location, or swing by the brand new restaurant, Kuma's Too located at 666 W. Diversey (no I'm not kidding). Remember to show up well in advance, or you'll be SOL, as Kuma's is notoriously busy and way too f*#&ing metal to give a crap about your hour long lunch break.", "Deadpool and HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley star T.

But it is the death of the woman he viciously attacked, Kitty Genovese, that will be forever memorialized as the reason our modern 911 system exists. The rape and murder of Genovese in 1964 -- one of the most resilient tall tales in American crime history -- also led to the adoption of Good Samaritan laws in the United States. These laws protect bystanders who step in to help someone they believe is injured or in danger. Moseley, a psychopathic serial killer whose March 28 death was confirmed on Monday, didn't know Genovese when he stalked her out of a New York City bar where she worked on the night of March 13. He then repeatedly stabbed and raped her outside of her apartment complex. It took an hour for cops to respond as Genovese bled out, and she died on the way to the hospital. The attack garnered instant and widespread outrage, as officers on the scene erroneously stated that dozens of neighbors witnessed separate attacks on Genovese, yet did nothing to help her. New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images A photo of Catherine 'Kitty' Genovese, 28. Two weeks later, The New York Times published a flawed but powerful front-page headline, \"37 Who Saw Murder Didn't Call the Police,\" and the tall tale was set in stone. For more than half an hour 38 respectable, law\u2010abiding citizens in Queens watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in three separate attacks in Kew Gardens. Twice the sound of their voices and the sudden glow of their bedroom Iights interrupted him and frightened him off. Each time he returned, sought her out and stabbed her again. Not one person telephoned \u2010 the police during the assault; one witness called after the woman was dead. As it turns out, nobody witnessed the attack, and the number of people who may have heard screams remains in dispute. The Times wrote on Monday that its original story was erroneous and exaggerated. New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images Winston Moseley in police custody after surrendering to an FBI agent in a Buffalo suburb, ending 74 hours of freedom. But the crime, and lack of response, stirred up a fear in Americans that led to real policy change. Psychology textbooks began connecting Genovese's plight to concepts like \"the bystander effect,\" and \"Kitty Genovese syndrome\" -- the idea that witnesses are less likely to step forward and help when they're part of a crowd, NPR reports. Local politicians rallied around a national emergency response system, which experts say led to a unified 911 protocol in 1968. Up until 911, New Yorkers could dial \"0\" for an operator and get in touch with their local precinct for help. \"The 911 system grows more or less directly from the outcry from Kitty Genovese\u2019s death,\" Kevin Cook, author of Kitty Genovese: The Murder, The Bystanders, The Crime that Changed America, told NPR in 2014. Moseley spent more than 50 years in prison and was denied parole 18 times, according to the Associated Press. He broke out of custody during a hospital visit in 1968, when he held hostages in Buffalo and raped a woman before he was recaptured three days later. \"I know that I did some terrible things, and I've tried very hard to atone for those things in prison,\" he said during a 2013 parole hearing, the AP reports. \"I think almost 50 years of paying for those crimes is enough.\"", "Good news for coffee drinkers: Drinking coffee could help colon cancer patients survive the deadly disease and prevent it from coming back after treatment, according to a new study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. In studying 1,000 patients with stage 3 colon cancer who had all been treated with surgery and chemotherapy, Dr. Charles Fuchs, director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center at the Boston-based Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, found that patients had the greatest benefits from drinking four or more cups of coffee a day. The patients were 42 percent less likely to have their cancer return than those who did not drink coffee and were 34 percent less likely to die from cancer or any other cause, the study found. Meanwhile, patients who drank three cups of coffee or less had more modest results. Though the results are encouraging, the institute said Fuchs is hesitant make any recommendations about coffee consumption in colon cancer patients until the results are confirmed by other studies. \"If you are a coffee drinker and are being treated for colon cancer, don't stop,\" he said in a new release. \"But if you're not a coffee drinker and wondering whether to start, you should first discuss it with your physician.\" The study, which Fuchs said is the first to draw an association between caffeinated coffee and the risk of colon cancer recurrence, joins a number of recent studies that suggest coffee may reduce the risk of other types of cancer, including postmenopausal breast cancer, melanoma, liver cancer and advanced prostate cancer. Not a fan of coffee? Fuchs said there are other ways to reduce the risk of cancer: avoid obesity, exercise regularly, adopt a healthier diet and eat nuts, which also reduce the risk of diabetes.", "Former President Benigno Simeon Aquino III now has plenty of time to spend with his sisters and their respective families.

Turns out, most of the vitamins we need are Turns out, most of the vitamins we need are already present in the food we eat \u2014 or at least in the food we should be eating. That's possible because our bodies only need minuscule amounts of them to function properly. How miniscule, you ask? \"We need vitamins in amounts so tiny that it's difficult to visualize them,\" writes science writer Catherine Price in her latest book, \" \"We need vitamins in amounts so tiny that it's difficult to visualize them,\" writes science writer Catherine Price in her latest book, \" Vitamania ,\" which explores how supplements transformed the way we think about food. In fact, for virtually all of the vitamins present in a standard multivitamin, the amount we're recommended to take daily is far smaller than a fraction of a grain of table salt. That's less than one of these teensy little specks: \u00a9 Provided by Business Insider table salt shaker grams Essential because our bodies require them but can't make sufficient quantities, which means we need to get them from outside sources, and micro because we only need them in really small amounts, typically fewer than 100 milligrams a day.\" Still, since the human body can't make them on their own, the effect of not getting these miniscule amounts is truly devastating. This is why vitamins are called essential micronutrients , Price explains. \"Essentialbecause our bodies require them but can't make sufficient quantities, which means we need to get them from outside sources, andmicrobecause we only need them in really small amounts, typically fewer than 100 milligrams a day.\" In many low-income countries, even these teensy quantities can be tough to come by, which is why organizations like the In many low-income countries, even these teensy quantities can be tough to come by, which is why organizations like the World Health Organization refer to them as \"magic wands .\" Not enough vitamin C, and deep purple bruises appear all over the body, the gums begin to bleed, you feel weak and tired and, eventually, if left untreated, Not enough vitamin C, and deep purple bruises appear all over the body, the gums begin to bleed, you feel weak and tired and, eventually, if left untreated, you can die . Not enough vitamin A, and night blindness can occur. But the amounts needed to prevent these horrific conditions is miniscule, as Price points out: The amount of folic acid that pregnant women are told to take to prevent devastating neurological defects in their babies is 240 micro grams a day, less than the weight of two grains of Morton salt. The Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin D, without which you won't be able to properly absorb calcium and your bones will soften, is 15 micrograms, one-sixteenth of that for folic acid. And the RDA for B12, a citmain whose deficiency can cause depression, delusions, memory loss, incontinence, nerve damage, and in extreme cases life-threatening anemia, is smaller still, just 2.4 microrams \u2014 0.0000024 grams. That's 1/100th the weight of the requirement for folic acid, the equivalent of 1/67th of one grain of salt. In developed countries, though, we often treat vitamins as a cure-all for everything from colds to fatigue. This is a big problem. Then solution to this problem, Price writes, is staggeringly simple: Eat better, and stop relying on a pill. As it turns out, most As it turns out, most green, leafy veggies are high in vitamins A, C, and E; colorful peppers and carrots are rich in vitamin A; fish and nuts are high in omega-3s; and avocados are a great source of potassium and vitamins C and E.

But if you want a more relaxing, stress-free evening, reflecting on the good stuff will go a long way. Findings from a study published in the Academy of Management Journal suggest that taking just a few minutes to reflect positively on the events of the day led to decreased stress -- and a healthier, more relaxed evening. Melissa Korn notes in the Wall Street Journal: It's no surprise that positive thinking can ease tension. But it might prove more practical than employers' current approaches for fighting workplace stress, such as offering flexible work arrangements or creating a new org chart that doesn't actually change daily life at the office, says Theresa Glomb, a work and organizations professor at University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management and co-author of the report. The experts at meQuilibrium teach that attempting to minimize or shrink stress isn't enough. You get stronger by flexing your attention muscle -- and controlling where it goes. And while the idea isn't to repress or ignore the bad stuff, it's well worth taking the time to acknowledge the good. Here's three ways to put this into practice before you head home. 1. Don't let one bad event rule the day. Every day has them: an awkward or uncomfortable moment with a coworker, a dressing down by the boss, a slip-up. It happens. But if you let that one moment define the day, you're doing what we call \"magnifying\" -- or exaggerating aspects of a situation and underestimating others. Recognize the discomfort -- and identify what good may come out of it. For every one less-than-stellar moment, think of two other good things that happened. And they don't have to be career changing. Having a great lunch with a friend counts. 2. Ask yourself why. Glomb told Korn that while listing good things is key, \"the real impact comes from writing down why those things led to good feelings. That act highlights the resources and support a person has in their work life -- such as skills, a good sense of humor, an encouraging family or a compassionate boss.\" If you felt positive about a meeting you had with a colleague, why? Was it because the exchange felt energized and promising, or was just a lot less painful than you expected? Maybe you felt productive, appreciated. Identify the why and you extend the benefits of the reflection. 3. Make it a habit. Okay, you did it! Now the key is to do this tomorrow. And the next day. Decide what you can do to make this ritual simple, quick, and meaningful. What tools appeal to you? Perhaps you love jotting things down in your Moleskine notebook (I do love the feel of a roller pen across those smooth pages). If you're digitally inclined, there are loads of productivity apps out there. But one I have personally used for years is iDoneThis -- it's the inverse of a to-do list. Your to-DONE list is where you put in what you got done today. The web interface is refreshingly simple and plain. It shoots you an email at whatever time of day you like, and asks you to take five minutes to jot down what you got done. Reply to the email and it populates the cloud-based calendar on your computer or handheld app. Or you can input in the app directly. (You can also use this tool to track team accomplishments.) Don't forget to add the \"why\" or a line or two about why this matters, to get the full benefit of the day's reflection. Building balanced awareness of your day also matters. And that's why another thing worth doing is noting where your emotions and mood take you off the rails (which undoubtedly results in the less-than-stellar moments). Check out meQ's own app, which is designed to let you track your moods and emotions throughout the day. When you're aware of where things go awry, you'll be more capable of addressing them -- and feeling better about it. Want to dramatically reduce your stress? Take our 28-day challenge.

It seemed that there were no questions he could pose that she wasn't willing to answer honestly. When asked who was a better kisser out of Patrick Dempsey and Chris O'Donnell, she quickly answered Dempsey. As for why? \"We don\u2019t have that much time,\" Pompeo said. Of T.R. Knight, Katherine Heigl and Isaiah Washington, Pompeo said she missed Heigl and Knight the most -- it was a tie. \"T.R. and Katie are kind of the same person,\" she said. \"They\u2019re a sandwich.\" When asked who was the \"bigger bitch\" to work with out of Heigl and Washington, Pompeo said, \"Isaiah all the way!\" Washington was famously let go from the show after using homophobic slurs against castmate Knight. And Heigl left very publicly after she insulted the show's quality. That drama recently came back to haunt the actress in a Hollywood Reporter piece about how difficult she is to work with. A caller wanted to know if Pompeo thought Heigl would ever return to \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and Pompeo basically said, \"No.\" She said that Heigl has a deal for a new CIA-themed series with NBC. The show is currently in development and Pompeo sent \"much love\" to her former co-star, saying that she can't wait to see it. As for her show, Pompeo ranked the \"Grey's Anatomy\" musical episode below the one where Izzie had sex with Denny's ghost, though many fans believe they were equally awful, with still others having a soft spot for the weirdness that was that musical episode. Pompeo also addressed some controversy over comments she made about the Emmys. She was quoted as calling the show \"disappointing,\" noting that it \"lacked diversity.\" But she told Cohen that her comments were made \"off the record\" -- as in while she was walking from the elevator into an interview.

Jean began his answer by saying the team behind \"The Simpsons\" could never actually reveal that, but then continued with a hint that was more or less an admission. During a press conference call promoting the series\u2019 new season that began last Sunday, a reporter from MyNewYorkEye bluntly asked executive producer Al Jean, \"Where is Springfield? Do you want to tell which state Springfield is in?\" So by this point, with \"The Simpsons\" entering its 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery, any clue as to where the real Springfield is could be noteworthy. The Simpson family has resided in the American town of Springfield for nearly three decades. But despite millions of fellow Americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their \"Springfield\" actually is. The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family\u2019s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location. Groening has actually said in the past that the Springfield in the show was named after Springfield, Oregon, but didn\u2019t go so far as to admit \"street names and locations\" were, as well. In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece \"Matt Groening Reveals the Location of the Real Springfield.\" Here\u2019s part of the piece that gets into the Oregon connection: OK, why do the Simpsons live in a town called Springfield? Isn\u2019t that a little generic? Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show \"Father Knows Best\" took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, \"This will be cool; everyone will think it\u2019s their Springfield.\" And they do. You\u2019ve never said it was named after Springfield, Oregon, before, have you? I don\u2019t want to ruin it for people, you know? Whenever people say it\u2019s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, \"Yup, that\u2019s right.\" This article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both Groening and Jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. The show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where Bart Simpson repeatedly wrote, \"The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours.\" Jean told Jean told TV Guide at the time that Smithsonian Magazine \"misinterpreted something [he has] heard [Groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years.\" Jean continued, \"He was inspired by growing up in Portland, but it\u2019s really an every town. It\u2019s really funny. Matt grew up in Oregon and parts of \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 were definitely inspired by his childhood. But there is no specific state that Springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret.\" Further trying to dispel that Groening revealed the location, Jean reminded TV Guide readers that \"The Simpsons Movie\" hinted that the town\u2019s true whereabouts are geographically impossible. \"In the movie we say [Springfield] borders on Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky,\" said Jean. \"So good luck finding that state. When you do, you\u2019re a true \u2018Simpsons\u2019 fan.\" For what it\u2019s worth, Ohio has a city named Oregon. The state of Oregon does border Nevada. The city of Portland, Oregon, was named after the city of Portland, Maine. And there is an unincorporated community that calls itself \"Oregon\" in Kentucky. In a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to Oregon. \"The Simpsons\" Springfield = Springfield, Oregon. The homepage of the official website for the Oregonian city even claims, \"Yes, this is the \u2018real\u2019 Springfield from \u2018The Simpsons.\u2019\" Of course, even if this is true, Jean and Groening will likely never fully admit it. Jean continued his answer about Springfield, Oregon, during the press conference by saying, \"But the great thing about [the show\u2019s city] is it\u2019s universal. I grew up in Michigan, and I can totally relate to it. Anybody, wherever you\u2019re from, has a Springfield near them.\" The people of Oregon are just especially close.

I'm a person who enjoys cooking anyway, and it was important to me to provide him with fresh, healthy produce. When I thought about it, eating baby food wasn't a bad idea idea. After all, many of the world's most beloved foods are enjoyed in their squished form. Guacamole is perfection. Applesauce is awesome. Hummus is great. And who doesn't love mashed potatoes? Plus, I've been enough to fancy restaurants where entrees are served atop puddles of parsnip mash or dollops of spring pea pure\u0301e. This wasn't mere baby food I was creating \u2014 it was cutting-edge cuisine! At first, the pure\u0301es I ate were terrific, like downing super thick smoothies for every meal. And it really did save a lot of time, which otherwise would have been spent over the stove or cleaning the dishes. The bonus was that it forced me to be more creative with the things I whipped up in the blender, because I wanted to consume delicious things too. Snap peas, pears and a banana? Tasty. Sweet potatoes, cherries and vanilla? Like a party in my mouth. Fava beans and summer squash with leeks? Eh, not the worst. After a week of baby food; however, eating became something laborious. It was no longer interesting or enjoyable. I fantasized about crunch. Chewing felt like an old friend I only vaguely remembered. I realized I was on the diet of someone who just had his wisdom teeth pulled, but for no real reason. That's the day I decided to reverse the process: Instead of eating what my baby eats, I would simply give him what I like to eat. It's a strategy that has worked well for us ever since, with a food repertoire that has expanded to include soft grilled eggplant, five-bean chili, rice pudding, roasted veggies of all kinds, aloo gobi and pillows of naan. We didn't want to be those culinary snobs who go to a restaurant and just order the parsnip pure\u0301e, anyway.", "(Adult Swim)A screengrab from an episode of \"Rick and Morty.\" Rumors have it that Beth and Jerry's marital problems may be put to an end in the highly anticipated season 3 of Adult Swim's \"Rick and Morty.\" It can be recalled that Beth had given up on her dreams on becoming a surgeon when she gave birth to Summer at the age of 17. Her marriage has also been on the rocks since the freshman run, as featured in the episodes \"Rixty Minutes\" and \"Rick Potion Number 9\" when the pair went through couple's therapy on another planet. The sophomore run also did not fix the problems between them. Even some alien characters pointed out how toxic their relationship was in both \"Auto Erotic Assimilation\" and \"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez.\" Despite their many misunderstandings, all of the aforementioned installments ended up with Beth and Jerry still together. According to Geek, their marriage may finally see some leeway in the new run. In the commentary track for the season 2 DVD, co-creator Dan Harmon admitted that the premise of the Smith's unsteady connection is wearing thin. \"I thought that Jerry and Beth getting a divorce would be like Kenny being killed in 'South Park,' like, when we first conceived the show... that it would never run out of shelf life that that was the kind of joke of like, oh all our parents were about to get a divorce,\" he mused. However, he stated that the viewers may see the narrative making progress, especially in case of Beth, \"But, I think Millennial viewers are like, 'I don't understand, why don't they just recycle more?' So, season three we kind of move the Beth story forward.\" Elsewhere, there are also speculations that new villains will be introduced starting with a touted Evil Morty in the premiere. As Rick Sanchez breaks out of prison, he will apparently be captured by his grandson's alter ego. Other characters such as Mr. Meeseeks and Mr. Poopybutthole are predicted to aid Summer and Morty in getting rid of the antagonist. Since there is no official announcement yet, available information should be taken with a grain of salt. Season 3 of \"Rick and Morty\" is expected to air later this year.", "[WARNING: Adult language] Friday on \"CNN Tonight,\" network host Fareed Zakaria said President Donald Trump has succeeded by \"bullshitting.\" Zakaria said, \"I think the president is somewhat indifferent to things that are true or false. He has spent his whole life bullshitting. He has succeeded by bullshitting. He has gotten the presidency by bullshitting. It\u2019s very hard to tell somebody at that point that bullshit doesn\u2019t work because look at results. Right?  But that\u2019s what he does. He sees something he doesn\u2019t particularly care if it\u2019s true or not. Just puts it out there and then he puts something else out. Notice again at the press conference, when pushed on it, does take responsibility. \u2018I wasn\u2019t saying that just quoting somebody else.\u2019 When you have the White House press secretary quote somebody to prove a point, you\u2019re endorsing that view.\"", "You get all kinds of happiness advice on the internet from people who don't know what they're talking about. Don't trust them. Actually, don't trust me either. Trust neuroscientists. They study that gray blob in your head all day and have learned a lot about what truly will make you happy. UCLA neuroscience researcher Alex Korb has some insights that can create an upward spiral of happiness in your life. Here's what you and I can learn from the people who really have answers: 1. The most important question to ask when you feel down Sometimes it doesn't feel like your brain wants you to be happy. You may feel guilty or shameful. Why? Believe it or not, guilt and shame activate the brain's reward center. Despite their differences, pride, shame, and guilt all activate similar neural circuits, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, insula, and the nucleus accumbens. Interestingly, pride is the most powerful of these emotions at triggering activity in these regions \u2014 except in the nucleus accumbens, where guilt and shame win out. This explains why it can be so appealing to heap guilt and shame on ourselves \u2014 they're activating the brain's reward center. And you worry a lot, too. Why? In the short term, worrying makes your brain feel a little better \u2014 at least you're doing something about your problems. In fact, worrying can help calm the limbic system by increasing activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and decreasing activity in the amygdala. That might seem counterintuitive, but it just goes to show that if you're feeling anxiety, doing something about it \u2014 even worrying \u2014 is better than doing nothing. But guilt, shame, and worry are horrible, long-term solutions. So what do neuroscientists say you should do? Ask yourself this question: What am I grateful for? Yeah, gratitude is awesome ... but does it really affect your brain at the biological level? Yup. You know what the antidepressant Wellbutrin does? Boosts the neurotransmitter dopamine. So does gratitude. The benefits of gratitude start with the dopamine system, because feeling grateful activates the brain stem region that produces dopamine. Additionally, gratitude toward others increases activity in social dopamine circuits, which makes social interactions more enjoyable ... Know what Prozac does? Boosts the neurotransmitter serotonin. So does gratitude. One powerful effect of gratitude is that it can boost serotonin. Trying to think of things you are grateful for forces you to focus on the positive aspects of your life. This simple act increases serotonin production in the anterior cingulate cortex. I know, sometimes life lands a really mean punch in the gut and it feels like there's nothing to be grateful for. Guess what? Doesn't matter. You don't have to find anything. It's the searching that counts. It's not finding gratitude that matters most; it's remembering to look in the first place. Remembering to be grateful is a form of emotional intelligence. One study found that it actually affected neuron density in both the ventromedial and lateral prefrontal cortex. These density changes suggest that as emotional intelligence increases, the neurons in these areas become more efficient. With higher emotional intelligence, it simply takes less effort to be grateful. And gratitude doesn't just make your brain happy \u2014 it can also create a positive feedback loop in your relationships. So express that gratitude to the people you care about.

When you're really in the dumps and don't even know how to deal with it? There's an easy answer ... 2. Label negative feelings You feel awful. OK, give that awfulness a name. Sad? Anxious? Angry? Boom. It's that simple. Sound stupid? Your noggin disagrees. [I]n one fMRI study, appropriately titled \"Putting Feelings into Words\" participants viewed pictures of people with emotional facial expressions. Predictably, each participant's amygdala activated to the emotions in the picture. But when they were asked to name the emotion, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activated and reduced the emotional amygdala reactivity. In other words, consciously recognizing the emotions reduced their impact. Suppressing emotions doesn't work and can backfire on you. Via Your Brain at Work: Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long: Gross found that people who tried to suppress a negative emotional experience failed to do so. While they thought they looked fine outwardly, inwardly their limbic system was just as aroused as without suppression, and in some cases, even more aroused. Kevin Ochsner, at Columbia, repeated these findings using an fMRI. Trying not to feel something doesn't work, and in some cases even backfires. But labeling, on the other hand, makes a big difference. Via Your Brain at Work: Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long: To reduce arousal, you need to use just a few words to describe an emotion, and ideally use symbolic language, which means using indirect metaphors, metrics, and simplifications of your experience. This requires you to activate your prefrontal cortex, which reduces the arousal in the limbic system. Here's the bottom line: describe an emotion in just a word or two, and it helps reduce the emotion. Ancient methods were way ahead of us on this one. Meditation has employed this for centuries. Labeling is a fundamental tool of mindfulness. In fact, labeling affects the brain so powerfully it works with other people, too. Labeling emotions is one of the primary tools used by FBI hostage negotiators. Okay, hopefully you're not reading this and labeling your current emotional state as bored. Maybe you're not feeling awful but you probably have things going on in your life that are causing you some stress. Here's a simple way to beat them. 3. Make that decision Ever make a decision and then your brain finally feels at rest? That's no random occurrence. Brain science shows that making decisions reduces worry and anxiety \u2014 as well as helping you solve problems. Making decisions includes creating intentions and setting goals \u2014 all three are part of the same neural circuitry and engage the prefrontal cortex in a positive way, reducing worry and anxiety. Making decisions also helps overcome striatum activity, which usually pulls you toward negative impulses and routines. Finally, making decisions changes your perception of the world \u2014 finding solutions to your problems and calming the limbic system. But deciding can be hard. I agree. So what kind of decisions should you make? Neuroscience has an answer. Make a \"good enough\" decision. Don't sweat making the absolute 100% best decision. We all know being a perfectionist can be stressful. And brain studies back this up. Trying to be perfect overwhelms your brain with emotions and makes you feel out of control. Trying for the best, instead of good enough, brings too much emotional ventromedial prefrontal activity into the decision-making process. In contrast, recognizing that good enough is good enough activates more dorsolateral prefrontal areas, which helps you feel more in control ... As Swarthmore professor Barry Schwartz said in my interview with him: \"Good enough is almost always good enough.\" So when you make a decision, your brain feels you have control. And, as I\u2019ve talked about before, a feeling of control reduces stress. But here\u2019s what\u2019s really fascinating: Deciding also boosts pleasure. Actively choosing caused changes in attention circuits and in how the participants felt about the action, and it increased rewarding dopamine activity. Want proof? No problem. Let's talk about cocaine. You give two rats injections of cocaine. Rat A had to pull a lever first. Rat B didn't have to do anything. Any difference? Yup: Rat A gets a bigger boost of dopamine. So they both got the same injections of cocaine at the same time, but rat A had to actively press the lever, and rat B didn\u2019t have to do anything. And you guessed it \u2014 rat A released more dopamine in its nucleus accumbens. So what's the lesson here? Next time you buy cocaine ... whoops, wrong lesson. Point is, when you make a decision on a goal and then achieve it, you feel better than when good stuff just happens by chance. And this answers the eternal mystery of why dragging your butt to the gym can be so hard. If you go because you feel you have to or you should, well, it's not really a voluntary decision. Your brain doesn't get the pleasure boost. It just feels stress. And that's no way to build a good exercise habit. Interestingly, if they are forced to exercise, they don't get the same benefits, because without choice, the exercise itself is a source of stress. So make more decisions. Neuroscience researcher Alex Korb sums it up nicely: We don't just choose the things we like; we also like the things we choose.

Great, but this is feeling kinda lonely for a happiness prescription. Let's get some other people in here. What's something you can do with others that neuroscience says is a path to mucho happiness? And something that's stupidly simple so you don't get lazy and skip it? Brain docs have an answer for you. 4. Touch people No, not indiscriminately; that can get you in a lot of trouble. But we need to feel love and acceptance from others. When we don't it's painful. And I don't mean \"awkward\" or \"disappointing.\" I mean actually painful. Neuroscientists did a study where people played a ball-tossing video game. The other players tossed the ball to you and you tossed it back to them. Actually, there were no other players; that was all done by the computer program. But the subjects were told the characters were controlled by real people. So what happened when the \"other players\" stopped playing nice and didn't share the ball? Subjects' brains responded the same way as if they experienced physical pain. Rejection doesn't just hurt like a broken heart; your brain feels it like a broken leg. In fact, as demonstrated in an fMRI experiment, social exclusion activates the same circuitry as physical pain ... at one point they stopped sharing, only throwing back and forth to each other, ignoring the participant. This small change was enough to elicit feelings of social exclusion, and it activated the anterior cingulate and insula, just like physical pain would. Relationships are important to your brain's feeling of happiness. Want to take that to the next level? Touch people. One of the primary ways to release oxytocin is through touching. Obviously, it's not always appropriate to touch most people, but small touches like handshakes and pats on the back are usually okay. For people you're close with, make more of an effort to touch more often. Touching is incredibly powerful. We just don't give it enough credit. It makes you more persuasive, increases team performance, improves your flirting ... heck, it even boosts math skills. Touching someone you love actually reduces pain. In fact, when studies were done on married couples, the stronger the marriage, the more powerful the effect. In addition, holding hands with someone can help comfort you and your brain through painful situations. One fMRI study scanned married women as they were warned that they were about to get a small electric shock. While anticipating the painful shocks, the brain showed a predictable pattern of response in pain and worrying circuits, with activation in the insula, anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. During a separate scan, the women either held their husbands' hands or the hand of the experimenter. When a subject held her husband's hand, the threat of shock had a smaller effect. The brain showed reduced activation in both the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \u2014 that is, less activity in the pain and worrying circuits. In addition, the stronger the marriage, the lower the discomfort-related insula activity. So hug someone today. And do not accept little, quick hugs. No, no, no. Tell them your neuroscientist recommended long hugs. A hug, especially a long one, releases a neurotransmitter and hormone oxytocin, which reduces the reactivity of the amygdala. Research shows getting five hugs a day for four weeks increases happiness big time. Don't have anyone to hug right now? No? (I'm sorry to hear that. I would give you a hug right now if I could.) But there's an answer: Neuroscience says you should go get a massage. The results are fairly clear that massage boosts your serotonin by as much as 30 percent. Massage also decreases stress hormones and raises dopamine levels, which helps you create new good habits ... Massage reduces pain because the oxytocin system activates painkilling endorphins. Massage also improves sleep and reduces fatigue by increasing serotonin and dopamine and decreasing the stress hormone cortisol. So spend time with other people and give some hugs. Sorry, texting is not enough. When you put people in a stressful situation and then let them visit loved ones or talk to them on the phone, they felt better. What about when they just texted? Their bodies responded the same as if they had no support at all. [T]he text-message group had cortisol and oxytocin levels similar to the no-contact group. Author's note: I totally approve of texting if you make a hug appointment. To learn what neuroscience says is the best way to get smarter and happier, click here. OK, I don't want to strain your brain with too much info. Let's round it up and learn the quickest and easiest way to start that upward spiral of neuroscience-inspired happiness. Sum up Here's what brain research says will make you happy: Ask \"What am I grateful for?\" No answers? Doesn't matter. Just searching helps. No answers? Doesn't matter. Just searching helps. Label those negative emotions. Give it a name and your brain isn't so bothered by it. Give it a name and your brain isn't so bothered by it. Decide. Go for \"good enough\" instead of 'best decision ever made on Earth.\" Go for \"good enough\" instead of 'best decision ever made on Earth.\" Hugs, hugs, hugs. Don't text \u2014 touch. So what's the simple way to start that upward spiral of happiness? Just send someone a thank-you email. If you feel awkward about it, you can send them this post to tell them why. This really can start an upward spiral of happiness in your life. UCLA neuroscience researcher Alex Korb explains: Everything is interconnected. Gratitude improves sleep. Sleep reduces pain. Reduced pain improves your mood. Improved mood reduces anxiety, which improves focus and planning. Focus and planning help with decision making. Decision making further reduces anxiety and improves enjoyment. Enjoyment gives you more to be grateful for, which keeps that loop of the upward spiral going. Enjoyment also makes it more likely you'll exercise and be social, which, in turn, will make you happier. So thank you for reading this. And send that thank-you email now to make you and someone you care about happy.", "You've probably heard at least one story about a crazy uncle leaving some pretty amazing, unexpected items to a relative, but this one has to beat them all. In 2009, the eccentric and brilliant uncle of a brother and sister in Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom passed away, leaving them the deed to a dusty old garage. Apparently, the late doctor had been a hoarder, so the siblings assumed they were just tasked with cleaning up a huge mess, but when they opened up the garage door, they were shocked at what they found. Wikimedia Dr. Harold Carr was a life-long eccentric and became a bit of recluse in his later years, so, while his family knew he kept cars, they had no idea what kind of vehicles he'd been collecting over the years. His nephew told The Mirror that. \"It was a bit of local folklore that he had a Bugatti, but no one knew for sure, and certainly no one knew what it was worth.\" The 1937 Bugatti Type 57S was found in the garage, amid piles of medical machinery, 1,500 beer steins, thousands of receipts and even a World War II spy drone. And, it was sold at auction for more than \u00a33 million, or just over 4.3 million USD. Carr had purchased the vehicle over a half-century earlier at a cost of \u00a3895 - the equivalent of \u00a315,500 today, or around $22,200. Paul Cooper via MailOnline It is highly coveted by collectors as only 17 were ever made and at least four of those are thought to belong to the Musee Nationale de L'Automobile in Mulhouse, France. The nephew who wished to remain anonymous also told Mail Online, \"We knew he had some cars, but we had no idea what they were. \"It was a bit of local folklore that he had a Bugatti, but no one knew for sure. It's worth so much because he hasn't used it for 50 years. It was one of the original supercars. \"When it was built it could reach 130mph at a time when other cars could only do 50mph. Of course we are delighted and we're going to make sure the money is shared out among the family. It's a wonderful thing to leave.\" He also described his uncle, explaining that he was \"a very eccentric old gent,\" adding, \"I suppose you could call him a mad doctor. People who saw him in the street thought he was a tramp. He would wear two pairs of trousers at the same time.\" Bonhams via MailOnline In his later years, the doctor was said to have suffered from a form of obsessive compulsive disorder and hoarded everything in the house he refused to leave. Files were piled six feet high at his home, and they even included receipts for pencils he purchased in the 1950s. \"Since he died, it has taken me 18 months to get where I am today,\" the nephew said. He also added that his uncle, while a bit strange, was \"a very generous man.\"", "Because an actor isn't truly an actor until they're rumored for a role in \"Star Wars,\" Chiwetel Ejiofor is the latest name to surface as a potential participant in J.J. Abrams' \"Star Wars: Episode VII.\" As relayed by Times of London writer Rhys Blakely (via Bleeding Cool), Ejiofor was recently spotted at Abrams' office, which is now enough to start speculation about \"Star Wars.\" For his part, Abrams refused to discuss whether Ejiofor was involved in the \"Episode VII\" casting merry-go-round, but he did tell Blakely that the \"12 Years A Slave\" star was \"a very talented gentleman.\" Ejiofor is just the latest actor to have his or her name attached to \"Episode VII\" discussion, joining the ranks of Benedict Cumberbatch, Saoirse Ronan and Alex Pettyfer. Even original players Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are still only rumored for the sequel, as their involvement has not been confirmed in an official capacity just yet. \"I mean, everybody's going in on this project. They're trying to figure out what they want,\" Michael B. Jordan, who admitted to the Associated Press that he also auditioned for \"Star Wars,\" said back in October. \"Everyone who wants to be part of that film, they know about,\" Cumberbatch told The Hollywood Reporter when the subject of his \"Star Wars\" rumor was broached in a recent interview. For now, Abrams is busy writing the script for \"Episode VII\" with Lawrence Kasdan (Oscar winner Michael Arndt, who was hired to write \"Episode VII\" in November of last year, left the project at the end of October). The film is expected to arrive in theaters in 2015.", "A 16-year-old from Nebraska who pleaded guilty to throwing her newborn out a window was sentenced on Friday to probation and ordered to live in a group home. Douglas County Juvenile Court Judge Christopher Kelly also told Antonia Lopez that she must receive therapy, delete her Facebook account, and perform 50 hours of community service, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Police say she gave birth September 30 at her mother\u2019s apartment in Omaha before she threw the child out the window. Lopez then told her mother, who called 911 after she found the child. The baby was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Lopez reportedly messaged her boyfriend on Snapchat after the infant\u2019s death, saying, \"It was a girl by the way,\" the New York Post reported. An autopsy revealed that the child was in her seventh month of development and suffered bleeding near her skull, brain, spine, and abdomen from the blunt-force trauma. Lopez was initially going to be charged as an adult with one count of felony child abuse resulting in death, a charge that carries a sentence of 20 years to life in prison. The case was transferred to juvenile court after the district attorney\u2019s office took into account her mental state, actions, and lack of criminal record. Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine said Lopez did not plan her actions, which were more of a \"panicked reaction.\" Lopez told a police detective that she did not know she was pregnant and thought she was just having her period when she woke up in pain. Lopez\u2019s boyfriend, however, told officers that she was pregnant and that he had urged her to let her mother know about the pregnancy and see a doctor.", "You've spent hours preparing a delicious meal, and now your dishwasher can do the dirty--er, clean--work. But the machine can't quite do its job if you're not loading it right. Here's the number one mistake you might be making. What you're doing wrong: Placing your spoons and forks with the handles facing up, and wedged way up against each other. Why that approach sucks: In most dishwashers, the water shoots up from the middle. When your spoons are spooning face-down, the water and soap can't really reach all that crusty lasagna and filmy yogurt. How to do it right: Place utensils with handles facing down.

Place those guys sharp-side down, so you don't end up stabbing yourself when you go to unload.", "Suzanne, a young woman in San Francisco, met a man\u2014call him John\u2014on the dating site OKCupid. John was attractive and charming. More notably, he indulged in the kind of profligate displays of affection which signal a definite eagerness to commit. He sneaked Suzanne\u2019s favorite snacks into her purse as a workday surprise and insisted early on that she keep a key to his apartment. He asked her to help him choose a couch and then spooned with her on all the floor models. He even accompanied her, unprompted, to the D.M.V.\u2014an act roughly equivalent, in today\u2019s gallantry currency, to Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea monster. As we learn from the podcast \"Reply All,\" which reported the tale, Suzanne was not the only woman on whom John had chosen to bestow his favor. Six months into their relationship, she discovered that he was seeing half a dozen other women, one of whom he\u2019d been stringing along for two years. All of them had received the couch-spooning treatment. John was a champion girlfriend accumulator, the ringmaster of a romantic circus that only he could see. Every so often, one of his paramours would catch on and alert the others. Then he\u2019d block them all on social media and begin the whole thing again. In one sense, this is a story about the exploitative possibilities of online matchmaking: the opportunities to flagrantly misrepresent oneself, the ease of trawling for specific targets. (John, who was white, pursued only Asian women, leaving his girlfriends with the icky sense that they\u2019d been fetishized as well as deceived.) Still, romantic scammers aren\u2019t an invention of modern courtship and its digital devices. They\u2019re a staple of Jane Austen novels: John Willoughby, who caddishly breaks Marianne\u2019s heart in \"Sense and Sensibility\"; George Wickham, who reels in both Lizzy and Lydia Bennett in \"Pride and Prejudice\"; Frank Churchill, in \"Emma,\" who flirts with Miss Woodhouse while being secretly engaged to her frenemy, Jane Fairfax. John, though, was a stranger breed of seducer. As a twenty-first-century guy living in one of the most culturally liberal of American cities, he had options available to him that men in Regency England did not. He could have chosen to be a player, sleeping around with abandon, or the kind of cheater who supplements monogamy with a series of flings. He might have practiced polyamory, consensual open love. But John, with his flair for saccharine cuteness and his insistence on treating his conquests like romantic-comedy heroines, didn\u2019t like just to play or cheat, and he certainly didn\u2019t like any of his girlfriends to suspect that they didn\u2019t have his full attention. What he liked to do was date. According to Moira Weigel, the author of \"Labor of Love: The Invention of Dating\" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), most people are not like John in this respect. However much you might enjoy going out to dinner or stumbling home with someone new, you date in the hope that the day will come when you\u2019ll never have to date again. \"If marriage is the long-term contract that many daters still hope to land, dating itself often feels like the worst, most precarious form of contemporary labor: an unpaid internship,\" Weigel writes at the start of her book. The process of testing out potential mates, and of being tested by them in turn, can be gruelling, bewildering, humiliating. Using another metaphor, Weigel compares the experience to being cast in a bad piece of experimental theatre: \"You and a partner showed up every night with different, conflicting scripts. You did your best.\" This makes dating sound a lot like a recurring anxiety dream. You\u2019d have to be a masochist not to try to wake yourself up. Weigel, who is in her early thirties, is a Ph.D. candidate in comparative literature, film, and media at Yale; \"Labor of Love,\" a perceptive and wide-ranging investigation into the history of dating in America, is her first book, sprouted from the seed of unpleasant personal experience. At twenty-six, she was involved with an older man who was torn between her and an ex he hadn\u2019t lost interest in. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t choose either of them; he told Weigel that he found the whole premise of long-term romance \"ideologically suspect.\" She realized that she had no idea what she herself wanted from romance. Her Irish Catholic mother and the self-help industry told her that the goal should be marriage, and soon. She asked her sort-of boyfriend for his opinion. He thought that everyone should want to pursue happiness. Weigel had a revelation: she was always turning to a man to tell her what she was after, and the institution of dating was to blame. It trained women \"in how to be if we wanted to be wanted.\" Hence \"Labor of Love,\" an exploration of that training, in which Weigel reaches two main conclusions. The first is that though dating is passed off as a leisure activity, it really is a lot of work, particularly for women. It requires physical effort\u2014all that primping, exercising, shopping, and grooming\u2014as well as sizable investments of time, money, and emotion. In our consumer society, love is perpetually for sale; dating is what it takes to close the deal. Her second conclusion is that the way we consume love changes to reflect the economy of the times. The monogamy of the booming postwar fifties offered \"a kind of romantic full employment,\" while the free love of the sixties signified not the death of dating but its deregulation on the free market. The luxury- and self-obsessed yuppies of the \"greed is good\" eighties demanded that the romantic market deliver partners tailored to their niche specifications, developing early versions of the kinds of matchmaking services that have been perfected in today\u2019s digital gig economy, where the personal is professional, and everyone self-brands accordingly. Dating is therefore a powerful force of social control\u2014but what do we actually mean by \"dating\"? Weigel begins her survey at the turn of the twentieth century, when single women were increasingly leaving the towns and farms where they\u2019d been brought up and flocking to industrializing cities to work in factories, laundries, and department stores, their ranks swelled by the arrival of immigrants. Domestic privacy was hard to come by. Working women bunked in tenements with relatives or streamed into boarding houses with rules against male visitors. So they went out, to parks and dance halls, saloons and restaurants, nickelodeons and penny arcades\u2014to the streets themselves, teeming centers of working-class social life\u2014where they could have a good time and meet men on their own. There were a lot of men to meet. The term \"date\" originated as slang referring to a woman\u2019s date book, and showed up in print in 1896, in \"Stories of the Streets and Town,\" a Chicago Record column that offered middle-class readers a taste of working-class life. Artie, a young clerk, confronts a girlfriend who\u2019s been giving him the slip: \"I s\u2019pose the other boy\u2019s fillin\u2019 all my dates?\" He wasn\u2019t always so begrudging. A later column reports Artie\u2019s admiring observation that a certain girl\u2019s date book was so full she had to keep it \"on the Double Entry System.\" Not surprisingly, these new female freedoms came with a catch. The pursuit of leisure cost more than most single working-class women (paid a fraction of what men were) could readily afford. Weigel quotes a 1915 report by a New York social worker: \"The acceptance on the part of the girl of almost any invitation needs little explanation, when one realizes that she often goes pleasureless unless she accepts \u2018free treats.\u2019 \" To have fun, a woman had to let a man pay for her and suffer the resultant damage to her reputation. Daters were \"Charity Girls\"\u2014\"Charity Cunts,\" in a dictionary of sexual terms published in 1916\u2014so called because they gave themselves away for free. Dating thus amounted to a double bind. If women went out, they were seen as akin to whores, who at least got cash for their trouble\u2014a distinction that was lost on the police, who regularly arrested female daters for prostitution. On the other hand, if women stayed in they couldn\u2019t bump into eligible bachelors. In \"All the Single Ladies: Unmarried Women and the Rise of an Independent Nation\" (Simon & Schuster), the journalist Rebecca Traister describes the attempts of one establishment, the Trowmart Inn, in Greenwich Village, to address this problem. Unlike most boarding houses for working women, the Trowmart didn\u2019t impose a curfew, and actively encouraged male visitors. The Times reported that its founder wanted to give women of \"the class which labors for a small wage\" a place where they could be courted with the kind of decorousness that the dating scene lacked: \"Girls of gentleness and refinement do not care to be courted upon the open highway, nor in public parks, and thus the world is filling with spinsters who . . . had they a proper place in which to entertain their admirers, would develop into happy, excellent wives and still happier mothers.\" What the Trowmart founder had in mind was \"calling,\" the respectable mode of courtship that had been practiced during the nineteenth century and into the twentieth by the aspirational middle class. After a girl came out into society, around the age of sixteen, her guardian would invite young men to call on her at home. They would chat; she might play something on the piano. In subsequent \"seasons,\" girls were permitted to extend invitations themselves. Calling had rules, which were publicized by women\u2019s magazines like Harper\u2019s Bazaar and Ladies\u2019 Home Journal. A man should call within a fortnight of receiving an invitation. A girl\u2019s mother must chaperone the first visit but eventually leave the couple alone. A young lady should never walk her guest to the front door. Compared with dating, calling sounds unbearably repressive. Weigel points out that it turned women, primly cloistered in their drawing rooms, into passive objects of male desire. (In \"The Glass Menagerie,\" Amanda Wingfield, with her fantasy of a \"gentleman caller,\" suggests the more destructive effects of this philosophy.) And the rules were firm. In 1907, Ladies\u2019 Home Journal instructed women never to go to a restaurant in the company of a man. Think of the opening scene of Edith Wharton\u2019s \"The House of Mirth,\" published in 1905 and set a decade earlier, in which Lily Bart, a single woman struggling to keep her place among New York\u2019s e\u0301lite, agrees to take tea at the apartment of the lawyer Lawrence Selden, a single man. You don\u2019t have to read any further to know that the novel will end in her ruin. But calling gave women certain advantages. As the historian Beth L. Bailey argued in a 1988 book on courtship in twentieth-century America, calling, which took place in the female \"sphere\" of the home, afforded women a degree of control that dating in the public, male sphere didn\u2019t. Plus, it was up to women to pursue men. Bailey quotes a young man\u2019s letter that was published in Ladies\u2019 Home Journal in 1909: \"May I call upon a young woman whom I greatly admire, although she had not given me permission?\" Not if he wanted to have a chance with her, came the reply. Compare this, as Bailey does, with the warning issued in a dating guide from the nineteen-fifties\u2014representative of a genre that has survived with roachlike endurance to the present day\u2014that for girls to ask guys out would be \"to usurp the right of boys to choose their own dates,\" a custom that the guide claimed stretched back to the Stone Age, when, readers were blithely informed, men regarded women as prey and took them by force. The shift from calling to dating happened quickly, in the way that such shifts often do. The rich copied the poor; the middle class copied the rich. In 1914, Ladies\u2019 Home Journal reported that it was now \"considered \u2018smart\u2019 to go to the low order of dance halls, and not only be a looker-on, but also to dance among all sorts and conditions of men and women.\" The sense of social liberation was hardly shared by all. Weigel notes the Harlem Renaissance writer Wallace Thurman\u2019s observation, in the mid-nineteen-twenties, that his neighborhood\u2019s night clubs had become de-facto segregated \"shrines\" to which self-styled white sophisticates made pilgrimage on their nights out. The upper crust flocked, too, to drag shows and gay burlesques, part of a long tradition of straight daters cribbing from gay life. (Just as, in more recent history, Tinder launched on the heels of Grindr, so were the straight singles bars of the sixties inspired by gay nightspots. One of the most popular of these franchises still thrives, albeit in much altered form, under its original name: T.G.I. Friday\u2019s.) Soon enough, dating became an activity by which women tried to transcend class. By the nineteen-tens and twenties, as it became commonplace for women to work in public as shopgirls, laundresses, and waitresses, the hope of \"dating up\" by snagging middle-class customers to go out with, and, eventually, marry, became a trope\u2014one that largely excluded working-class black women, the majority of whom were restricted to jobs as maids. To sell themselves as romantic prospects along with whatever else they were selling, girls cultivated a certain look\u2014makeup, recently the province of actresses and prostitutes, went mainstream\u2014and a certain style: solicitous, flirtatious, credulous, coy. Fast-forward a few decades and you get Helen Gurley Brown, self-appointed patron saint to single girls, impressing upon female office workers the importance of not leaving \"any facet of you unpolished,\" lest an eligible colleague who glances your way fails to keep glancing. Dating, born in cities, grew up on the college campus. In the twenties and thirties, privileged College Men and Coeds pursued one another with a libidinous vigor to rival latter-day \"hook-up culture.\" Students got physical both at official mixers and at gatherings of their own\u2014\" Mothers Complain That Modern Girls \u2018Vamp\u2019 Their Sons at Petting Parties ,\" reads a 1922 Times headline dug up by Weigel. They escaped adult scrutiny via that supreme agent of American sexual freedom, the automobile. They danced dirty. And they drank\u2014a lot. \"Hold me up, kid; I\u2019m ginned,\" a girl at a social slurs to a fraternity brother in the 1924 campus novel \"The Plastic Age.\" Looking around for backup, he sees that just about everyone else is either crying or vomiting in the bushes. The point of all this canoodling wasn\u2019t to get married. No woman expected to traipse down the aisle with her dance partner from last Saturday night, regardless of what they had done in the dark. The point, Weigel notes, was to compete. Students \"rated\" one another\u2019s social credit; the better you rated, the more you dated, and the more you dated, the higher you rated. None other than the anthropologist Margaret Mead characterized college dating as \"a competitive game\" rather than a proper courtship ritual. Students weren\u2019t playing for emotional keeps. The stakes were the admiration and envy of one\u2019s peers. This state of affairs changed during and after the Second World War, at least in part as a matter of wartime necessity. With so many men away, Weigel explains, girls had to hang on to the boys they could get. During the years of postwar abundance, dating became a crucial feature of the American consumer economy, something that teens of the rapidly expanding middle class, newly awash in disposable income and unencumbered by dark memories of the Depression, could spend their dollars on. Everybody was doing it, and so, for once, romantic supply equalled demand: people paired off. You\u2019d think that adults would have cheered their offsprings\u2019 coupling tendencies. \"One boy to laugh with, to joke with, have Coke with,\" sings Kim MacAfee, the fifteen-year-old heroine of \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" expressing the fantasies of her generation: \"One boy, not two or three.\" Having a Coke with a single beau seems a lot more wholesome than attending a petting party with a bunch of them. But grownups didn\u2019t cheer. Advice columns lamented the \"ridiculous custom\" of teen-age couples \"pairing off to the exclusion of everyone else on the dance floor.\" The Baltimore Afro-American, one of the country\u2019s biggest black-owned papers, told its younger readers that trying out multiple romantic partners was healthier, in the long run, than \"settling down\" too fast. Young people were encouraged, in fittingly consumerist terms, to \"shop around,\" so that they wouldn\u2019t find themselves saddled with a lacklustre steady for life. Playing at marriage, they were told, would leave them with all the institution\u2019s ills and none of its benefits. This was objectively true in one respect at least: teen-pregnancy rates soared, both in and out of wedlock. Trying to stay one step ahead, Catholic schools across the country started expelling students found to be in monogamous relationships. On the plus side, Weigel argues, the culture of going steady allowed couples a degree of emotional intimacy that earlier dating models lacked. But its restrictive mores also put the onus on girls to regulate both their own sexual urges and those of their boyfriends. The result \"was a setup that subjected girls to constant stress, self-blame, and regret.\" Weigel describes an illustrative scene from a forties teen novel in which a group of boys\u2014\"The Checkers,\" they\u2019re ominously called\u2014hang out in front of a favorite date spot in their Wisconsin town in order to report, the narrator says, \"any violations on the part of the girls who are supposed to be going steady.\" The history of dating, then, is also the history of the surveillance of daters. As young people figured out how to conduct their private lives away from the supervision of parents, teachers, and chaperones, they took it upon themselves to do the supervising, creating and enforcing their own codes of behavior. They proved to be remarkably adept at it. No one, it turned out, regulates the sexual and romantic lives of young people as effectively as young people themselves. That\u2019s one conclusion to draw from \"American Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers\" (Knopf), by the Vanity Fair reporter Nancy Jo Sales. Even if you\u2019ve been following teen social-media horror stories\u2014the recent case of an Ohio girl live-streaming her friend\u2019s rape comes to mind\u2014Sales\u2019s book makes for an urgent, dispiriting portrait. Teen-age girls are the largest group of social-media users in the country. \"For the first time,\" Sales writes, \"most American girls are engaged in the same activity most of the time.\" Curious to see what effects such constant digital engagement were having on teen-age girls, she interviewed a diverse group of more than two hundred of them. Sales learned that girls are being bombarded on their phones with images, videos, comments, and the like that \"are offensive and potentially damaging to their well-being and sense of self-esteem.\" She writes about an American Psychological Association report published in 2007, just before the iPhone launched, which found that girls were \"treated as \u2018objects of sexual desire . . . as things rather than as people with legitimate sexual feelings of their own\u2019\u2014in virtually every form of media, including movies, television, music videos and lyrics, video games and the Internet, advertising, cartoons, clothing, and toys.\" The report saw links between such sexualization and mental-health problems, including anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Sales argues that sexualization has become \"a prevailing mode, influencing how girls see themselves, as well as how they present themselves.\" Sales begins her book with the story of Sophia, a thirteen-year-old in Montclair, New Jersey, who receives a text one day after school from Zack, a boy in her eighth-grade class: \" SEND NOODZ .\" (Sales has changed her subjects\u2019 names.) Girls are often solicited for naked pictures, and, as Sophia knows, it isn\u2019t uncommon for the photos to be compiled and shared on virtual \"slut pages.\" Still, it hasn\u2019t happened to her before: \" \u2018I was like, Whoa, he finds me attractive?\u2019 \" Sophia hasn\u2019t yet had her first kiss; she wonders if it might be with Zack. Actually, Zack confesses, he just needs the photo so that he can trade it to a high-school senior in exchange for booze. \"Lol,\" Sophia responds. There\u2019s a consensus among her friends that humor is the de-rigueur response, a way to demonstrate \"chill\"\u2014detachment, a feigned attitude of control in situations designed to wrest it from them. One way to get back at the boys is by posting selfies, a declaration, at least in theory, that girls have the right to present themselves however they want. Sophia has an Instagram account full of selfies, all capturing the same pose\u2014\"bite-tongue smile\"\u2014which she laughingly calls \"my brand.\" (It\u2019s a knockoff; here, as throughout the book, Sales spies the long shadow cast by the likes of Miley Cyrus and the Kardashians.) She and her friends use apps to edit their pictures, and, like a pop star dropping an album, post them when they think most people will see them. Sometimes, Sophia tells Sales, it takes up to seventy tries to get the shot right. Then she monitors the comments and the likes as they come in. \"I feel like I\u2019m brainwashed into wanting likes,\" Sophia says. Weigel would point out that girls like Sophia are expending an enormous amount of labor to compete in the online sexual marketplace run by their peers. And boys are hardly the only ones who dictate the terms. \"It\u2019s like you spend half your time managing your reputation,\" another one of Sales\u2019s subjects says, referring to the effort it takes to keep up the requisite stream of flattering commentary on other girls\u2019 Instagram selfies. Sierra, a fifteen-year-old from Jamestown, Virginia, who is frequently cyberbullied, monitors her Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Ask.fm accounts as she speaks with Sales, deleting negative comments the moment they appear. It\u2019s \"a lot of work,\" serving as her own censor, Sierra admits. Another girl tells Sales that social media is \"destroying our lives.\" Sales asks why she doesn\u2019t quit. \"Because then we would have no life,\" she is told. Like many adults trying to understand a younger generation\u2019s approach to sex and romance, Sales\u2014who has a teen-age daughter herself\u2014is curious to hear girls\u2019 thoughts on dating. \"Dating is just for other people to know that you\u2019re dating,\" Sophia says. \"People post about it all the time. Like kissing photos.\" This seems to be the consensus across \"American Girls.\" It sounds familiar. \"Men were only the gloves with which one slapped the face of girls,\" says a character from a nineteen-twenties short story about college which Weigel quotes. \"It was women one dueled.\" When it comes to teen-agers and college students, the notion of \"dating\" is often presented in opposition to casual sex, as if one precluded the other. But Sales isn\u2019t anti-sex. She\u2019s pro-intimacy, in favor of girls seeking out the kind of unscripted, unmonitored contact that might allow them to put themselves forward without risking calamitous social censure. As in the first days of dating, Sales suggests that privacy might be best found in public. She closes her book with Eve, a nineteen-year-old college student in Newark, Delaware, who has gone on one date: \"The boy had borrowed his friend\u2019s car, picked her up, and driven her to Main Street, \u2018and we went out to dinner, and it was just so refreshing. Awkward as hell because I\u2019d never done it before, but it was a real-life thrill. I was like, Holy shit, how do I look? Like I couldn\u2019t plan on what I was going to say to him . . . it\u2019s not like texting. . . . Like you\u2019re here, this is live, this is now. I need that.\u2019 \" Reading Weigel\u2019s \"Labor of Love,\" you can get the sense that women are now pinballing among the worst of all the dating systems that have come before. Like the shopgirls of the twenties, Weigel says, we turn ourselves into commodities, typing up dating-site profiles as if they were product descriptions, placing orders on one person and disposing of the next with a single swipe. We drift into reluctant long-term commitments, as the monogamists of the fifties did. Young women are still warned, as the career women of the eighties were, that we\u2019re \"dating on a deadline\" and have only so much time before our eggs dry up\u2014if we haven\u2019t frozen them, in which case we must not let prospective partners in on the secret, lest they fear entrapment in the plans we\u2019ve worked out for the future. It\u2019s enough to cause an identity crisis, which is exactly what Weigel says happened to her. \"I had no idea who I was,\" she writes in the book\u2019s afterword. \"And as long as I kept impersonating all the women I thought I should be, I could not receive love, much less give it. I had no self to choose to give it from.\" Weigel is hardly alone in making this sad confession. \"Do we even know what being in love is?\" Eve asks Sales in \"American Girls.\" \"Will we ever get there because we have such a screwed-up notion of what it should be, or how you should get there?\" But dating can be more than a tool by which society bends us to fit its romantic design. It\u2019s also a way of discovering the self, of testing out different lives and different loves. Inevitably, some of those lives crack and dissolve. The self changes, as the self is liable to do. It can be painful, this sloughing off of earlier selves, this reconsidering of earlier desires. It can be necessary, too. In \"All the Single Ladies,\" Traister celebrates the fact that the average age at which American women first get married is now, at twenty-seven, the highest it\u2019s ever been. Women are taking more time to define the terms of their own lives, single or joined. Traister got married when she was thirty-five, to a man who was a decade older. At that age, she writes, \"one of us was not simply going to subsume the other.\" In other words, they had selves, ones they wanted to keep and share. The best part of hitting the dating jackpot on the first go-round also sometimes turns out to be the worst: you might get just what you thought you wanted. At the end of \"Labor of Love,\" Weigel reveals that she married her husband while writing her book. Yet she says nothing about their courtship. After all her talk about love as labor, and the careful attention she pays to the transactional vocabulary of dating, Weigel describes the circumstances of her own union with the ultimate phrase of romantic effortlessness: she fell in love. Maybe she really did get the job done that easily. You know what they say, though, about how marriage takes hard work. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for the sequel. \u2666", "He says a solo trip here is intimidating and thrilling.

They found that the majority of the participants, who were from Brazil, Cameroon, the Czech Republic and Namibia, preferred medium sized breasts, followed by large sized breasts. And the firmer, the better. But the research paper states: However, a substantial portion of the participants selected either large or small size as their most preferred, indicating considerable inter- individual variation in breast size preferences.

As protests over the fatal police shootings of black men raged in Charlotte and elsewhere last week, students at the University of Vermont hoisted a Black Lives Matter flag at the center of campus, right next to, and at the same height, as the state flag and the American flag. The university and the Student Government Association sanctioned the display, saying it was designed to show support for those \"struggling with the violence and search for justice in this country.\" Sophomore Akilah Ho-Young could hardly contain her excitement. \"I wanted to cry when I saw this,\" Ho-Young said in a Sept. 22 Facebook post that included a picture of the Black Lives Matter flag flying outside the student center, alongside the American and state flags. \"My body filled with lots of joy to know that my predominantly white university is paying tribute to the deaths in the black community,\" she said. \"It\u2019s the littlest thing that just means so much to me!\" The post went viral.

The episode underscored the extent to which a movement and a symbol have come to stand for radically different things to different people. And it illustrates how the debate over race relations and policing in America has penetrated the land, after a summer punctuated by several high-profile officer-involved shootings of black men, the assassination of six police officers by a black gunman in Dallas, and the mass demonstrations that have followed in cities around the country. The phrase Black Lives Matter first received national attention in summer 2014 and, since then, has become part of conversations on race in America. Here's how the phrase became a movement. (Claritza Jimenez,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) [Black Dallas police officer sues Black Lives Matter on behalf of \u2018Christians, Jews and Caucasians,\u2019 others] The flag controversy in Vermont played out against a backdrop of protests, some of them violent, over the fatal police shootings of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte and Terence Crutcher in Tulsa. When news about the flag spread, some critics immediately cited the demonstrations in Charlotte \u2014 where a civilian reportedly shot and killed a protester and some demonstrators destroyed property \u2014 as evidence that Black Lives Matter promoted violence and was itself a racist movement, although no connection between that shooting and the BLM movement has been alleged. \"This is why I\u2019m ashamed to have gone to this school.

This appears to be oppressive to students with other viewpoints.\" The flagpole at the student center has historically flown flags that represent different groups on campus and allows university organizations to sponsor similar displays, university officials told NBC 5. Helen Driesen, a 19-year-old political science major at the university, said she was coming home from a party early Sunday morning when she noticed the bare pole in front of the student center. She said she\u2019d seen posts on social media from people in town, but not necessarily students, calling for the flag to be taken down. \"I was angry but I\u2019m honestly not surprised,\" Driesen told The Washington Post. \"People have all kinds of misconceptions about this movement. They don\u2019t understand the gravity of it and how extremely overdue it is.\" Student Government Association President Jason Maulucci said he never expected such an intense backlash. In an interview with The Post, Maulucci said university administrators had approved the proposal to raise the Black Lives Matter flag without issue. At first, Maulucci said, the response was \"overwhelmingly positive.\" But as the display gained national attention, Maulucci said he started getting hate mail and threats from strangers online. Then, at some point late Saturday or early Sunday, someone took the flag down. A picture of the crank on the flagpole suggested someone had pried it open, lowered the flag and stolen it, Maulucci said. \"When the #BlackLivesMatter flag was stolen last night, #UVM Student Life Director and his wife painted a new one and replaced it.\" pic.twitter.com/lqJGrAHO98 \u2014 Chris Campbell (@ChrisCampbel_) September 25, 2016 By Sunday afternoon, however, a new flag had been hoisted in its place, sewn together by Pat Brown, the university\u2019s director of student life, according to Maulucci. \"It was upsetting that someone stole it, but I think it underscored the necessity for raising in the first place,\" Maulucci said. \"We\u2019re proud of the fact that we\u2019re contributing to that conversation. You can\u2019t make progress unless you acknowledge that there\u2019s a problem.\" It was not the first, and will not be the last, conflict of its kind. [This attorney wore a Black Lives Matter pin to court \u2014 and went to jail for it] In July, a police officer in Detroit was demoted for a post critical of Black Lives Matter. The same month, an Ohio judge ordered an attorney jailed for five hours for wearing a Black Lives Matter pin to court. And in May, a controversy erupted at Dartmouth University after a group of students removed a \"Blue Lives Matter\" display and replaced it with Black Lives Matter posters. In May, conservative commentators joined a chorus of critics demanding a hate group designation for Black Lives Matter from the Southern Poverty Law Center, claiming that in the wake of the shootings of police officers in Dallas, its rhetoric was inflammatory. The SPLC, which tracks hate groups, refused, explaining itself in a long post by SPLC president Richard Cohen: There\u2019s no doubt that some protesters who claim the mantle of Black Lives Matter have said offensive things, like the chant \u2018pigs in a blanket, fry \u2019em like bacon\u2019 that was heard at one rally. But before we condemn the entire movement for the words of a few, we should ask ourselves whether we would also condemn the entire Republican Party for the racist words of its presumptive nominee \u2014 or for the racist rhetoric of many other politicians in the party over the course of years. Student activists are set to host a rally Monday at 4:30 outside the student center, where they plan to dress entirely in black and gather for a picture around the new flag, according to a Facebook event. The event had more than 500 guests as of Monday morning. Organizers \u2014 among them Ho-Young, whose Facebook post went viral \u2014 stressed that the event was not a protest but a peaceful demonstration to \"celebrate the black community and their alliances.\" \"The flags being placed on the same level represents what this nation and institution was built on,\" the event\u2019s organizers said. \"Equality for all people.\"", "It's amazing to think that just 10 years ago, flat-rate digital music streaming services were a mere gleam in the eye of industry executives. It was as recently as September 2007 that Rick Rubin, then co-head of Columbia Records, put forward the idea as a way of combating online music piracy and file-sharing. \"You'd pay, say, $19.95 a month, and the music will come from anywhere you'd like,\" he told the New York Times. \"In this new world, there will be a virtual library that will be accessible from your car, from your cell phone, from your computer, from your television.\" As it turned out, he was essentially describing Spotify, which launched just over a year later. He even got the price right. In those heady days, when the pound was a lot stronger, $19.95 was equivalent to \u00a310, which, give or take a penny, is the monthly cost of Spotify Premium in the UK today. But Spotify is yet to make a profit, while plans to float the firm on the stock market have reportedly been delayed, raising a big question mark over its business model. Industry accolade Of course, Spotify isn't the only streaming platform out there. Others have joined it over the past decade, including Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music and Deezer, as well as high-resolution music services Tidal and Qobuz. But Spotify is seen as the leader, with more than 100 million users, 40 million of them paid-up subscribers to its Premium tier. The Swedish firm is now a major player in 60 countries, including the world's biggest music market, the US, where streaming accounted for 51% of music consumption last year. Reflecting the huge impact that Spotify has had, its chief executive, Daniel Ek, has just topped US music industry magazine Billboard's latest Power 100 list of the biggest movers and shakers in the business. \"For the first time since [former file-sharing service] Napster decimated music sales, the recorded music industry is showing signs of growth, and that reversal of fortune is largely due to one man,\" Billboard said in its citation. The magazine also hailed Spotify as \"the place fans discover music as well as consume it\", pointing to its promoted playlists, including its Discover Weekly service. Royalty woes However, the clock is ticking for Spotify as it hatches its plans to go public. The firm originally planned to float this year, but according to the TechCrunch website, this could now be delayed until 2018. There are various issues behind this move, not least of which is that Spotify needs to conclude new long-term licensing deals with the big three record companies - Universal, Sony and Warner - to avoid the risk of suddenly losing major chunks of its content. It's thought that Spotify currently pays 55% of its revenue to record labels in royalties, with additional money going to music publishers. In the interest of finally becoming a profitable company, it would like to lower that percentage, but this is unlikely to go down well with artists, who argue that the royalties they receive from streaming are unfairly low as it is. Brutal arithmetic But if it waits too long before floating, it could face a serious cash crisis. In March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once the initial public offering (IPO) of shares takes place. However, under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the IPO happens. So as time goes on, Spotify must pay ever larger sums to its creditors just to settle the interest on its loan, while the amount of money it can raise from its IPO is trimmed by an ever greater amount. Unless Mr Ek can get the better of this brutal arithmetic, the future looks tough for Spotify. But at the same time, as Billboard says, \"the entire music business now has an interest in its success\". \"If it's not already too big to fail, it's headed in that direction quickly,\" concludes the magazine.", "Here\u2019s What Happens When You Give $1,000 to Someone in Extreme Poverty Margaret Osuma Oshien from Siaya, Kenya \u2014 A person who received just under $1,000 cash unconditionally from GiveDirectly.org My wife, Adrienne, and I are long-time supporters of unconditional cash giving. From handing $5 to a homeless person on the street in Manhattan to raising $450 to give to a working father of one in rural South Africa \u2014 we believe in the virtues of sharing abundance in an empowering fashion that enables people to decide how best to allocate their resources themselves. When we found GiveDirectly in November 2015, an org that gives $1,000, unconditionally, to people who are in extreme poverty, as a solution to get them out of extreme poverty, we fell in love. Unconditional \u2014 they can do anything they want with it \u2014 which is incredibly empowering to recipients, but many people in \u2018the west\u2019 think it\u2019s risky...or even foolish. We\u2019ve told countless friends and family about GiveDirectly, and the concept of transferring cash is met with much skepticism; soliciting responses such as \"eh, I only give people food,\" and others such as; \"How do they make sure people aren\u2019t defrauding them or stealing the cash?\" \"I bet most people waste or squander the cash.\" \"It probably doesn\u2019t have long-term impact, such as building a school could.\" \"General angst about the \"Savior Barbie\" complex, where western people go out to save people in poor countries by telling them what they should do \u2014 often a self-serving endeavor.\" ...and more. After dealing with the frequent barrage of opposing views, but always holding strong to our personal convictions; we decided to dig for some more answers \u2014 and see how many of these holes they were poking in our own justifications could be filled. Since we currently travel abroad full-time, and Kenya is an incredible country, we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under the hood of GD\u2019s operation. Outside of GiveDirectly\u2019s Country Headquarters in Kisumu, Kenya In August 2016, my wife and I visited GiveDirectly\u2019s office in Kisumu, Kenya and spent two 10-hour days in the field, visiting real past recipients in the Siaya (where President Obama\u2019s grandmother lives!) and Homa Bay regions. After meeting the team on the ground and hearing about their day to day work, we were really surprised and impressed by five main things that actually directly addressed a lot of the negative feedback we\u2019ve heard in the past: ) The vast majority of the team are local Kenyans; only two of around 80 or so employees are expats. We think that\u2019s fantastic, since we\u2019ve already known that 91% of the cash that we personally give to GD goes directly into the field, but actually a solid portion of the 9% administrative cost actually funnels into creating local jobs that afford hundreds more people in East Africa the opportunity to build bright futures for themselves. There\u2019s a huge unemployment issue in Kenya and other East African countries and foreign investment is still far behind demand, so this kind of job creation has a huge impact on the community. Beyond the employment opportunity, the real incredible moments for us came when we had the chance to speak individually with a few of the locals on the team. Candidly; they are all proud to be working their asses off to improve the lives of people in their own community. We even heard two separate stories from some senior-level guys (still under 30 years old) who were driven to work at GiveDirectly after having their own first real exposure to abject poverty; even just a few miles from where they lived. They were moved to make a difference, to pour their energy every day into giving other people in their community better lives. Cavin Oginga (from Kenya) \u2014 A Field Ops Manager for GiveDirectly \u2014 who applied for a job there after running a research project on GiveDirectly\u2019s work (for poverty-action.org) and seeing what a massive impact they were having. One of the most interesting stories we heard was about a young woman who received a cash transfer from GiveDirectly in 2014. She used a large portion of the transfer to cover her school fees so that she could complete her schooling, and then graduated and immediately sought employment. She applied to work for GiveDirectly (GD often has 200\u2013600 applicants for any one vacancy) and she got the job. From living off of less than one dollar a day, to now being employed in one of the most competitive roles available, the cash transfer from GiveDirectly has completely altered the path of her life, and she will reach heights that only two years ago she would have thought to be completely unattainable for her. 2.) There was really no \"savior barbie\" complex in the GiveDirectly operation \u2014 no one is coming in from wealthy nations and telling anyone else how to live their own lives and what\u2019s best for them, and no one here is swooping in from some rich country on a self-serving mission \u2018save the world.\u2019 3.) Auditing \u2014 The rigor behind this operation is crazy. They have 5 separate teams of people for each stage in the transfer process \u2014 from initial outreach through final follow-up, the recipients almost never see the same people, so there\u2019s no nepotism, and absolutely everything is audited. 4.) Let\u2019s face it \u2014 \u2018data\u2019 is boring and unsexy, yet it\u2019s likely the most powerful foundation for any for-profit or charitable organization to build upon. GiveDirectly is almost annoying with how data-centric they are. Every decision, literally every single question we asked them about why they do or do not do something, was backed by data. And we\u2019re not talking about just any old data. We\u2019re talking about peer-reviewed, audited, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) \u2014 the holy grail of \"I\u2019m right and you\u2019re wrong.\" Not that they carry that swagger on their shoulder whatsoever (I\u2019m humble-bragging on their behalf), but if they\u2019re doing something, it\u2019s because their data, and 3 other independent sources\u2019 data has proven that\u2019s the right decision. 5.) The \u2018mission\u2019 per se of how GD gives isn\u2019t about funding what they believe will have the most \u2018profitable\u2019 result, rather, funding is based on who has the greatest need. Basically it\u2019s the ultimate \"anti\" ruthless capitalism. I loved hearing that. (i.e. not favoring a 22 year old with a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas over a 35 y/o single mother of 4) Richard Aura Ongari from Homa Bay, Kenya sits inside of the small two-room mud hut that he build with part of his cash transfer from GiveDirectly. The majority of his transfer has been spent on medication for a chronic illness. Before being able to afford the medication, Richard could not walk, but now that he\u2019s being treated, you can find him marching all around his property and enjoying his life with his children and grandchildren. Now, for the meat of it \u2014 we went into small Kenyan villages and met these people who\u2019ve taken a cash transfer of $1,000 (3 installments over a year). Here\u2019s the breakdown of how their money was spent: 1.) Housing \u2014 everyone that we met improved their housing situation in some way; they were fixing the following core issues; (and FYI we didn\u2019t see a single home that was larger than 20 feet by 20 feet (That size home would house 5\u20139 people)) This small mud shack is home to 5. Before receiving his $1,000 transfer from GiveDirectly, Samwel Odhimbo Orimba and his family lived homeless on the shores of Lake Victoria in Homa Bay, Kenya. This house, where you can see through the walls, is a major upgrade for this incredibly grateful and loving family. a. Thatched roof \u2014 which leaks in every rain and must be replaced every 1\u20133 years. i. Completely sleepless nights (who can sleep getting rained on?) ii. Leads to frequent illness / sometimes chronic, and death iii. Leads to missed frequently school for children iv. Leads to missed work and income b. No home \u2014 living with 4\u20138 people in a 10x12 one or two room mud hut c. Upgrading home \u2014 living in a mud hut (with holes in the walls) d. Dirt floor in home \u2014 constant insect infestation, including \"jigas\" which burrow in your feet causing crippling pain. 2.) School Fees \u2014 After primary school, Kenyans have to pay $60-$70 per 3-month semester for school, given that people in extreme poverty often earn less than $5 a day for a family of 2\u20134 kids, that meager amount can be a mountain, forcing thousands of kids to miss out on school from 5 or 6 years old and onwards. 3 children of GiveDirectly Recipient Eunice Awino Omondi, and 5 of their friends all living in Siaya Kenya (Where President Obama\u2019s Grandmother lives!). Eunice\u2019s children are now much healthier because they can sleep through the night under a steel roof, and not thatched grass that keeps them up and cold when it rains. 3.) Food \u2014 probably the saddest of expenditures, in my opinion, but a lot of people that we met were purchasing a few month\u2019s worth of corn to feed their families. I see it as the saddest because such a basic need, that\u2019s consumed and gone without perpetual benefits Bags of corn purchased with a portion of a cash transfer from GiveDirectly that sit in the recipients doorway / living room / foyer / children's\u2019 bedroom / guest\u2019s bedroom 4.) Other \u2014 Outside of those top three, which everyone seemed to have spent at least some portion of their transfer on, people purchased medicines for chronic illness (Cancer, HIV, etc), livestock for income, and clothing & shoes. 5.) I\u2019ll hide this little gem in here: Many skeptics think that large portions of the transfers will be wasted on vices like alcohol, drugs, or tobacco, or that the sudden influx of cash may increase a person\u2019s propensity to seek these substances, however there is no evidence that vice consumption is different from others in the community who did not receive transfers. With GD\u2019s rigorous measurement and auditing, they find the effect on vice spending (tobacco, alcohol, etc.), is \"negative and insignificant,\" meaning there is no statistically significant effect on vice consumption...Here is the 3rd party study conducted by Princeton.edu This finding is consistent with a publication from World Bank on vice spending and cash transfers that surveyed dozens of studies from around the world. Now this ended up being a pretty diverse array of purchases considering that half were from one little village, and half from another, and for us it just highlights the variety of need that exists within any small community. I think that if an organization went in to build clean water wells, offered solar panels, mosquito nets, donate clothes, built schools or built houses \u2014 only a fraction of the gross value of the investment would be felt by the people in the community. Shoving a square peg of charity into a round hole of need. This is exactly why we believe in giving cash, and why we believe in GiveDirectly. Of course these people still have needs for more, but I can confidently say that 91% of what we give them goes directly to people who need it most, and 97% of that cash transfer served immediate needs in their lives, and I don\u2019t think other NGOs can say the same. I think a more open and participatory conversation on eradicating extreme poverty is critical in this day and age. Extreme poverty sits at the bottom of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs and contributes to massive issues all the way up the pyramid; leading to widespread health epidemics, overpopulation, lack of education, lack of environmental and conservational awareness, increased violence and pollution. We\u2019re all connected, and the more people who live in dignity, the better off we can all be. Do you think cash transfers are a terrible idea? Do you know of a better way?", "THE body of teen Paige Johnson has been found in Ohio almost 10 YEARS after she mysteriously vanished in Kentucky.

Now, 25 years later, \"Murphy Brown\" is returning to TV in a new syndication deal on Encore Classic. The new channel replaces Encore Love as part of a new strategy to focus on viewer subsets that use the pay channel. Encore Classic is aimed at the Baby Boomer demographic with reruns of \"Murphy Brown,\" \"Night Court\" and \"Magnum, P.I.\" along with films such as \"Tootsie,\" Kramer vs. Kramer\" and \"Good Will Hunting.\" Bergen told Zap2It she's excited the show is coming back to TV airwaves. \"I have no idea why it's taken so long. I was always told it was because the music rights were so expensive, because every episode opened with a Motown song. I'm thrilled it's going back on -- and without commercials, which is lovely.

The settlement, which is expected to be for at least $700 million, would resolve several civil probes into the multibillion-dollar trading losses at the largest U.S. bank last year. Regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, are expected to be part of the settlement. The New York Times reported that the fines would top $900 million. The FCA and SEC declined to comment. However, U.S. prosecutors are still investigating JPMorgan for potential criminal wrongdoing.

But feeding your friend\u2019s adopted baby after the loss of your own infant is more than gracious \u2014 it\u2019s entirely selfless. This story of a grieving mom deciding to donate breast milk to her friend is so deeply moving, and something not every mom would have the strength to do. Today contributor Lauren Casper told the heartbreaking and incredibly touching story of friend Sarah Rieke\u2019s decision to donate her breast milk to Casper\u2019s adopted daughter Arsema. The friends were expecting their children together, with Casper awaiting adoption of a baby girl from Ethiopia and Rieke 20 weeks pregnant. The day of the \"big\" ultrasound, the friends excitedly anticipated news of the little one\u2019s sex. Casper writes, \"I was secretly hoping for the news to come back that she was having a girl. I was dreaming about our daughters being great friends, just like their big brothers are. The text came... girl... but there were complications.\" As it turned out, those complications weren\u2019t compatible with life and as Casper says, \"I prepared my nursery for the homecoming of my daughter and Rieke planned a funeral.\" Yet, her friend was still supportive, even in this time of unimaginable grief. She writes, \"We spent a lot of mornings together crying and talking and even laughing at times. She threw me a baby shower and gave me two blankets out of a packet of four... the other two would be wrapped around her daughter after she was born.\" Shortly after Arsema was brought home from Ethiopia, her friend approached her with a heartfelt offer. Rieke said, \"I was wondering if you would like to have my breast milk after Evie is born. I thought maybe you could use it to feed Arsema. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll pump or how much I\u2019ll be able to produce, but I\u2019d love to give it to you if you want it.\" Rieke\u2019s daughter, named Evie Caris, was born the month after Arsema came home and lived for just four hours. Only a week after her baby passed, the grieving mom made good on her offer and started bringing milk to her friend\u2019s baby every week. Of the selfless act, Casper wrote, \"Each time I filled Arsema\u2019s bottle and sat in the rocker to feed her I would think about Sarah and Evie. I would pray for Sarah\u2019s broken heart and thank God for the gift Sarah had so selflessly given me and my daughter.\" She further explains that her friend wanted to do something \"meaningful\" and it seemed pumping for Arsema was healing for her in a way, as she grieved the loss of her own baby girl. In giving Arsema her milk, she provided a gift Casper couldn\u2019t give her children. \"She knew one of the painful losses of infertility and adoption was my inability to breastfeed my children. They each had such a rough start in life and I wish I could have been able to at least give them that.\" To some, it might be hard to understand how a mom could have pumped milk for another baby only days after losing her own, but if you\u2019re a parent, her probably reasons come into focus rather quickly. She likely wanted a connection to her child and to feel she had some impact on the world, no matter how small. By pumping the milk that was meant for her daughter and allowing it to nourish another baby, it kept Evie\u2019s memory alive in some way. And gave a beautiful gift to a friend, establishing a bond they\u2019ll have for the rest of their lives. Of Rieke\u2019s selfless act, Casper writes, \"I wish I could have breastfed my children. Sarah wishes she could have fed her daughter (and so do I... oh so do I). But life doesn\u2019t always make sense. When everything is broken and mixed up, we have to create our own beauty from the pieces.\" And that\u2019s exactly what these friends did.", "The honeymoon is the light at the end of the tunnel for many brides and grooms-to-be who have had it up to here with wedding planning. But unfortunately, the much-awaited trip doesn't always turn out as planned. In a HuffPost Live segment that aired Tuesday, Alejandra Rudner told host Caitlyn Becker about the disastrous events that plagued her European honeymoon. At a stop in Mykonos during their cruise through the Greek Isles, Rudner and her husband rented ATVs. After hitting a speed bump and falling off of the vehicle, her husband shattered his shoulder and Rudner rotated her hip, cutting the trip short. \"At least I get my checkmark for 'in sickness and in health' and 'for better or for worse,'\" she said.", "\u2018No Man's Sky\u2019 might get an Xbox One version (Photo : Christian Petersen/Getty Images) While, game developer Hello Games's much talked about fiction action adventure survival video game \"No Man's Sky,\" has been rolled out for PlayStation 4, PC and Steam, there's currently no word on when the game will get a Microsoft Xbox One release date. According to the Independent, a \"No Man's Sky\" player was able to break into the game's code which mentioned something about the Xbox One. Neogaf user Hugo Peters reportedly found code within the \"No Man's Sky\" PC version software that licenses the Havok physics engine and allows it to be used on the Xbox One. However, it doesn't mean that No Man's Sky Xbox One release is happening anytime soon. During an interview with the Daily Star, when Hello Games' Sean Murray was asked if \"No Man's Sky\" will make it to the Xbox One, he said he didn't know what exactly he was allowed to disclose about \"No Man's Sky\" or the possibility of a Xbox One version of the game. Murray mentioned the fact that he needed to be \"very specific with [his] words.\" It is to be noted that he did not completely reject chances of rolling out an Xbox One version of No Man's Sky. The new space game has a gigantic universe with almost over 18 quintillion - or approx. 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 -planets, each unique and different in its own way. This means that it will take more than 500 billion years for a gamer to visit each planet for one second. In fact, if you are the first person to discover a planet, then your name will be forever etched in \"No Man's Sky\" history, reported GameSpot. It currently seems unlikely that an Xbox One version of \"No Man's Sky\" will be released, but there's always scope for change. Stay tuned to SWR for more updates on \"No Man's Sky\" Xbox One release date.", "The term \"colored\" has not been widely used to address African-Americans for some time due to the heavy racial undertones that come with it. According to the AJC , a Good Morning America host didn't seem to get that memo as she used the term when referencing Black actors in Hollywood during a segment. \"Now, we all know Hollywood has received recent and quite a bit of criticism for casting white actors in what one might assume should be a role reserved for colored people,\" host Amy Robach, an alum of the University of Georgia, said. Robach was specifically addressing the casting of Zendaya in the role of Mary Jane in the upcoming Spiderman film \u2014 a role that was repeatedly played by white actresses in the past. After viewers of the segment lashed out at the journalist for her offensive and insensitive remark, she released a statement, apologizing for her \"mistake.\" \"This morning, during a segment about Hollywood casting, I mistakenly said 'colored people' instead of 'people of color,\"\" she said. \"I sincerely apologize. It was a mistake and is not at all a reflection of how I feel or speak in my everyday life.\"", "Your tires are the most important part of your car. They can make you faster, they can save your life, or they can get you killed, even if you\u2019re the star of a major car-centric action franchise, and even if you aren\u2019t driving. (Spoiler alert: the driver dies too). Considering how important tires are, they aren\u2019t given nearly enough credit in the media or in car-guy circles. Sure, every racer talks about tires, and a lot of canyon warriors will sit on top of the snake talking setup, but on the internet and in casual conversation with casual enthusiasts, tires are a dull topic. You certainly can\u2019t brag about them on a forum the way you can with your upgraded turbo and fresh dyno chart. You have to go into the Grassroots Motorsports catalog, or to a very specific sub-genre to see a tire comparison test for your desired application, so most people just end up reading reviews on TireRack. Tires are a dull topic even when we\u2019re actively shopping for tires. They have insanely complicated naming schemes like GoodRubber GoodGripper Pro XGV25, which makes them even harder to discuss than Infiniti\u2019s current lineup. In all seriousness, I have a set of tires on my Mustang at the moment called \"Continental ContiForce Contact.\" That\u2019s a real name under which a real set of tires is marketed. Most people don\u2019t have the luxury of actually testing tires before they buy either, making decisions based on either anecdotal evidence, a roll of the dice, budget, or a combination of the three. Nevertheless, the four small patches of rubber connecting your two-ton manslaughter machine to your city\u2019s lowest-priced asphalt are, if you ask me, the best way to improve your car, or, the quickest way to fuck it up, crash, and even die. Even if you should know better. And I\u2019m going to give you one piece of advice\u2014advice I learned the hard way, but not as hard as my friends Paul Walker\u2014who would have celebrated his 43rd birthday this week\u2014and Roger Rodas did. In November of 2012, I entered my modified C5 Corvette in the \"Optima Batteries Ultimate Street Car Invitational,\" a multi-discipline driving event held the day after SEMA ends in Las Vegas. [Disclaimer: I have done promotional work at events for Optima Batteries unrelated to this event or to my column at The Drive.] I could not have been less prepared for this event if I had left the car\u2019s targa roof at home in the garage, which, by the way, I did. Think it never rains in Vegas? Never snows? Go there in a car without a roof. I guarantee both will happen. Though the car was, and is, in mostly good nick, with, at the time, around 25,000 miles on it. The engine makes 400 horsepower to the wheels with some mild bolt-on upgrades, and it has a Stoptech Big Brake kit, Pfadt coilover suspension, racing seats, harnesses, and more. All of it worked. The bad news? It also had six-year old Goodyear F1 Assymetric tires on it. They had less than 5,000 miles on them, so they looked nearly new. But looking new and gripping like new are two different propositions entirely. A tire, for those as unfamiliar with this concept as I was back then, does two things: it sticks to the road by nature of its rubber chemical compound, and it disperses water using the tread pattern cut into the tire. On a street tire, most people will notice their tread has worn down after several thousand miles of use and decide it\u2019s time to get new tires. If it rains, the worn tread won\u2019t disperse water as well and you will have poor wet-weather performance, and a tendency towards hydroplaning. With cars driven frequently, you will wear out your tread before you age-out your rubber, which is the problem I want to address. With collector cars, especially cars driven less than a few thousand miles a year, the problem is that while your tread may look good, the rubber is old and dry, and simply will not work properly. The chemical compounds in your tires will degrade over time, significantly reducing your available grip, or worse, blowing out a sidewall under load. With sport tires, colder weather and harsh weather will exacerbate this. In general, five years from date of manufacture (stamped on the tire) is about as old as you ever want to go in a car you plan to drive quickly. If that car (or the tires themselves) are stored in a climate-controlled facility under perfect conditions, maybe you could squeeze an extra year or two out of them. But the fact is, if you have a few cars, some maybe that you only drive a few times a year, replacing tires can easily become a dangerous afterthought.", "New research from Consumer Reports shows that pregnant women should avoid all tuna, contrary to the Food and Drug Administration's description of light canned tuna as a fish \"lower in mercury.\" \"Tuna happens to be one of the fish that can be very high in mercury, and some types of tuna have higher levels than others,\" Jean Halloran, Director of Food Policy Initiative at Consumer Reports told The Huffington Post. \"The type that tends to get used in sushi is often very high, but even canned light tuna, which tends to average pretty low levels and is generally one of the safer fish to eat, occasionally has these spikes of high levels of mercury.\" Because pregnant woman can't tell which individual cans may have higher levels of tuna, Consumer Reports recommends that pregnant women simply skip all tuna throughout their entire pregnancy. The findings were published online Thursday on online and will appear in the Oct. 2014 issue of the nonprofit's magazine, Consumer Reports. The FDA's advice on light canned tuna is from 2004, and the federal agency is poised to overhaul all its advice on seafood consumption soon, reports the Wall Street Journal. But a draft of the new recommendations, subject to final approval, still lists light canned tuna as a low-mercury fish for vulnerable groups. Seafood contains nutrients like protein, iron and omega-3 fatty acids, which are especially vital for the growth and brain development of fetuses, breastfeeding babies and young children. But certain kinds of seafood, especially larger fish, can contain a neurotoxin called methylmercury (commonly referred to as simply \"mercury\") that can cause severe birth defects like blindness, deafness and mental retardation if fetuses are exposed to the metal in utero. Canned tuna was once the most widely-consumed type of seafood in the U.S., and in 2012 still came in second, after shrimp. Despite the rankings, all canned seafood, of which tuna is the leader, dropped to its lowest level in more than 15 years, reports the Washington Post -- perhaps because of health concerns like mercury. Currently, the FDA recommends that pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children also stay away from shark, swordfish, king mackarel and tilefish -- recommendations that Consumer Reports agrees with. But when it comes to the FDA's recommendations of which seafood those groups should eat, the government agency stops short of a comprehensive list, save these suggestions: salmon, shrimp, pollock, tilapia, catfish, cod and light canned tuna, about two to three times a week. To give people a wider selection of low-mercury seafood, CR took the Environmental Protection Agency's data on the average amount of mercury per fish and listed them into two groups: \"Lowest\" mercury and \"Lower\" mercury as part of their report. \"The best fish on the list is salmon,\" said Halloran. \"Virtually all the canned salmon in stores is wild Alaskan salmon, and it's a very good substitute for canned tuna -- it's just a little more work, because you have to take the bones out.\" To see Consumer Report's list of the 17 best seafoods with low mercury levels, check out the slideshow below.

They said: They were all over each other \u2013 hugging and kissing \u2013 even though there were 20 people coming and going on the beach. They looked like any young couple madly in love without a care in the world. Apparently, after his night of dancing, Tom described Taylor as \u2018very charming\u2019 before adding \u2018she\u2019s amazing\u2019. The pair have now become very close, with a source close to Swift revealing: \"Tom has been courting Taylor since they met \u2013 he sent her flowers.

But a new study suggests that raising a ton of money doesn't predict how much success a crowdfunding project will ultimately find.  Researchers at North Carolina State University found that the number of people who supported a project on Kickstarter \u2014 rather than how much money the project raked in \u2014 was the real indicator of whether a product would succeed.  The study, published this month in the journal Research Policy, followed 1,000 successful Kickstarter campaigns in technology, product design, hardware and video games. All participants who responded raised at least $10,000 from an average of 1,078 backers.  SEE ALSO: 3.5 million people supported Kickstarter projects in 2016 \"The first key finding was that the amount of money a crowdfunding entrepreneur raised was inconsequential to their product\u2019s ultimate success in the market,\" lead researcher Michael Stanko said in a statement.  For one, raising a lot more money didn't make founders any more likely to meet their goals for sales or profit once they entered the marketplace. That was because the difference in funding wasn't enough to help founders spend more on advertising or do anything else that would actually translate into more sales. Beyond that, raising extra money indicated that founders started to lose focus and stop innovating on bigger ideas. Faced with the pressure of a massively successful Kickstarter campaign, founders started to get slightly overwhelmed.  SEE ALSO: Vegans, this plant-based leather wallet is made just for you The only factor that actually indicated how successful a product would be when it moved beyond Kickstarter? How many backers it had.  Another study this year found that crowdfunding did help founders in parts of the country besides New York and Silicon Valley nab funding from venture capitalists.  So don't sweat it if your big idea doesn't meet its Kickstarter fundraising goal. It's all about exposure \u2014 to more backers, and to the big money paying attention.

The Huffington Post confirmed the 32-year-old new mom just signed with Slate PR co-founder Ina Treciokas, after splitting with longtime publicist Jill Fritzo, who still represents the rest of the Kardashian family. Sources told the New York Post that the reality star made the jump to new representation because she \"wants to set herself apart from the Kardashian p.r. machine, and Kanye West advised her to build her own team.\" The move doesn't come as a shock, since the Kardashian-Jenner family and their reps currently have their hands full with Lamar Odom's alleged drug scandal. And as branding experts chimed in to say that Odom's reported drug problems could spell the end of the Kardashian empire as we know it, it's no surprise that Kim would take proactive measures to ensure the longevity of her own career.", "Under Armour Inc., the maker of athletic clothing and gear, is acquiring the MyFitnessPal and Endomondo applications for a total of about $560 million in a bid to become the world\u2019s biggest tracker of fitness information. The two apps will complement the company\u2019s current software -- MapMyFitness and UA Record -- giving it a total of 120 million users, according to a statement Wednesday. The company also reported better-than-projected results for the fourth quarter. The move is part of Under Armour\u2019s efforts to lock in customers with technology and services -- rather than just shoes and T-shirts. It bought MapMyFitness Inc. for $150 million in 2013, playing catch-up with competitors like Nike Inc., which was a pioneer in activity tracking. \"There is an overall halo effect,\" for the Under Armour brand, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank said in an interview. The applications also generate revenue with premium versions and advertising, he said. Under Armour shares gained 1 percent to $73.57 at the close in New York. The stock increased 41 percent during the past 12 months, outpacing the 16 percent rise in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. Deal Terms Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. MyFitnessPal, based in San Francisco, offers a program that helps monitor fitness goals. Under Armour agreed to pay $475 million for the business, which has more than 80 million registered users. Endomondo is a Copenhagen-based social network with its own mobile app devoted to fitness with 20 million members -- mostly outside the U.S. Under Armour completed its acquisition of that company last month for $85 million. Both apps, along with MapMyFitness, will automatically sync to UA Record, so users can track all their performances and data from one place. Plank said he envisions UA Record, which has a mobile application and was announced last month, as a daily health dashboard. Nike has a similar digital platform under the Nike+ brand. Over the years, it has ranged from mobile applications to watches that track a user\u2019s runs to the Fuelband bracelet. Now Nike looks like it\u2019s shifting away from hardware. After trying to build digital products on its own, Under Armour realized it would be easier to look for acquisitions, Plank said. These deals also helped the company acquire tech talent, he said. Under Armour has no plans to make its own wearable devices because it\u2019s too difficult and costly, Plank said. The company has made three acquisitions in its history and they\u2019ve all been to help it build an online following through digital tools. \"It\u2019s incredibly difficult\" to keep trying to make a \"better mousetrap every six months,\" he said. HTC Partnership Under Armour announced a licensing deal with HTC Corp. last month in which HTC devices will exclusively use UA Record to track activity, Plank said. The first HTC device under this agreement is expected to be a smartwatch, a person familiar with the matter said last month. Plank founded Under Armour as an apparel company in the 1990s, making workout shirts from synthetic materials that soaked up sweat better than cotton. After the idea took off, Under Armour maintained growth by pushing into categories such as shoes and casual wear. The company, now the largest U.S. sporting-goods maker after Nike, also has expanded distribution overseas. Sales Growth That\u2019s helped Under Armour double sales about every three years. The company expects the rate of growth to slow to 22 percent this year as it enters fewer international markets, its lowest rate since 2009. The slowdown is putting more pressure on the company to expand its customer base with products such as the mobile apps. In the fourth quarter, net income rose 37 percent to $87.7 million, or 40 cents a share, from $64.2 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. That topped the 39 cents that analysts had estimated on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 31 percent to $895.2 million, beating the $848.7 million estimated by analysts.", "What's a million dollar between friends?

It's the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song contest and the organisers have added a surprising wildcard in the form of Australia - a country not traditionally in Europe. Or factually. Or even metaphorically. But the contest has had a cult following Down Under (think how much we liked Neighbours and Prisoner Cell Block H) for many years and has been given a one-off invitation this year. An Australian jury panel will submit the Australian vote and Australia may well be televoting along with other European countries. This seems plausible as Australia has run its own online vote (which has no bearing on the competition) since 2010. And one of the Aussies' more successful musical exports (apart from Nick Cave, Kylie and INXS) is of course Bjorn Again - the wildly successful parody act which pays tribute to Eurovision's most famous winner, Abba. Here's their version of Waterloo (which won Eurovision for the Swedes in 1974). Check out those bell-bottoms. Those judo outfits. That hair! When is it on? The 2015 Song Contest takes place this Saturday with Graham Norton supplying his usual commentary. It is set to air on BBC One and BBC Radio 2 at 8pm. If Australians want to watch the contest live, it will be aired by Australian broadcaster SBS at 5am Sunday morning Australian Eastern Standard Time, and repeated later at 7.30pm Sunday night. Where is it being held? After Austria's Conchita Wurst won last year, the 2015 Eurovison Song Contest will travel to her home country. The show will come live from the Wiener Stadthalle in Vienna. So what's the deal? The bookies have made X Factor Australia judge Guy Sebastian one of the favourites to win in Vienna. The Malaysian-born singer-songwriter was the first winner of Australian Idol in 2003, and signalled his intent by penning a whole slew of potential songs in just three days. The one that made the cut is an jaunty R&B jam called Tonight Again which echoes Mark Ronson's recent global smash Uptown Funk. For those who may have woken up from a deep sleep, This is Uptown Funk: And the bookies odds are..? Sweden is the favourite to take this year's crown with M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w's track 'Heroes', being listed at 7/4 to win by William Hill. So what if Guy wins it for Australia? Now here's an interesting one. Traditionally the winning country is the host of next year's contest so if Australia takes the prize will the whole of Europe have to traipse over to Oz in a sea of sequins and glitter? No-one is sure. Organisers have said that Australia can't host the competition, but their broadcaster SBS could co-organise the event with another European country where the contest would take place. And will Australia be invited to defend their title? This hasn't been confirmed either but it's likely that they will be permitted an entry if the move is a hit with the viewers. It's an 'historic' step which will take the contest to a 'new global level' say the organisers. Michael Ebeid, managing director of broadcaster SBS, which airs the show in Australia, said: \"We are very excited to have secured this historic opportunity for Australia to be represented on the world's biggest stage at the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest and are honoured that the European Broadcasting Union has supported us to achieve this ambition. \"SBS has been broadcasting Eurovision for over 30 years and we have seen how Australians' love of the song contest has grown during those years.\" Executive supervisor of the contest Jon Ola Sand who works for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said: \"It's a daring and at the same time incredibly exciting move. It is our way of saying 'let's celebrate this party together'.\" Alexander Wrabetz director general of host broadcasters ORF, said: \"The song contest has developed in its history to become the biggest TV entertainment event in the world. \"With the participation of Australia, together with our partners at the EBU and SBS, we have succeeded to lift it to a new global level and to build another bridge for the 60th anniversary - a bridge that spans the globe, starting from the heart of Europe.\" Electro Velvet are the UK's entrant for this year's Eurovision Song Contest.", "If you're going through a tumultuous breakup and your otherwise hostile ex insists on \"being friends,\" science is here to give you a little tough love: Run in the opposite direction. According to a new study, some people with the so-called \"dark triad\" personality traits -- like narcissism and psychopathy -- keep their exes around for strategic, self serving reasons. Previous research and expert analysis suggests that individuals with dark personality traits like psychopathy engage in behaviors and relationships that are beneficial for their personal gain. Researchers from Oakland University wanted see if this theory also applied to connections with former partners. In the first part of their study, the researchers asked more than 300 participants to name reasons why they would want to be friends with an ex. Then, they narrowed these reasons down to seven concrete categories, such as \"reliability/sentimentality,\" \"pragmatism,\" and \"sexual access.\" The researchers assigned high scores to positive categories (like a former partner was \"reliable, trustworthy and of sentimental value\"), and lower scores to more negative categories (practicality and sexual access). Then, for the second experiment, they gave the list of seven categories to approximately 500 new participants, and asked each of them to rank the categories in order of personal importance to them. These new participants were also given clinical assessments that measured their prevalence of dark personality traits. The results revealed, unsurprisingly, that highly ranking a practical reason for remaining friends with an ex predicted a clinical assessment of narcissism or psychopathy. The findings \"suggest that [a post-relationship friendship] may provide opportunity for ex-partners to exchange desirable resources (e.g., love, status, information, money, sex) after romantic relationship dissolution,\" the study authors wrote in their conclusion. Translation: Not everyone's post-breakup intentions are pure -- particularly if they have dark personalities. It's not a bad idea to proceed with caution when it comes to an ex. The findings offer some fascinating insight on human relationships, specifically when it comes to emotional turmoil. Experts say that maintaining a relationship after a falling out is difficult, especially because -- surprise! -- ulterior motives may be at play. \"[Exes] are less emotionally supportive, less helpful, less trusting, and less concerned about the other person\u2019s happiness,\" Juliana Breines, a social experience researcher and postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University, wrote in a Psychology Today blog. \"This is especially true, not surprisingly, for former partners who were dissatisfied with the romantic relationship, and in cases when the break-up was not mutual.\" That isn't to say that all exes are terrible people only using you for their pleasure. It is very possible to have a cordial relationship with a former partner. The basic takeaway here is, if it doesn't feel like a real friendship to you, or things ended badly, there could be a less-than-kosher reason your ex tries to maintain the connection.", "EA Finally Reveals Why Star Wars: Battlefront Didn\u2019t Have A Single Player Campaign Image: starwars.ea.com Executive Vice President of EA Studios, Patrick Soderlund discussed why Star Wars Battlefront didn\u2019t have single player campaign while speaking during EA\u2019s Investor Day event. Soderlund also hinted that the single player campaign might be introduced in the sequel of the game. The EA Studios boss mentioned that the decision to leave out the campaign mode from Star Wars Battlefront was purposeful. He said that the decision had to be made in order to release the game early to meet the Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It is notable that Battlefront had content from Jakku which was also relevant in The Force Awakens. The game, however was based on the original Star Wars Trilogy. Although the game was a commercial success, Soderlund said that he wasn\u2019t happy with the average review score of the game. The game scores 72 in the PC and PlayStation 4 versions and 75 on Xbox One version on Metacritic. He said, \"The one thing that we got criticized for was the lack of a single-player campaign. It was conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side-by-side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact.\" \"I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I would say the game has done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional EA game. So from that perspective, it\u2019s a success. Are we happy with the 75 rating? No. Is that something we\u2019re going to cure going forward? Absolutely,\" he added. Despite not having a single-player campaign mode, Battlefront does have solo and offline \u2018Missions\u2019. He also detailed how EA is looking into the \u2018depth and breadth\u2019 before starting a new project. \"The depth and breadth is something that\u2019s proving to be more and more important,\" he said. \"In a world where we want $60 up front and we expect people to stay with us over the course of a long time, the depth of what we offer is important.\" Soderlund added, \"We have to go back and course correct that for another version if we were ever to build one.\" On the other hand, EA CFO Blake Jorgenssen said last week that they were working on a sequel to Battlefront which will include content from the recent movies and have better and bigger worlds. Keeping in mind, Soderlund\u2019s comments, it is safe to assume that the sequel will also feature a single-player campaign, which is bound to strike the right chords with fans.", "Russian microminiaturist Vladimir Aniskin broke the Guinness World Record for World's Tiniest Book this week, which might leave you to wonder, just how small is the World's Tiniest Book?

Aniskin's books unseated a tiny Japanese tome, titled Flowers of the Four Seasons, which measured 0.74 x 0.75 millimeters. The Siberian artist's two books are a near-microscopic 0.07 x 0.09 millimeters. That's small enough to fit on a halved poppy seed, and you'll need a sharpened needle to turn the pages. The artist's two volumes are Alphabet and Levsha: a seven-page Russian alphabet book and a four-page list of other talented microminiaturists. Levsha is the name of the protagonist of an 1881 story about a man who makes horseshoes for a clockwork flea. RT reports that Levsha \"lists the names of the masters who managed to achieve similar skill, including\" himself. The process of making microminiature art is so painstaking that Aniskin's heartbeat can ruin his work. He tells RT: \"The main difficulty is your own heartbeat, a heartbeat that reaches your finger tips and gets passed on to the instrument, which, in turn, starts fluttering in tune with the heartbeat. You only have half of a second to make the required motion.\" [Embed] Aniskin has worked as a microminiaturist since 1998. Some of his work is on display at a microminiaturist museum in St. Petersburg. In addition to the World's Tiniest Book, Aniskin also created \"a caravan of camels inside the eye of a needle, a scene from Winnie the Pooh and set of chess pieces placed on poppy seeds, and a copy of a Sochi Olympic medal, which in only 2 milliliters in diameter.\" Image: kelly taylor/flickr", "\u00a9 Joe Raedle Couple getting married It's one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us. We go to great lengths to avoid it. And yet we do it all the same: We marry the wrong person. Partly, it\u2019s because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others. We seem normal only to those who don\u2019t know us very well. In a wiser, more self-aware society than our own, a standard question on any early dinner date would be: \"And how are you crazy?\" Perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us or can relax only when we are working; perhaps we\u2019re tricky about intimacy after sex or clam up in response to humiliation. Nobody\u2019s perfect. The problem is that before marriage, we rarely delve into our complexities. Whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws, we blame our partners and call it a day. As for our friends, they don\u2019t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us. One of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with. Our partners are no more self-aware. Naturally, we make a stab at trying to understand them. We visit their families. We look at their photos, we meet their college friends. All this contributes to a sense that we\u2019ve done our homework. We haven\u2019t. Marriage ends up as a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don\u2019t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating. For most of recorded history, people married for logical sorts of reasons: because her parcel of land adjoined yours, his family had a flourishing business, her father was the magistrate in town, there was a castle to keep up, or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation of a holy text. And from such reasonable marriages, there flowed loneliness, infidelity, abuse, hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors. The marriage of reason was not, in hindsight, reasonable at all; it was often expedient, narrow-minded, snobbish and exploitative. That is why what has replaced it \u2014 the marriage of feeling \u2014 has largely been spared the need to account for itself. What matters in the marriage of feeling is that two people are drawn to each other by an overwhelming instinct and know in their hearts that it is right. Indeed, the more imprudent a marriage appears (perhaps it\u2019s been only six months since they met; one of them has no job or both are barely out of their teens), the safer it can feel. Recklessness is taken as a counterweight to all the errors of reason, that catalyst of misery, that accountant\u2019s demand. The prestige of instinct is the traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable reason. But though we believe ourselves to be seeking happiness in marriage, it isn\u2019t that simple. What we really seek is familiarity \u2014 which may well complicate any plans we might have had for happiness. We are looking to recreate, within our adult relationships, the feelings we knew so well in childhood. The love most of us will have tasted early on was often confused with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent\u2019s warmth or scared of his anger, of not feeling secure enough to communicate our wishes. How logical, then, that we should as grown-ups find ourselves rejecting certain candidates for marriage not because they are wrong but because they are too right \u2014 too balanced, mature, understanding and reliable \u2014 given that in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign. We marry the wrong people because we don\u2019t associate being loved with feeling happy. We make mistakes, too, because we are so lonely. No one can be in an optimal frame of mind to choose a partner when remaining single feels unbearable. We have to be wholly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to be appropriately picky; otherwise, we risk loving no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us that fate. Finally, we marry to make a nice feeling permanent. We imagine that marriage will help us to bottle the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us: Perhaps we were in Venice, on the lagoon, in a motorboat, with the evening sun throwing glitter across the sea, chatting about aspects of our souls no one ever seemed to have grasped before, with the prospect of dinner in a risotto place a little later. We married to make such sensations permanent but failed to see that there was no solid connection between these feelings and the institution of marriage. Indeed, marriage tends decisively to move us onto another, very different and more administrative plane, which perhaps unfolds in a suburban house, with a long commute and maddening children who kill the passion from which they emerged. The only ingredient in common is the partner. And that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle. The good news is that it doesn\u2019t matter if we find we have married the wrong person. We mustn\u2019t abandon him or her, only the founding Romantic idea upon which the Western understanding of marriage has been based the last 250 years: that a perfect being exists who can meet all our needs and satisfy our every yearning. WE need to swap the Romantic view for a tragic (and at points comedic) awareness that every human will frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us \u2014 and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. But none of this is unusual or grounds for divorce. Choosing whom to commit ourselves to is merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for. This philosophy of pessimism offers a solution to a lot of distress and agitation around marriage. It might sound odd, but pessimism relieves the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon marriage. The failure of one particular partner to save us from our grief and melancholy is not an argument against that person and no sign that a union deserves to fail or be upgraded. The person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste (he or she doesn\u2019t exist), but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently \u2014 the person who is good at disagreement. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate differences with generosity that is the true marker of the \"not overly wrong\" person. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it must not be its precondition. Romanticism has been unhelpful to us; it is a harsh philosophy. It has made a lot of what we go through in marriage seem exceptional and appalling. We end up lonely and convinced that our union, with its imperfections, is not \"normal.\" We should learn to accommodate ourselves to \"wrongness,\" striving always to adopt a more forgiving, humorous and kindly perspective on its multiple examples in ourselves and in our partners.", ". .

(Will Wei, Business Insider The doldrums, he explained, are a region on the Earth\u2019s surface where air doesn\u2019t move horizontally. \"It either goes directly down, directly upward, or doesn\u2019t move at all,\" he said. \"If you accidentally sail into that zone and all you have is windpower, you die there.\" So it\u2019s safe to say that the doldrums are a pretty bad place to be. And considering that many people, including Tyson, consider innovations in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to be intertwined with the economic health of the nation, we might want to get out of the science doldrums \u2014 fast. \"Everything we know about science and technology tells us that they are the engines of future economies,\" Tyson told Business Insider. \"They are the seeds of tomorrow\u2019s growth of wealth. I\u2019m not going to twist your arm to get you to like science, but I don\u2019t have to twist arm to make you like money. If you don\u2019t want to die poor you should invest in STEM.\" So how do we get out of these science doldrums? By focusing on education and getting the nation\u2019s young, bright minds interested in science. And we\u2019re not just talking about the kind of science you get out of high school textbooks. Tyson stressed the importance of informal education \u2014 school trips to museums, research projects, participating in competitions. Research in education has shown that school trips taken in elementary school are remembered long into adulthood, Tyson said, adding that he still remembers a trip he took in 2nd grade to the post office. \"These are the seeds planted within children,\" he said. \"And those seeds gain taproots.\" The press conference, held at the American Museum of Natural History, announced biotech company Regeneron as the new $100 million sponsor for the \u2018Nobel Prize of high school science competitions\u2019 \u2014 the Science Talent Search (STS). One of the founders of Regeneron, and an alumna of the STS, just happened to be Tyson\u2019s friend and classmate at the Bronx High School of Science. Although Tyson himself never entered the competition, he said that being surrounded by classmates who participated and won was a point of pride for him. These kids, he said, became heroes in their hometown, just like football quarterbacks or the center for a basketball team. \"The fact that you can do that with kids interested in science is an important first step to reinvigorate the country,\" Tyson said. \"To turn a sleepy country into an innovation nation.\" Personal Finance - Career & Education Investing Education Neil deGrasse Tyson Business Insider Our country is in the science doldrums, Neil deGrasse Tyson said at a press conference on Thursday.", "WASHINGTON -- Arizona lawmakers are pushing to provide elected officials with more privacy as they draft legislation because they say the state's requirements for open meetings make it too difficult for them to do their jobs. The plan, proposed by state Sen. Sylvia Allen (R), would allow lawmakers to meet privately to negotiate and draft measures and would require them to have public debate only once a body takes an action, such as a vote. Arizona's current laws require that officials hold a public meeting any time a quorum discusses matters that could result in legal action. State Sen. Carlyle Begay (D), one of the bill's co-sponsors, told The Huffington Post that the state's requirements on open meetings make it extremely difficult for lawmakers who represent rural areas, where officials have to travel hours to be in the same room, to accomplish anything. That can make it hard for officials to deal with matters that need urgent and swift attention, Begay said. \"It's a way to update how our elected officials are able to converse to associate with elected officials they sit on boards with in a way that allows them to do their business, to advocate and represent the best interests of their communities a lot easier,\" Begay said. \"Right now it's a hardship for these officials because they have to post open meeting laws and post notice for simple discussions if they need to get together to address issues.\" Begay said the bill isn't intended to give lawmakers an opportunity to discuss \"unethical or immoral criminal issues behind closed doors.\" \"We're all held to a certain standard and I think that's the expectation that we're not trying to decrease transparency and openness but we're leaving that discretion to the elected officials themselves to ensure that when public input and public comment is needed that they do that,\" he said. In fact, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun that the state's open meetings laws produce an undemocratic law-making process. Because officials aren't allowed to meet privately to discuss legislation, officials must send staffers to serve as a go-between among colleagues to reach a consensus. That process, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun, is undemocratic because it allows unelected staff members to play a central role in drafting laws. \"Staff wasn't elected, staff isn't accountable,\" Allen told the Daily Sun. Dan Barr, a First Amendment lawyer with the firm Perkins Coie, said the time when a policy is deliberated before a measure is introduced is a critical point for public input. \"It allows you to see how your various public officials are approaching their jobs, how they view certain issues, what their thought process is, what their reasoning process is,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"It allows people then to participate in that.\" Barr added that open meetings laws shouldn't be weakened just because they make the lives of elected officials more difficult. \"Efficiency in government is not the primary goal of a democracy,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"Our whole theory of government is that the people are the governors and that they give limited power to the government, and for the public to adequately assess what its government is doing, it needs as much transparency as possible.\"", "Each time it happened, Johanna Dickson thought it was something she had eaten. The first attack struck while Dickson, then 23 and just back from a vacation in South Africa, was attending a party in New York. She assumed that the piercing abdominal pains might be a legacy of her trip or, more likely, the consequence of bad sushi she had consumed before the party. As the pain worsened, Dickson remembers wondering, \"Is this what childbirth is like?\" The next morning she saw her family doctor in New Jersey, who sent her to the hospital for tests. Soon afterward, the symptoms disappeared, and when testing revealed nothing, Dickson said she \"moved on.\" Six months later, she experienced a second episode, followed by another a year later. The third attack would end far differently than the first two: Doctors at a New Jersey hospital decided that, based on the results of her CT scan, Dickson needed emergency surgery. [Doctors dismissed his pain as migraines. Then they said he had 24 hours to live.] Johanna Dickson thought her excruciating stomach pains were caused by food poisoning at first. It soon became clear the issue was more serious, but Dickson's eventual diagnosis shocked both her and her doctors. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) \"Something like this is very strange in a 24-year-old,\" said Kenneth A. Goldman, the surgeon who operated on Dickson in August 2008. Goldman said he approached her case with some trepidation, \"hoping for the best and assuming the worst.\" For Dickson, who now works as a book publicist in Manhattan, the first episode was a surprise. She had felt fine on vacation and been generally healthy during the previous year she had spent in South Africa on a college study program. Because she had worked with orphans who had HIV, Dickson underwent testing for infectious diseases after she returned to the United States from her year abroad. \"I assumed if there was anything serious, I\u2019d find out about it,\" she recalled. The second attack, which caused stabbing pain so intense it woke her from sleep, passed fairly quickly; this time, she didn\u2019t go to the doctor. But the pain during the third episode was much worse. Dickson, who was then living with her parents near Princeton, said that it began in the middle of the night and grew so unbearable that she began screaming. Her mother held her and tried to soothe her; in the morning, her parents rushed her to the doctor\u2019s office. He decided that Dickson probably had food poisoning \u2014 she had bought fruit from a street vendor the previous day. Although her pain, which was mostly on her left side, seemed somewhat lessened, the doctor told Dickson\u2019s parents that if it didn\u2019t subside by noon, she should go to the hospital for an abdominal CT scan. One possibility was acute appendicitis, although that typically causes pain on the right side. [He couldn\u2019t eat, drink or work. And doctors couldn\u2019t explain his searing pain.] Dickson was little better by noon, and her parents took her to the hospital. Several hours later, an ER doctor entered the room and asked a series of rapid-fire questions. \"He wanted to know if I\u2019d ever given birth, or had surgery or had a family history of colon problems,\" Dickson recalled. 1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The case files: Medical mysteries View Photos From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here\u2019s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases. Caption From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here\u2019s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases. Doctors were stumped by this 2-year-old boy\u2019s symptoms. He had swollen thumbs, bleeding gums and anemia. He cried whenever anyone touched his legs. Doctors were running out of time. Read the case Cam Cottrill/For The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The answer to each question was no. \"Why?\" Dickson remembers her father inquiring. The doctor explained that the CT scan showed that Dickson\u2019s pain was the result of a serious bowel obstruction. The most likely cause at her age was scar tissue from previous surgery. Another possibility was an inflammation of her colon. Because Dickson had never had any surgery \u2014 she had never been in a hospital \u2014 and no history of colon problems, doctors had no idea what was causing the obstruction. A surgeon was on his way to see her and would decide whether she needed an operation or whether the problem might resolve without it. [A simple test proved that a teen with stomach pain wasn\u2019t a hypochondriac after all] A bowel obstruction occurs when the large or small intestine is partially or totally blocked, preventing food, fluids and gas from passing normally. It typically causes severe pain that may wax and wane. Through a morphine haze, Dickson remembers feeling terrified about the prospect of surgery. Goldman told Dickson and her parents that surgery was essential. \"I remember hearing something about my intestine being really badly tangled and that it was something you [usually] see in people over 60.\" The primary concern was that the obstruction was cutting off the blood supply to Dickson\u2019s colon; an operation to untwist the intestine and relieve the obstruction was the only treatment. Causes of a blockage include a hernia; Crohn\u2019s disease, a disorder that causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract; previous abdominal surgery, including a Caesarean section, which results in the formation of scar tissue; and a tumor. Goldman remembers wondering what he would find. \"I\u2019ve seen 25-year-olds with metastatic colon cancer,\" he said. Shortly before 7 p.m., Dickson was wheeled into surgery. A surprising discovery In the operating room, Goldman discovered the source of the obstruction: a tumor the size of a plum in Dickson\u2019s small intestine. He sent samples of the tumor \u2014 called frozen sections \u2014 to the pa\u00adthol\u00adogy lab and waited for the initial report. [She couldn\u2019t stop coughing. Were fragrances to blame?] The pathologist found that the specimen contained abnormally shaped spindle cells \u2014 round in the middle with pointed ends. Because such a finding is rare and its implications unclear, Dickson\u2019s pa\u00adthol\u00adogy samples were subsequently sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for a second opinion. In the meantime, Goldman decided that in case Dickson did have an invasive cancer, he needed to remove enough of her intestine \u2014 about 10 inches \u2014 to ensure that no malignancy remained. Dickson said she suffered no ill effects from the surgery. The next morning, Dickson recalled, Goldman explained that the first two episodes had probably been caused by the bowel partially twisting around the tumor and then untwisting. Once the tumor grew too large, surgery was essential. The Mayo pathologists classified the tumor as an extremely fibrous growth called a desmoid, a slow-growing mass that typically affects women younger than 40. Because the tumor was attached to the mesentery, the fold of tissue that connects the small intestine to the abdominal wall, the condition is also called mesenteric fibromatosis. About 900 desmoid tumors are diagnosed annually in the United States. There is disagreement about whether such tumors should be classified as benign \u2014 largely because they do not spread \u2014 or as a low-grade form of cancer. Dickson said she was told her tumor was benign. Surgery to remove desmoid tumors is the preferred treatment, but recurrence is common. Many desmoid tumors, which can develop anywhere in the body, have no known cause. Some occur in people with Gardner syndrome, a type of familial adenomatous polyposis, a genetic disorder that results in frequent colon polyps in adolescence and in early-onset colon cancer. [Why I hid my daughter\u2019s medical diagnosis from her for as long as I could] No recurrence But in Dickson\u2019s case, no genetic link could be found. Dickson said she underwent frequent monitoring the year after her surgery as well as a colonoscopy, which found nothing. She sees an oncologist periodically for follow-up, but so far the tumor has not recurred. In 2013, five years after the surgery, Dickson underwent a second abdominal operation, which involved removal of more of her intestine, to relieve pain caused by scar tissue from the 2008 operation. \"I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, am I going to be doing this every five years?\u2019 \" she remembered wondering. There is no way to prevent a recurrence \u2014 doctors don\u2019t know what caused the tumor \u2014 but Dickson said she is careful about her diet, avoiding fried foods and dried fruit, which she has trouble digesting. These days stomachaches always get her attention. \"If Pepto [Bismol] doesn\u2019t work after about 20 minutes,\" she said, \"I do get a little nervous.\" To Goldman, Dickson remains a singular event in his long surgical career. \"I\u2019ve seen one case of this in my 32 years,\" he said. \"That was Johanna.\"", "Have you stopped wearing razor back and off shoulder tops because of your sagging arms? We feel you because flabby and saggy arms gather all the unwanted attention despite having a pleasing personality and a beautiful face. Underarm fat or 'batwings' as we may say are enough to destroy the whole appearance. Before going further, let's find out how fat gets deposited in the arms? Causes of bat wings Saggy arms often come out from nowhere! This problem is caused due to changes in the body throughout the adulthood. Arm fat occurs because of an excess fat in the body as a result of natural changes with the growing age. Age The age factor is the main cause of this issue. According to Dr. Megha Shah, Cosmetologist, Beauty and Curves Clinic, Surat \"After the age of 30, the body fat tendency increases and the lean muscle tendency normally decreases which leads to the encapsulation of fat.\" Change in Hormones In the recent years, the problem of batwings also emerges after the age of 20. This can also happen because of the hormonal changes as per the age or due to medical treatments that affect the hormones. Change in the hormones decreases the rate of metabolism which results in a reduction in the rate of calories burnt per day.It is obvious that a low-calorie burn leads to the deposition of fat. Lack of Physical Activities Because of lack of time, there is no physical activity which is the main reason behind the production of fat in the body including arms. Overweight This is another reason of batwings. If you are overweight, you are likely to attract flabbiness in your arms. Solutions to Get Rid Of Batwings So, if the bulkiness has taken its way to your arms and create an awkward jiggle while you move, don't worry! There are some easy ways and solutions that can help you reduce those bat wings and achieve toned arms. Workouts and Exercises: There are many workouts that will help to get fat free arms. High-intensity cardio and interval training exercises help in reduction of bat wings. Some common exercises include Push-ups, One-arm triceps, Counter push-ups, Scissors, Weightlifting etc. Proper diet: A regular intake of fruits, veggies and dairy products is a must to maintain a healthy gut that digests the food properly and increases the rate of metabolism. Eating healthy is better than eating less and eating unhygienic like fried food, junk food etc. Try to make a diet chart and follow a balanced diet to ward off underarm fat. Weight Management: Maintaining an ideal weight is the key. By maintaining a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI), we can avoid the excessive deposition of fat in the body. Diet & exercises play a crucial role in weight management. Food items low in sugar, rich in fibre is a must have in your diet. Processed, refined foods should be avoided to a great extent. Skincare Regime: A dry, dehydrated skin highlights your flaws in a big way. Therefore, follow a skin care regime comprising of gentle exfoliation and moisturisation so that your arms look good and replenished. A regular massage with aroma oils not only help you relax but also tones your arm muscles and help you get them in shape. Laser Treatment: The treatment is fast and lasts for a long time and removes the arm fat under the skin effectively. People who don't have time can go for treatment and see its long-lasting results. Venus Freeze is a non-invasive technique that helps in getting toned arms without putting time & effort. It is a harmless treatment. It is truly said that \"prevention is better than cure\". If you are not suffering from this issue doesn't mean this could not happen to you. So it's good to prevent arm fat before it emerges.

If you're anything like me, however, you experience a weird phenomenon that scientists refer to as \"post-micturition convulsion syndrome.\" What could I possibly be talking about?", "(Reuters Health) - High school girls who use the most effective methods of birth control are less likely to also use condoms, making them vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), researchers say. Girls who use intrauterine devices and implants to prevent pregnancies are less likely to use condoms than their peers taking birth control pills, they found. \"The findings highlight a need for strategies to increase condom use among all users of highly and moderately effective contraceptive methods ... to prevent STIs,\" wrote lead researcher Riley Steiner of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, in an email to Reuters Health. Intrauterine and implantable devices are highly effective at reducing unintended pregnancies, the researchers write in JAMA Pediatrics. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) says these devices, which are known as long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), should be first-line birth control options for teenagers. Among 100 women on LARC, there will be about one unintended pregnancy per year, according to ACOG. That's compared to six to nine unintended pregnancies among 100 women using the Depo-Provera shot, birth control pills, rings or patches. For the new study, the researchers used data from a 2013 survey of U.S. high school students in grades nine through 12. Of the 2,288 sexually active girls in the survey, about 2 percent used LARC, about 22 percent used birth control pills, about 41 percent used condoms, about 12 percent used withdrawal or other methods, about 16 percent used no contraceptive method and about 6 percent used the shot, patch or ring. About 2 percent didn't know which method they used. Overall, LARC users were about 60 percent less likely to use condoms, compared to girls taking birth control pills. There was no significant difference in condom use between those using the shot, patch or ring and those using LARC. Steiner said it's unclear why girls on LARC are less likely to use condoms but offered two possible explanations. \"Young women using highly effective LARC methods may be less likely to use condoms because they don\u2019t perceive a need for additional protection from pregnancy; It\u2019s also possible that providers are more likely to offer LARC to adolescents who rarely or never use condoms,\" she said. LARC users were also more likely to have two or more sexual partners in the past three months and four or more lifetime sexual partners, compared to those using the shot, patch, ring and pills. \"The important takeaway message from this story is that we need to be giving girls the right message of why condom use is important,\" said Dr. Julia Potter, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. Steiner said the new results should not deter adolescent LARC use, \"but rather inform how STI prevention is addressed within the context of adolescent LARC scale-up.\" Potter, of Boston Medical Center, also said more research on why girls using LARC aren't using condoms as much is needed so that people aren't basing their opinions on assumptions.", "An Ohio boy got the surprise of a lifetime when police discovered he was trying to sell his teddy bear for food because he was hungry.

I used to find it difficult to get out of bed in the mornings, hitting snooze repeatedly before rushing out the door to start a 12-hour day. But now that I've made some tweaks to my routine, I jump out of bed at 5:55am on the dot   and I've never felt more energized and productive. Being productive starts when you wake up. I'm not the only entrepreneur who knows the power of an early start: Tim Ferriss, Oprah and Apple's Tim Cook all begin their days before sunrise. If you're looking to make the most of those key hours before you hit the office, try out a few of these morning routines for yourself. 1. Set Your Alarm with Precision Why have a super-precise wake-up time? There's something psychological about being specific that tells your brain to pay attention - it's the same reason we do our company morning huddle at 10:55 each morning. I used to set my alarm for around 6:00am, changing the wake-up call by a few minutes forward or back every day and hitting snooze (a lot). Now I don't compromise: it's set for 5:55, and the specific routine is ingrained in my psyche, forcing me out of bed on time. 2. Write Down 1 Daily Intention I head straight from bed to the coffee maker. While my espresso is brewing, I take a moment to set my intention for the day. Writing down your goals makes you significantly more likely to achieve them and I firmly believe that what gets measured, gets done. When I log an intention, I have successful, happy days. On the days I don't, it's harder to focus. I use my iPhone notepad to jot down one goal (just one!) to accomplish in the next 24 hours. These intentions are always simple and attainable. For example, today it was hit the gym; other times it might have to do with how I eat. Though these are related to personal health, taking care of myself ultimately means taking care of my business. 3. Give Yourself a Power Hour This is arguably the most important part of my morning ritual. My kids wake up around 7:00am, so 6:00 to 7:00 is a precious chunk of time for myself. It might mean perfecting my French (one of my 101 Life Goals is to teach a business class en francais), getting in a quick workout, or doing some reading. The one thing I never do during my power hour? Check my email. We've all been guilty of this, but I used to reach for my phone and open my inbox first thing in the morning. I found opening my email so early in the day let other people dictate my priorities, making me reactive instead of proactive. 4. Find a Way to Fuel Your Body Properly Plenty can happen during your 9-to-5 that gets a healthy diet off track. But I find being intentional about the first meal of the day (when willpower is at its peak), means I'm much more successful in maintaining good habits. Right now, I'm using a local meal delivery company called Vital Supply Co to make it extra-easy for me to eat well. They let me choose between different meal options to optimize my energy throughout the day. When I was younger, I would often skip lunch or stuff my face with whatever was around. Now I know that a healthy routine leads to healthy mind and focus, and that you can't be a leader who is confident and energized if you're not fueling your body right. Finding a healthy delivery service has made it impossible for me to miss mealtime. 5. Choose to Use Your Commute Efficiently Though some entrepreneurs may want to (or have to) pull 12 hour days, I've made a conscious choice to prioritize balance and make more time for my physical health and family. While I typically don't get into the office until 8:30 or 9:00, I've found that my 20-minute drive can be utilized to get work done. My assistant schedules interviews and conference calls for when she knows I'm driving and available hands-free, so I can be productive en route. Checking some things off while in transit means I'm able to cut down on actual time at the office. It also results in more creative thinking because I'm mobile and in a different head space. 6. Get a Good Night's Sleep The real secret to a productive morning, though, is the night before. I'm generally in bed around 10 p.m., but before I drift off, I list 10 things I'm grateful for. Especially when I've had a bad day or something's gone wrong, it's a powerful reminder of the progress I've made with family, fitness, and business. Ending my night on a positive note means that, at 5:55 when that alarm goes off, I'm ready to start a new day on the right foot.", "The hole in the space station is superficial but a little unsettling for Earthbound folk. When you sit around imagining life aboard the International Space Station (we all do that, right?) one thing you probably don\u2019t want to think about is space junk slamming into your vessel. And you almost certainly don\u2019t want to imagine a piece of that junk taking a chunk of your spacecraft\u2019s window with it. Especially not when the chipped window in question is the one that provides some of the best views of Earth. [NASA reminds us that astronaut poop burns up \u2018like shooting stars\u2019] But that\u2019s exactly what happened last month in the space station\u2019s Cupola, a European-built 2010 addition that you\u2019re sure to recognize \u2014 it\u2019s where those great pictures and videos showing stunning shots of our planet are taken. \"I am often asked if the International Space Station is hit by space debris,\" British astronaut Tim Peake, who took the freaky photo of the damaged window, said in a statement. \"Yes \u2014 this is the chip in one of our Cupola windows, glad it is quadruple glazed!\" Um, yeah. You can say that again. NASA released an animation depicting space trash in motion around Earth. (YouTube/NASA) The astronauts, of course, are perfectly safe \u2014 they generally don\u2019t tweet photos during life-threatening station crises. And the views are safe, too \u2014 the chip is less than a centimeter across. According to the European Space Agency, the damage was likely caused by something as unassuming as a flake of paint or a metal fragment just a few thousandths of a millimeter across. A FLAKE OF PAINT. Let that sink in. Because of the incredibly high speeds of these orbiting pieces of debris, something 1 centimeter across could disable critical instruments on the space station, and anything larger could penetrate the sturdy shields that protect crew modules. Debris 10 centimeters across could shatter the spacecraft into pieces. In 2013, experts estimated that there were at least 29,000 objects of this size orbiting Earth. The danger posed by errant space debris were dramatized in the 2013 film \"Gravity,\" in which astronauts on a shuttle mission are terrorized by speeding chunks of space junk. Space junk is definitely a real concern. Mashable reports that NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites and old rocket bits orbiting Earth, some no larger than marbles, so that the space station can be maneuvered away from close encounters \u2014 but many small pieces, like the one that hit the space station, are too difficult to keep track of. These days space agencies try to be more mindful of the waste left behind by missions, but no one has found an ideal solution for cleaning up the junk that\u2019s already there.", "\"Hamilton,\" the mega-buzzy bio-musical about Alexander Hamilton and the founding fathers, opened to glowing accolades unlike any in memory. It received 11 Tony Awards, including best musical, and 16 Tony nominations, the most nominations in Broadway history. It won the Pulitzer Prize and a Grammy Award. In his review, Ben Brantley writes: \"Yes, it really is that good.\" It\u2019s one of the most talked about Broadway shows since \"The Book of Mormon\" in 2011. Why? It\u2019s a theatrical rarity: a critically acclaimed work, written by a young composer, that\u2019s making a cultural impact far beyond Broadway\u2019s 40 theaters. That it\u2019s told through the language and rhythms of hip-hop and R&B \u2014 genres that remain mostly foreign to the musical theater tradition \u2014 has put it in contention to redefine what an American musical can look and sound like. As Mr. Brantley wrote in his review of the show Off Broadway, the songs in \"Hamilton\" could be performed \"more or less as they are by Drake or Beyonce\u0301 or Kanye.\" Ethel Merman it ain\u2019t. So what\u2019s the story behind a show that\u2019s become a Broadway must-see with no marquee names, no special effects and almost no white actors? Here, in six snapshots, is an explanation of why \"Hamilton\" is a big deal.", "I\u2019ve already revealed an excellently worded letter written by veterans calling out Trump on his failure to send them the $6 million he cynically promised them. After all, Trump has made a mint out not being held accountable for things he says and you\u2019re an ugly loser for asking. Worse still, how he easily found the time to help pay off the campaign debts of his butt buddy Chris Christie. However, that it was finally revealed that Trump failed to make good on the $6 million pledge has opened up a whole new can of worms. And my apologies to actual worms. In response to the Washington Post\u2019s revelation that Trump never made good on his pledge, VoteVets, a huge progressive veterans group, had some words for Trump. Donald Trump is a cheap fraud,\" said Iraq veteran and VoteVets chairman Jon Soltz in a scathing press release. \"In a classic fraud move, made himself look good to the public, by lying to the American people, and veterans, about how much he raised for veterans\u2019 groups, when he hid behind them to get out of the GOP debate. If there\u2019s anyone with the right to tear down this monumental orange a-hole, it\u2019s a veteran. Trump, a draft dodger who equated a military boarding school to combat, only knows the combat of marketing. The whole thing was just a PR stunt to shield him from having to deal with Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelley. PR, of course, is one thing that Donald Trump knows something about. Soltz now feels we need to question every comment Trump makes with regards to the military, even likening his refusal to release his taxes as a possible cover to conceal his giving to vet groups. We now need to presume that he is lying about how much he claims he has given to veterans over the years, and that\u2019s part of the reason he won\u2019t release his taxes,\" Soltz continued. \"Releasing them would likely show that he\u2019s not given as much to veterans\u2019 groups over the years as he claims \u2013 if he\u2019s even given to them at all. Another lie and another fraud. And still under the mistaken belief that presidential candidates are never to be held accountable, Trump told the Post last month, \"Why should I give you records? I don\u2019t have to give you records.\" But Soltz isn\u2019t buying it and neither should anyone else.", "\"Homeland\" star Damian Lewis has apologized after making a comment about not wanting to be a \"fruity\" actor -- a remark some thought was directed at Sir Ian McKellen. It all began back in October when Lewis was discussing his past work in theater with the Guardian. After a while, he said, the theater life got to him. \"I don't know. It might mean that at heart I'm quite conventional,\" he told the outlet at the time. \"Maybe yearning for something that was a bit more structured. But, of course, preferable to getting on the tube at [7 a.m.] to go to an office and turn in a full solid day... The idea that I would be one of these slightly over-the-top, fruity actors who would have an illustrious career on stage, but wouldn't start getting any kind of film work until I was 50 and then start playing wizards.\" After the interview was published, Lewis' \"fruity\" remark was linked to McKellen. The 74-year-old openly gay actor started in theater before gaining international blockbuster fame with the role of Gandalf in 2001's \"Lord of the Rings.\" McKellen responded to Lewis' comments while speaking with the Radio Times for its Christmas edition. \"So he feels sorry for me, does he? Well I'm very happy, he needn't worry about me,\" he said. Per the Independent, he continued: \"To rebut it: I wouldn't like to have been one of those actors who hit stardom quite early on and expected it to continue and was stuck doing scripts that I didn't particularly like just to keep the income up. I've always wanted to get better as an actor. And I have got better. You've only got to see my early work to see that.\" He attributed his \"fruity\" voice to having been trained to get his voice to fill up a room, similar to that of an opera singer. On Wednesday, Lewis issued a statement apologizing to McKellen. Via the Guardian: I am hugely embarrassed that comments of mine have been linked in a negative way to Sir Ian McKellen. I have always been, and continue to be, an enormous fan and admirer of Sir Ian's. He's one of the greats and one of the reasons I became an actor. My comment in the Guardian was a soundbite I've been giving since 1999 \u2013 it was a generic analogy that was never intended to demean or describe anyone else's career. I have contacted Sir Ian McKellen and have given him my sincerest apologies. The \"Hobbit\" star took it all in stride and tweeted about the incident Thursday. There was no need for @Lewis_Damian to apologise to me, as I thought his comments were fair. But he's a gentleman. \u2014 Ian McKellen (@IanMcKellen) December 12, 2013", "When Snap CEO Evan Spiegel described Spectacles\u2014his company's first piece of hardware, a pair of video-shooting sunglasses\u2014in a September Wall Street Journal story, he called them a \"toy.\" There's more than one type of a toy in this world, however, and there's one Spectacles use case we're not yet seeing, at least not publicly: Spectacles as a sex toy. Of course, behind closed doors, it's already happened. \"It was the first thing I thought as we were waiting in line,\" said media entrepreneur Rachel, who bought a pair from the first popup shop in Venice Beach with the guy she's seeing. (Names of users have been changed by Mashable at their request for privacy.) SEE ALSO: People are already hacking their Snapchat Spectacles Rachel's not alone. Financial analyst Richard was interested in filming himself in the act with a recent girlfriend. He saw the perfect opportunity, when he got a pair of Spectacles from the shop in New York. \"It seemed easy, and better than a phone,\" he told Mashable. \"I liked my point of view instead of a side table, because it feels more authentic. I was there, and this is what I'm seeing, and I remember what I was feeling when I re-watch the videos.\" Snap will soon be a big, public company, but not that long ago it was just an app commonly associated with sexting. Its foundation in disappearing messages\u2014the once-unique feature that made Snapchat a must-have\u2014made sending naughty material seem less risky, even if it's with a complete stranger. And sure, Snapchat's built out their product to appeal to different users, in different ways, via the news-focused Live Stories and publisher perspectives on Discover (which is a Mashable partner). But by releasing a physical product like Spectacles, Snap Inc. has repositioned itself as a lifestyle tech company. And with this comes the potential, of course, for innovations in sexual pleasure and fun. To wit, take our friend Richard's feedback: \"The circular video part\"\u2014which is how Spectacles films footage, where users watching Spectacle-shot media can look around the footage, simply by moving their phone\u2014\"was really cool.\" \"By turning my phone,\" he continued, \"I get a whole new vantage point.\" Of his own amateur sex footage, he means. And maybe, one day, someone else's. The idea was an obvious one for some Snapchat users, Rachel and Richard included. Right after the initial Spectacles rollout, people were already cracking the same joke on social media. The idea was practically floated by Snap themselves in the marketing for Spectacles\u2014photos of models, donning the sunglasses, while shirtless. you have to be naked to use spectacles fyi pic.twitter.com/klm9kZM7B2 \u2014 Damon Beres \u2728 (@dlberes) September 24, 2016 How will sex tapes change after Spectacles? \u2014 Alex Micu (@axelk) September 27, 2016 Snapchat Spectacles are gonna be great for filming realistic porn because A) the camera is at your eye level B) it lasts ten seconds pic.twitter.com/QosgVH3j9e \u2014 Gary He (@garyhe) September 24, 2016 But you know what they say\u2014there's truth in every joke. And this one's time is coming. Given the limited availability of Snapchat Spectacles, the sexual accessorizing of them has yet to begin in earnest. Mashable reached out to more than two dozen Spectacles owners and found that the majority hadn't engaged in any sexual act with their new toy. Yet\u2014most of them have at least had the idea. \"I hadn't thought about that as a personal use, but one of my first thoughts was when we'd see this pop up in porn,\" one early Spectacles owner explained. \"My friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex,\" another said. \"The Specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than Google Glass.\" Of course, there's the idea, and then the execution. And people have definitely been executing on the potential for Spectacles as a sex toy. So far, reviews are mixed. Of the 26 Spectacles owners we spoke with, Mashable did hear from several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex. \"I've used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual, and also, used it in the beginning stages [of sex] when I was still getting intimate with a partner,\" Rachel, the media entrepreneur, said. \"With the glasses on, it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit.\" The experience wasn't seamless. Rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glasses and pass them back and forth during foreplay. Spectacles also only records up to 30 seconds, with the press of the button three times. \"It definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit,\" she said. It wasn't Rachel's first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective Spectacles had to offer, wearing the glasses were a bit distracting, and made her feel more than a little self-conscious. \"There was a barrier, in terms of personal space. I didn\u2019t feel as close to the person, because one of us had the sunglasses on,\" she said. Jennifer, a publicist, said she and her partner both wore them the first time, which felt fun, but two pairs of Spectacles make for strange bedfellows\u2014literally. To say nothing of the viewing, itself. \"We thought we would try it, but the first five minutes we were laughing. I think teal\"\u2014the color of her Spectacles\u2014\"was a bad choice,\" she said. \"I deleted the videos right after, and we tried again.\" A series of 10-, 20- and 30-second clips are now saved on her personal iPhone, which Jennifer said she's privately masturbated to, and also, sent to her boyfriend. While Rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her Spectacles ownership, she was initially concerned about whether or not her videos would post instantly to her Story. They don't. The app saves all Spectacles videos in a dedicated tab within your Snapchat Memories. Still, due to privacy concerns, she downloads the Stories off of the app, deletes them from Snapchat, and then stores them in a personal, private folder. \"I'm a little skeptical about how much Snapchat can see,\" she said. Richard and Jennifer saved their videos in \"My Eyes Only,\" a section of the app protected by a pin code, which Snapchat released back in July. As for professional, non-amateur use in sex, we couldn't track down any examples using Spectacles, but one could still\u2014and isn't unlikely to\u2014show up in the near future. Jesse Adams, co-founder and CEO of adult content app platform MiKandi, says his company is already looking at the potential of Spectacles. \"We haven't gotten our hands on one yet, but with the adult industry, any time there\u2019s a new gadget, we\u2019re very excited in terms of how to explore it,\" he said. His company embraced the first wearable camera, Google Glass, and used it to create an app called \"Tits and Glass\" as well as film a parody porn video back in 2013. \"The question is what appeal will these Spectacles have, if any, to this industry. Will they see these as a different kind of POV niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership,\" said Lynn Comella, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Will it be different from Google Glass?\" Snap declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson pointed to the Snapchat support and safety pages for reference. Spectacles' support page has no direct mention of using Spectacles during sex. The gadget's warnings page addresses flying and driving, however. All sex-related context is, for now, designated to the community guidelines for Snap and Snapchat. That's not too surprising given that Spectacles only upload videos directly to Snapchat. A pornography section of its community guidelines states, \"Snapchat prohibits accounts that use public Stories to distribute sexually explicit content.\" There's no control or limitation to what users do with Snapchat privately, of course. Cindy Gallop, an advertising industry veteran and consultant who is now focused on a social sex site called MakeLoveNotPorn, said she wished Snapchat would be more explicit and embrace the use case. She credited Snapchat's \"explosive growth\"\u2014which now boasts 150 million daily active users\u2014to sexting, and though Mashable can't prove that, it's clearly a part of the app. \"Spectacles can be and will be used in sexual context,\" Gallop said. \"I would love to see Snap be open and active about it. In fact, Spectacles owners have some recommendations. \"The glasses kept slipping off. I remember thinking at the time: I wish there was a strap,\" Richard said. Just as Snapchat inspired a third-party market for app solutions, there's bound to be  accessories for Spectacles.

The oft-discussed issue of uniforms came up in meeting held by the U.K.'s Telegraph reported. A group of six experts, including policymakers, organization leaders, and educators, were summoned in a roundtable format to address members of parliament and discuss their findings on Tuesday. Apparently, the committee attributes online pornography, a culture of victim-blaming, and a systemic misogyny prevalent in society (that would be difficult to address unless wider cultural attitudes are tackled) as reasons why young girls might feel threatened or vulnerable in a skirt at school. The oft-discussed issue of uniforms came up in meeting held by the U.K.'s Women and Equalities Committee , which was created in 2013 to examine gender equality issues.

Between 2011 and 2014, there were 5,500 sexual offenses reported in British schools, according to a 2015 report from the. A Girlguiding survey, also released last year, revealed that 75% of young women have felt anxiety over the possibilities of facing sexual harassment in their everyday lives, with a shocking 90% of 13 to 21 year olds agreeing that schools should do more to address sexual harassment in classrooms. \"We've heard from girls who tell us you don't leave school as a girl without being called a slut, that to wear shorts under your skirt to prevent boys revealing your underwear in the playground is just normal behavior,\" Sophie Bennett, co-director of \"We've heard from girls who tell us you don't leave school as a girl without being called a slut, that to wear shorts under your skirt to prevent boys revealing your underwear in the playground is just normal behavior,\" Sophie Bennett, co-director of U.K. Feminista , an organization that campaigns for gender equality, told the committee. \"There is that sense of a normalized culture of sexual harassment in schools where girls don't feel able to report it and instead change their own behavior, such as wearing shorts under their skirts.\" This echoes the response the Women and Equalities Committee received in April, when it This echoes the response the Women and Equalities Committee received in April, when it spoke with 300 \"young people\" in the U.K., prior to launching its official investigation, in order to gauge how people in that demographic felt about the issue of sexual assault in schools, the Huffington Post reports. Back then, those surveyed told the committee that officials and teachers were not only dismissing incidents of harassment that were brought to their attention, but they were also downplaying the pressures of bullying that students can face. In turn, survivors feared being reprimanded for coming forward, according to the report. The committee agreed that sexual harassment is indeed an issue students face every day in school and that those in positions of power (i.e., principals or teachers) don't necessarily know how to recognize and address it. Susie McDonald, chief executive officer of Susie McDonald, chief executive officer of Tender , a U.K. charity devoted to anti-abuse, explained to the Committee that despite a \"seismic shift\" towards teachers feeling emboldened enough to report harassment, there still exists a \"fear that if they're reporting sexual violence, what it will do to their reputation and how it will impact Ofsted checks.\" (The latter is an organization that helps regulate the quality and care of students in schools.) A representative for Ofsted told the BBC that it takes into account how a school's leadership address concerns of harassment as part of its inspections. McDonald added that after talking to a group of female students in London about how to combat harassment, she felt that allowing girls to wear pants is a nice idea, but it won't actually put any emphasis on changing boys' attitudes towards their classmates. The issue of whether skirts are \"distracting\" to male peers has been a hot topic as of late.

Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report\u2019s authors warn. Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called \u2018superbugs\u2019 such as MRSA develop. Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further.

The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK. Lord O'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (PA) It calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: \"to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.\" Among his recommendations, Lord O\u2019Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use. The report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050. Antibiotics crisis is global Lord O\u2019Neill said of the findings: \"My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I\u2019m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now... to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.\" Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report\u2019s recommendations, saying: \"Lord O\u2019Neill\u2019s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. It is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. Apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate.\" Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an \"apocalyptic scenario\" over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as \"challenging.\" Antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections. They transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis. An estimated 40 million antibiotics are prescribed in the UK every year, of which the health regulator Nice claims 10 million are unnecessary prescriptions.", "Cows, for one. The Cato Institute has published a study that determines the likelihood of being killed by foreign-born terrorists. As you can see, there have been only three deaths in the US in the last 40 years attributed to terrorists who entered country as refugees. That\u2019s an average of 0.075 deaths per year, or a 1 in (roughly) 3.6 billion chance. As the study\u2019s author Alex Nowrasteh notes, these three deaths happened when Cuban refugees carried out an attack in the 1970s. The Refugee Act of 1980 strengthened refugee vetting, and not a single terrorism-related death since has been linked to refugees. So here\u2019s a short list of things that are more likely to kill you than a refugee if you live in the United States: 1. Cows According to the CDC, cows caused at least 108 deaths just between 2003\u20132007. That\u2019s about 21 deaths per year, roughly 288 times more than refugees. 2. Stairs According to the National Safety Council, injuries sustained from falling down stairs accounted for 1,307 deaths in the year 2000. That\u2019s a 1 in 2,739 chance over one\u2019s lifetime. 3. Hot tap water According to the Journal of Burn Care and Research, an average of 100 people die each year from burns caused by hot tap water. 4. Dogs The CDC found that 279 people died from dog bites between 1979 and 1994, which comes out to an average of about 18 people per year. 5. Vending machines According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, vending machines caused 37 deaths over a 17-year span. That\u2019s an average of only about two deaths per year, but it\u2019s still nearly 30 times more likely than dying at the hands of a \"refugee terrorist.\" 6. Bees Roughly 100 people die every year due to bee stings, according to the CDC. 7. Cell phones An average of eight people die per DAY due to traffic accidents as a result of texting a driving. That\u2019s 2,920 people per year. 8. Swing sets Swing sets cause an average of 20 deaths annually in the U.S., according to the CPSC. 9. Wind There were 76 wind-related deaths in 2011, and 104 in 2012. 10. Football In 2014, there were 16 deaths (six direct, the rest indirect) related to high school and college football, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research. Over a 20-year period from 1990 to 2010, a total of 243 football-related deaths were recorded. 11. Roller coasters According to data from the National Institute of Health, an average of four people die every year due to injuries caused by roller coasters. 12. Lawnmowers The CDC reports a total of 951 lawnmower-related deaths between 1999 and 2014, or roughly 63 per year. 13. Your bed NSC statistics show that 357 people died from accidental suffocation or strangulation in bed in the year 2000. So not only is that way, way more than the average of 0.075 deaths per year caused by refugees, but it also means you\u2019re actually four times more likely to be suffocated by your own bed than to be killed by a foreign-born terrorist of ANY kind.", "WASHINGTON -- When your opponents' legislative style bears frequent comparison to the antics of angry toddlers, perhaps what's needed is a lead negotiator with a schoolteacher mentality and a knack for discipline. Democrats think they may have that in Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who so famously sticks to the script that reporters are tempted to call her boring. She happens to have started her career wrangling obstreperous children -- which turns out to have been excellent preparation for the details-oriented approach that Murray has adopted in politics and that she intends to bring to the high-stakes budget negotiations that began last week with Republicans and continue Wednesday. \"I taught preschool,\" Murray told The Huffington Post in an interview in her Capitol Hill office this week. \"You don't walk into a class with 4-year-olds without a direction of where you're going to go.\" Murray most certainly has a plan for the budget conference with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). It boils down to offering various compromises and seeing if Republicans are willing to bite after their disastrous, poll-punished bid to defund Obamacare by shutting down the government. \"I look at this as the Republican opportunity to stand up and show there can be adults in their party and help our country find compromise and move us forward as a country,\" Murray said. \"If they opt not to do that, and this budget conference ends up in the same place with no resolution, I think it's going to hurt them in the long run. I think there are more of them that see that, and I'm hopeful they stand up.\" The conference committee aims to find ways to replace the sequestration budget cuts that Congress' last failed negotiations left, and to hash out ways to fund the government after the current stopgap bill expires Jan. 15 and to raise the debt ceiling after Feb. 7. To get there, Murray is offering a menu of items that Democrats don't like, but have been willing to swallow, if Ryan and company will compromise. Among the proposals are some $350 billion in entitlement cuts spelled out in the budget the Senate passed in March. Her iron rule is that Republicans get nothing if they are not willing to give something in the way of raising revenue. And replacing the sequester cannot mean simply boosting defense and cutting domestic programs. \"First of all, it's going to be defense and non-defense. There's going to be revenue that is part of the package, and then if there's revenue, that will kind of outline what we're willing to give in terms of spending cuts,\" Murray said. \"We're not going to cut Medicare and impact benefits for seniors to replace defense cuts,\" she added. \"I don't think the country would back that. We are going to look and are willing to look at a series of things that we can do on the cutting side.\" She said cuts wouldn't include yoking Social Security payments to so-called chained CPI -- changing the way inflation is measured so that benefits grow more slowly than under the current inflation index. Ryan offered no concessions when he sat down next to Murray for the first conference committee meeting, saying Democrats had better forget about trying to raise revenue as part of the solution to America's debt problems. \"I want to say this from the get-go: If this conference becomes an argument about taxes, we\u2019re not going to get anywhere,\" said Ryan. He exuded a certain type of charm and confidence as he opened the talks, appearing unchastened by the government shutdown debacle. \"You\u2019ll notice there are three senators for every congressman -- so as we see it, that's an even match,\" Ryan joked. \"I like to think quality beats quantity.\" Murray stuck to her script and made no jokes when it was her turn to speak. But the diminutive grandmother, somewhat dwarfed by the former vice presidential nominee, likely agreed with his quip -- at least the part about brains trumping bulk. And she thinks the smart thing for Republicans to do is, well, stop being babies. \"I think the Republicans have to sit back and say, 'Do we want to be part of that governing party system and compromise system, or do we want to be the group in the corner that yells and screams?' \" Murray said. \"That's what caused the government shutdown, the -- I'm sorry, I used to teach preschool -- the temper tantrum on the floor, to show how somehow they are powerful.\" The question of power is an interesting one for Murray. She cuts such an unassuming figure that it's easy to underestimate her. But she comes off a 2012 election cycle in which she shepherded the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to improbable wins. She's also the fourth-ranking member of the Senate leadership, making her arguably the most powerful elected woman in politics. And in the context of budget talks, she's almost a direct extension of Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Aides, who spoke anonymously because they did not have permission to talk about the personal relationship, said Murray has near-carte blanche from Reid because they are on the same page philosophically about the budget. \"When they talk about this stuff, they finish each other's sentences,\" one aide said. That authority was on display in the late days of the government shutdown, when Democrats showed signs of caving. A plan introduced by Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) was gathering steam among red state Democrats and eventually won the backing of seven Democrats. The plan was built on the premise that for Republicans, it was a concession to reopen the government and raise the borrowing cap. It asked Democrats to accept a two-year delay of Obamacare's medical device tax, and to lock in sequester cuts for six months. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) threw his support behind the plan, but on the Saturday before the shutdown ended -- a critical day of negotiations -- Murray shut it down. A Democratic leadership aide said that during a closed-door meeting, Murray beseeched her colleagues not to force the country into six more months of meat-ax sequester cuts. Such a move would also weaken her hand in upcoming budget negotiations, she argued. Democrats emerging from that meeting said her plea won the day. \"Patty Murray makes a very important point,\" Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said after the meeting. \"If she is bound going into a budget conference by the Paul Ryan number, where is her bargaining power? Some Senate Republicans were insisting on that. But that\u2019s unfair.\" Murray marched over to Collins on the Senate floor to deliver the answer herself. \"It was cordial. It wasn't heated, though it may have been animated,\" a leadership aide said. Collins declined to comment on the exchange but said she has a \"terrific relationship\" with Murray, whom she characterized as both a colleague and a friend. \"I have nothing but good things to say about her,\" Collins told HuffPost. \"She's strong, she works very hard, she's no-nonsense, down-to-earth and she knows how to bring people together and get the job done.\" And that's where she sees herself as she and Ryan head for their next meeting, Nov. 13, a month before their deadline to produce an agreement. \"The country has had enough of the temper tantrums and the non-compromise,\" Murray said, \"People believe strongly in things, and they expect us to come back here and fight for things, but they also get that a legislative democracy works by people coming together.\" Whatever the talk, few observers expect the conference committee to produce a deal. But with Murray as the calm, reasonable-seeming face of the Democratic position, the stakes may actually be higher for the GOP, whatever Ryan's smarmy opening joke may have suggested. \"I think there are a lot of people praying that we do our jobs, which is compromise,\" Murray said. \"If the Republicans choose not to and say no revenue, not a dime, nothing, I think that they will feel the backlash and I think many of them will realize that.\" And while she said she believes Republicans would again pay the price for another showdown, Murray insisted she'd prefer a deal. \"I'm a Democrat. I want Democrats to be in the majority, I want to us to be the party that sets the priorities -- I'm all for that,\" she said. \"But we also need a strong Republican Party of good people, who come here, who passionately care for things but are also willing to sit down and compromise. That's what makes a democracy work.\"", "Netflix original \"BoJack Horseman\" Season 4 continues from a strongly received S3, which owes much from efforts by creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg and his team to find different ways to tell their series stories. Certainly fans of the Netflix series enthusiastically heap praises on \"BoJack Horseman\" precisely for the storytelling on the journey of \"Horsin' Around\" star Bojack (Will Arnett). Observer cites Raphael Bob-Waksberg in highlighting that with each season of \"BoJack Horseman\" the Netflix series expands the boundaries of its creativity. Fans of the Netflix series are, by now, familiar with how \"BoJack Horseman\" unafraidly shifts perspectives, modes and styles of storytelling. what do you do once you've burnt every bridge and lost every friendship. where do you go? asking for a friend. \u2014 BoJack Horseman (@BoJackHorseman) September 23, 2016 \"Fish Out Of Water\" from \"BoJack Horseman\" Season 3, for example, is one of the strongest favorites among fans of the Netflix series. For the most part, \"Fish Out Of Water\" effectively and wordlessly told the story of the disintegrated relationships between BoJack Horseman and his friends and loved ones. the key to happiness is not bothering famous celebrities in public. please remind everyone. \u2014 BoJack Horseman (@BoJackHorseman) September 21, 2016 Interestingly, despite the fantastic approach of using an anthropomorphic character as lead in \"BoJack Horseman,\" realism and empathy are among the most lauded aspects of the Netflix series. Observer cites actress Mara Wilson, for example, on the former child actress' praise for the accuracy by which \"BoJack Horseman\" portrayed the life of celebrities in Hollywood. Parent Herald cites an interview on The Frame at SCPR with Raphael Bob-Waksberg on how \"BoJack Horseman\" Season 3 grappled with how people tend to chase after fleeting happiness. Conversely, \"BoJack Horseman\" Season 3 explored how despite the fact that certain things in life are fleeting, one should rightly retain an attitude of hope. To be sure, Raphael Bob-Waksberg and his team create something more than meets the eye with \"BoJack Horseman.\" While the easiest assessment of \"BoJack Horseman\" is a cynical satire of a show, the Netflix series is, in fact, a cleverly presented trove of wisdom on excellence. \"BoJack Horseman\" Season 4 is anticipated to be released by Netflix in the summer of 2017. What issues do you hope to see tackled in \"BoJack Horseman\" Season 4?", "By this point in 1984, \"Star Wars\" was pretty much dead. George Lucas was still talking about the prequels, but he made it clear that they wouldn\u2019t be released anytime soon. (Lucas, at one point, said that he wanted to take two years off, then start production on \"Episode I,\" with an eventual release date of 1988. \"Episode I\" was finally released in 1999.) Children of that era (ahem) were already so scattershot with their attention spans, that they had moved on to G.I. Joe and Transformers for entertainment. By 1985, \"Power of the Force\"-labeled \"Star Wars\" action figures warmed retail-store pegs. (Which, today, are some of the most valuable because absolutely nobody bought them at the time.) Nineteen Eighty-Four marked what would become the death throes for action-adventure movies set in space. There had been a flood of lesser movies trying to capitalize on the tone set by the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy: there was \"Krull,\" \"The Last Starfighter,\" \"Megaforce,\" and even a little-known gem that tried to capitalize on both \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" titled, of course, \"Space Raiders.\" And, front and center, waving its space herpes-infected death rattle, was \"The Ice Pirates,\" which turns 30 years old on Sunday. \"The Ice Pirates\" remains a bit of an anomaly today. In an age of unabashed nostalgia for anything, \"The Ice Pirates\" is largely unmentioned and unloved. Which is odd because \"The Ice Pirates\" was extremely popular with the 9 year olds of 1984. (I speak from experience.) Before I re-watched \"The Ice Pirates\" this week, the only thing I really remembered was a machine that would slice off a person\u2019s scrotum with big chomping teeth (in fourth grade, this scene was discussed with an almost unhealthy resolve). Having now re-watched \"The Ice Pirates\" \u2013- and now being the same age that my father was when he took me to see \"The Ice Pirates\" \u2013- a lot of things about my relationship with my father, as it pertains to our personal tastes concerning popular culture, makes a lot more sense now. The first movie my parents ever took me to see in a theater was \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" The next year, in 1981, they took me to see a re-release of the original \"Star Wars.\" I know my father wasn\u2019t a particular fan of \"Star Wars,\" but he tolerated it because they are genuinely entertaining movies. It\u2019s when \"The Last Starfighter\" and \"The Ice Pirates\" came along -- movies that he, like so many others, thought were garbage -- that my father checked out. \"The Ice Pirates\" is a movie that only a 9-year-old could like \u2013- and that\u2019s why these types of movies died. (And, really, 9 year olds didn\u2019t like \"The Ice Pirates\" -\u2013 they just liked that it reminded them of \"Star Wars.\") In 1977, space movies were getting nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. By 1984, \"space movies\" were dumb. Like I said, I re-watched \"The Ice Pirates\" and, hoo boy, what a weird thing. The gist is a band of pirates \u2013- led by Robert Urich as Jason (doing his best Han Solo impression), along with fellow pirates that include Anjelica Huston and Ron Perlman \u2013- comb the galaxy looking for water. Okay! Not a bad premise! But Jason's pirates actually wear pirate costumes. And they have swords. Not laser swords, but just regular swords. In space. This movie is insane. Jason and his team wind up being captured, then they are strapped onto some sort of assembly line that leads them to the dreaded scrotum-chomp machine \u2013- you know, for kids -\u2013 before having to pretend they were castrated (they avoid the scrotum-chomp machine\u2019s wrath) at some sort of elaborate space debutante ball. Love scene dialogue includes gems like Jason saying, \"I should take my saber off.\" The princess (Mary Crosby) responds, \"Let me. You\u2019re so stiff. The belt, I mean.\" (This is such a perfect euphemism because, if belts are known for anything, it\u2019s being stiff?) \"The Ice Pirates\" ends with (I swear I am not making this up) an elaborate fight scene as their spaceship travels through a time warp. The time warp causes all of the characters to age so much that, during this fight, Jason\u2019s son is conceived, born, becomes an adult, and literally swoops in to save a now-elderly Jason. Oh, and Bruce Vilanch shows up. (I should take a moment to point out that the director of \"The Ice Pirates\" is Stewart Raffill, the same man who directed \"Mac and Me\" and has supplied Paul Rudd with a lifetime of talk-show movie clips. So, Raffill can take full credit for restoring the \"cute and nice alien\" movie trend, too.) The thing is, I don\u2019t think anyone involved in \"The Ice Pirates\" really took it that seriously in the first place. It\u2019s just bad timing that it came out when it did \u2013 followed by the slightly more serious, but still fun \"The Last Starfighter -- because there really was a real opportunity to create new action-adventure stories that were set in space. It just so happened that no one quite knew how to pounce on the opening left by \"Star Wars.\" (I am not forgetting the \"Star Trek\" movies, but those already had an established fan base before \"Star Wars\" and, with the exception of \"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,\" kind of lived in their own insular world.) That\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t sci-fi, but the space adventures in theaters seemed, for all purposes, dead. Now, television picked up the slack. So much, in fact -\u2013 with shows like \"Firefly\" and \"Battlestar Galactica -- that you may not even realize the dearth (other than the \"Star Wars\" prequels and \"Star Trek\" movies) that was levied upon the space opera. In the last year, things have changed dramatically. It\u2019s easy to point at \"Gravity\" as a turning point for these types of movies. And it certainly helps, but its action still occurs pretty close to Earth and -\u2013 as unbelievable as some scenes may actually be \u2013- it\u2019s still based in at least some sort of hyper-stylized version of reality. The real test is Marvel\u2019s \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\" Sort of. I mean, it is the very definition of the kind of action-adventure movie this entire piece has been about, but it\u2019s also a Marvel movie set in the current \"Iron Man,\" \"Thor,\" Captain America,\" \"Avengers\" timeline. So, even if a person were not normally going to see \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movie, they\u2019re probably going to think, Well, it\u2019s a sequel to \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" so I need to see it. It\u2019s a test, but the true test comes for whatever, if anything, tries to follow \"Guardians\" (not counting \"Star Wars: Episode VII\"). Whatever it is, let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s not a remake of \"The Ice Pirates\" ... I\u2019ve seen enough scrotum-chomp machines for a lifetime.", "This is the kind of infuriating news that we are going to be hearing more of as this \"gender identity bathroom use\" is allowed to continue.

Sure, sickos are going to be sickos whether legal or not. But such a stupid blanket law may as well give them the green light. At what point are we going to realize this? A transgender \u2018woman\u2019\u2019, James Goebel, was caught taking photos of teens girls using the restroom at a Dallas area Target store.

She ran out and told her father, who held the door shut until police arrived. When authorities arrived, they arrested 28 year old James Goebel and searched her phone for evidence. They found over 700 photos of young girls using the restroom, from dates ranging in the past 5 months. Dallas\u2019s local LGBT community has come together to stand in defense with Goebel, claiming she should not be persecuted because she was \"born a pedophile and therefore can not change her sexual orientation\". This comment comes from the leader of Dallas\u2019s LGBT Aqua Squad, Dorothy Wright. So now the Dallas LGBT Aqua Squad is pushing to include pedophilia as a sexual orientation?!

We can\u2019t stand by and continue to let truth be twisted. It\u2019s time to rise up in prayer and hope because darkness doesn\u2019t win.", "A new study suggests that middle and high school students are eating more fruits and vegetables, exercising more, skipping breakfast less often and eating fewer sweets. At the same time, childhood obesity rates appear to have leveled off for the first time in years. \"It was a bit of a surprise,\" said study coauthor Ronald Iannotti, a professor of exercise and health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Boston and a researcher with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. \"Over the last few decades -- the last five, really -- obesity has increased in U.S. adolescents and become a real epidemic.\" But the new findings, which were published online in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, suggest that between 2001 and 2009 there was a \"cresting,\" he said. Researchers surveyed more than 9,000 students, in grades six through 10, about their health behaviors as well as their body mass index -- a measure of weight relative to height. During evaluations in 2001-2002, 14.9 percent of the students were considered overweight based on their BMIs, while 10.3 percent were considered obese. By 2005-2006, that had jumped to 17 percent and nearly 13 percent, respectively, but then appeared to level off. Researchers found in 2009-2010, that the percent of children considered obese dipped slightly. Additionally, during the course of the study the number of students who reported eating fruits and vegetables daily increased, as did the number who said they regularly ate breakfast, which in studies has been linked to lower weight and healthier cholesterol levels. The amount of physical activity they got increased during the study period, and the time spent watching TV decreased, although the amount of video game-playing and chatting online remained largely the same. However, the new research does not establish a clear cause-and-effect between the apparent uptick in healthy behavior and leveling off in obesity among adolescents. \"Since we were just taking samples of kids at three points in time, we can't say one is causing the other,\" said Iannotti. However, he said the significant attention in recent years to the health implications associated with obesity has increased parental awareness and may explain why children seem to be leading healthier lives. Other experts are less optimistic. \"Even if obesity rates have stabilized, they're still unacceptably high,\" said Sara Bleich, an associate professor researching the escalation of obesity and its related diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"We're looking at 18 percent in the pediatric population -- almost 1 in 5 kids -- and among minority kids, it's even higher.\" An American Heart Association study published last week found that 5 percent of children in the United States are now considered \"severely obese,\" which is defined as having a BMI at least 20 percent higher than 95 percent of children of the same gender in their age group. And though the number of those with healthier habits appears to have increased, or at least remained largely stable during the study period, the overall rates were still low; most did not do an hour or more a day of moderate exercise, or eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. But at this point, with obesity rates as high as they are, any good news -- however minor -- should be considered welcome news, Iannotti argued. \"We're bending the curve. We're starting to reduce that increase [in obesity],\" he said. \"That's good news.\"", "A South Florida single of mom of 10 was expecting to get a free turkey as she waited in line at an annual holiday turkey giveaway on Monday; what she got instead was something that will make a difference all year long -- a shiny new SUV.

The study only looked at metropolitan areas with more than 1 million people and took into consideration factors such as the percentage of married couples in the city, the divorce rate, the average credit score and the average number of hours worked per week. In May 2013, Rent.com released their list of the best cities for newlyweds with Tulsa, Okla. coming out on top.

People magazine hammered that home on Tuesday when it published the names of six witnesses who said they were told some version of former People reporter Natasha Stoynoff\u2019s charge that in the middle of an interview, Trump pushed her up against a wall, \"forcing his tongue down my throat.\" At least one of these witnesses was told of the event the very day it happened, and others were told that same week. Some of the witnesses also validated Stoynoff\u2019s claim that she didn\u2019t come forward at the time of the incident, in 2005, because she feared retaliation. Since her story came out, Trump has said she is lying and suggested that she was too ugly for him to assault. Stoynoff\u2019s college friend Liza Herz says she was with Stoynoff when they bumped into Melania Trump the winter after the incident. \"What struck me most was that Melania was carrying a child and wearing heels,\" she recalls of the encounter, which Trump\u2019s wife denies took place. Stoynoff\u2019s friend of 25 years Marina Grasic says she was given a detailed account of the incident the day after it happened and that Stoynoff feared retaliation. \"She was particularly concerned that if he was capable of such behavior, what else was he capable of?\" she said. \"Certainly character assassination by a powerful man was of great concern to her, which seems warranted in light of what Trump is saying about her this week. She ultimately decided to stay quiet but be taken off the Trump beat.\" Stoynoff\u2019s journalism professor, Paul McLaughlin, says she called him up in tears the night of the incident and that he advised her not to come forward. \"She wasn\u2019t sure what she should do,\" McLaughlin said. \"I advised her not to say anything, because I believed Trump would deny it and try to destroy her.\" People East Coast Editor Liz McNeil said she was told of the incident after Stoynoff returned from the Florida interview with Trump. \"She was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall,\" said McNeil. \"The thing I remember most was how scared she was. I felt I had to protect her.\" Deputy East Coast News Editor Mary Green was told about it later, she said. \"In an early conversation we had in her office, she told me about what happened with Donald Trump,\" Green said. \"She was shaky, sitting at her desk, relaying that, \u2018He took me to this other room, and when we stepped inside, he pushed me against a wall and stuck his tongue down my throat. Melania was upstairs and could have walked in at any time.\u2019 \" Finally, Liza Hamm, a correspondent at People, recalled being told the story. \"Natasha has always been a vivacious person who wants to believe in the best of people, and this experience definitely messed with that outlook,\" Hamm said.", "Mike is ViralNova's resident Editor of the Weird.

That goes double if you're talking about surprises of the morbid variety, but that's exactly what you'll see if you ever fly into the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport in Savannah, Georgia. Thanks to a decision by the military during World War II, one of the runways serves as a makeshift graveyard. If you have a keen eye and you're flying in on runway 10, you'll notice two concrete slabs that don't look like they belong there. Here's a close-up, courtesy of Google Maps. What you're actually seeing here are two concrete grave markers. Before there was an airport, the land belonged to the Dotson family. As it was part of their homestead, the property also included a family cemetery with at least a dozen (and possibly up to 100) graves. During World War II, the military took over what was once a small airport and expanded many of its runways. One of those extensions reached to where the family cemetery was located. The military needed to pave over the cemetery to create an east-west runway. Most of the bodies were unearthed and moved to different cemeteries, except for those of John, Catherine, and Richard Dotson, as well as the corpse of a man named Daniel Hueston. To commemorate them, two concrete slabs were embedded into the pavement. (via Consumerist) Well, it looks like my morbid curiosity is taking me to Georgia next!

Trump.\" The basis for Trump\u2019s impeachment, according to local ABC News affiliate KGO, would be the president\u2019s alleged links to his private business holdings. Critics have claimed that these create conflicts of interest, and possibly violate the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause. However, there is no evidence that Trump has benefited from conflicts of interest, or that he has done anything illegal to justify the \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" standard for impeachment. The Emoluments Clause argument is also thought by many constitutional scholars and legal analysts to be very weak. Donald Trump has been something of an obsession for Richmond politicians. In 2015, the mayor blamed Trump for inciting a hate crime against a local mosque, even though the suspect had praised Hillary Clinton in social media. Richmond is the sixth-poorest large city in the state, and has the highest public employee salary burden, according to a nonpartisan report issued last year.

We\u2019re seeing a tremendous amount of positive change. The basis is there.

Paramount Pictures will release the film on July 28.", "People are spending so much time journeying around looking for Pokemon that getting sore legs from playing for hours on end has practically become its own meme Smart businesses have caught on too. As Pokemon Go users traverse their towns in search of Pokemon, local stores, restaurants, movie theaters, and other businesses are capitalizing on this massive opportunity, driving huge amounts of foot traffic and conversions both with simple in-app purchases and creative marketing campaigns. To start turning the ambulating gamers around you into your new best customers, all you need is to know how to play the game. Here's how: 1. Find Out if Your Business Is a Gym or PokeStop What makes Pokemon Go different from many other games is that it doesn't keep people shut up in their rooms. The game runs off an augmented reality HUD, or heads-up display, of the real world. Players' avatars explore with them as they catch Pokemon, collect rewards from PokeStops, battle other users at Gyms, and team up to defend their territory. Figuring out whether your business is a PokeStop or Gym is the first thing you should do. PokeStops and Gyms attract foot traffic without any effort-players flock to them for rewards and to battle other players-and they can be leveraged for massive sales if you know how. There is no official Niantic map that lists all the PokeStop and Gym locations yet. One workaround is to use the online map of portals created over the last three years for the game \"Ingress,\" also developed by Niantic, which maps virtually 1:1 with Pokemon Go's PokeStops and Gyms. Check out the map here after you install the Ingress app on your phone and sign in (you can use a Google account, and it only takes about a minute to set up). Once you have it set up, you'll be treated to a searchable world map of different \"portals\"-each one being either a PokeStop or a Gym in Pokemon Go. 2. Sit Back, Throw Down a Lure, and Enjoy the Show Pokemon Go offers a range of in-app purchases. The one that is most important for your small business is Lures. Lures increase the rate of Pokemon generation in the area around the PokeStop where they're placed for one half hour. That may not sound that powerful, but Pokemon are scarcer than you think . Luring is an insanely powerful tool that you really have to see to believe. Here's a sample of the comments from some recent Reddit threads on the subject We did this last night (college town), and within minutes of dropping the lure, 30 people walked in. Hoooly s#&@. I own a pizzeria that's a Pokestop and I literally did this all day. I had a ton of kids and adults (mostly adults) come in for a slice of pizza and a drink until the lure ran out. What's even more incredible is just how affordable luring is. Let's do the math. With $100 netting you 14,500 Pokecoins and an eight-pack of Lures costing 680 Pokecoins: 14,500 Pokecoins / 680 = 21 eight-packs of lures (21 * 8)/2 = 84 hours $100/84 hours = $1.19 per hour All you have to do is: Tap the red Pokeball at the bottom of your HUD Tap \"Shop\" Scroll down and tap the purple, box-shaped Lures to purchase. You'll re-direct to your app store's payment system Once back in-app, tap the red Pokeball again, then tap \"Items\" Tap the purple Lure to activate! For a little more than a dollar an hour, you can bring virtually guaranteed crowds to your business. The ROI here is ridiculous, so if your business is anywhere near a PokeStop, this is something you absolutely have to try. Capitalize on Your Business Being Near a Pokemon Gym Gyms are a separate kind of animal entirely from PokeStops. You can't put down Lures, but you don't have to either, because users are converging on Gyms day and night to face off with other users and \"take control\" of the gym for either team Mystic, Valor, or Instinct. To see if your business is near a gym, you can check the Ingress map , or just open Pokemon Go on your phone and look for the tall structures with little Pokemon near the top. They're not hard to spot-they're the biggest structures on the in-game map. Capitalizing on your proximity to a gym is more about creative marketing in real life than anything else. Here are some ideas for ways to engage with the droves of people standing near your business with their eyes glued to their phones: Giveaways: Order Pokemon Gym badges from a supplier that can customize them for your business. A quick Google search of the keywords \"Pokemon Gym badge\" and \"custom\" should get you what you need. Order Pokemon Gym badges from a supplier that can customize them for your business. A quick Google search of the keywords \"Pokemon Gym badge\" and \"custom\" should get you what you need. Keep score: Put up a sandwich board announcing which team is currently in control of your Gym, and then offer a discount to members of that team! Don't worry about staying updated on which team is winning-just ask those who are participating in the promotion to inform you when the gym has changed hands. Put up a sandwich board announcing which team is currently in control of your Gym, and then offer a discount to members of that team! Don't worry about staying updated on which team is winning-just ask those who are participating in the promotion to inform you when the gym has changed hands. Get social: Take in-game screenshots and post them on the social-media platforms where you're active. Use hashtags like #pokemongo and #pokemon to get the message out to your potential new customers. If you're nowhere near either a PokeStop or a Gym, that just means you have to get a little more creative. 3. Go Where the Pokemon Roam Once you know the basics of how Pokemon Go works, you don't actually need to be near a PokeStop or a Gym to capitalize on the traffic they can create. Take Your Business on the Road One way to make your business a part of the Pokemon Go phenomenon is to get mobile and find a spot from which to orchestrate the Lure or Gym strategies. If you're a fashion retailer, maybe this means loading up a van with some of your latest vintage finds. If you're a restaurant, maybe this means going to the park and setting up a barbecue. It's summertime, so get creative. Since Pokemon are everywhere, you want to go where you have the best chance of finding success. Take advantage of places where you have clusters of PokeStops. If there are three PokeStops on the same block, as is happening fairly often in larger cities, then park yourself in the middle of them and lay down three Lures at the same time. It's the same effect as if you were laying down one-just multiplied by three. Before you know it, you'll have a serious crowd on your hands. Promote Your Local Pokemon on Social Media Even if your business is nowhere near a PokeStop or a Gym, you're still going to have Pokemon. One way to get people excited about visiting your business is to get on social media and show off the valuable or rare Pokemon popping up in your area. To know what to look for, a Reddit user has created a handy rarity chart You could hire a member of your staff to sit on Pokemon Go all day, lay down Incense (an in-game purchase similar to a Lure, but which only gives effects to the person who triggered it), and take screenshots of the Pokemon they capture. A better option, though, might be to incentivize play on the part of your customers. Consider running it like a referral program Tell users you'll pay for their Incense in return for some screenshots of any rare Pokemon that pop up in the vicinity of your shop. Have them upload the picture and tag you on social media, so that their followers know about you too. Promote the fact that you're rewarding users who find rare Pokemon at your business. Do this right, and you could turn your store into a viral destination. Advertise Your Pokemon on Facebook If you don't already have a decent-sized following on social media, or if you're looking to drive an even greater amount of traffic, then Facebook advertising is your best bet. By creating a Facebook ad targeted only inside the geographical radius of your choice , you could spread the word about your local Pokemon only to those people liable to actually stop into your store. The vanilla Facebook advertising interface can be hard to use, so check out one of the Facebook ad managers out there if you want help. AdEspresso , one such tool, makes it easy to set whatever targeting criteria you want, whether that's geographic (one mile around your business), demographic (ages 16 to 26), or interest-based (they \"like\" Pokemon Go on Facebook). Pokemon Go and Start Marketing Your Local Business Right Now The naysayers inside your organization will say the same things people say whenever there's a big paradigm shift. \"This is a fad,\" they'll say. And that could be true. People, of course, said the same thing about the original Pokemon game. The more salient point here is that no marketing channel is evergreen, but businesses that want to win have to keep one eye open for these big shifts-and they have to capitalize on them when it's time. With Pokemon Go, businesses have an unprecedented opportunity to create strong emotional bonds with new customers, and for very little money. Even if Pokemon Go isn't as powerful a tool for driving sales six months or a year from now, the customers that you delight today are going to remember you tomorrow.", "First lady Melania Trump wore a stunning, off-the-shoulder gown that she co-created with French designer Herve\u0301 Pierre, to the inaugural balls. With the considerable press about various designers refusing to outfit the new first lady, the glamorous custom ivory gown was the subject of much media attention. Pierre, though, thoroughly supports the first lady and, as he revealed in his first interview since Jan. 21, he\u2019s also incredibly grateful for the opportunity. Additionally, working with her has seemed to only help his career. \"I had no idea when I made the dress what the consequences would be,\" Pierre told Bazaar.com on his newfound celeb status. \"Immediately my phone went completely ballistic with interview requests; I had investors and bankers in Dubai calling, people opened fake Instagram accounts under my name. Even Target called to say, \u2018We are so excited you are doing a line for us.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, I had no idea I was doing one.\u2019 The attention is something I\u2019m not used to.\" Originally approached by Melania Trump to be her stylist for the event, the first lady then asked the designer to create the dress with her help after seeing a number of his sketches, according to Bazaar.com. Throughout the design process, Pierre shared that the incoming first lady was intent on making a dress that was completely her own. \"She was very specific about the neckline, about all the lines being parallel. It was important for us not to follow any recipe for a \u2018first lady gown.'\" Melania was even particular about the small details, with Pierre sharing that she once told him, \"Herve\u0301, I love you, but I cannot move my arm to hold my husband\u2019s arm when we dance.\" This outspoken attitude during the design process helped Pierre better understand what the first lady was looking for, he said. \"As a man designing for a woman, you put into the clothing your ideals, what you idolize, but a woman will put you back on track and say, \u2018I cannot reach my fork,\u2019\" he said. Pierre has nothing but positive feedback to report about his time dressing the first lady, sharing that she already possesses a deep understanding of the fashion industry. \"She knows fashion \u2014 she was a model and has worked in a design studio \u2014 so she knows about construction,\" he said. \"When I brought her fabric swatches, she immediately picked the heaviest, most beautiful six-ply silk from Italy. She knows about fabrics. It was a very organic conversation, because we have the same vocabulary.\" The former creative director at Carolina Herrera has worked with the first lady in the past. In fact, he has fond memories of helping her find pieces during his time at the fashion house. \"I remember when she used to come to the Herrera offices \u2014 when she was pleased with the clothes, she would scream with happiness,\" he shared. When questioned about how he would respond to the designers who voiced their disinterest in dressing the first lady, Pierre offered a thoughtful response. \"That\u2019s the good thing about this country: we are all equal, but we are definitely not the same,\" he told Bazaar.com. \"I\u2019m not doing politics, I\u2019m doing dresses. We are not suddenly brokering a big deal between China and Russia. If people don\u2019t want to dress her, I think it\u2019s sad, but I was honored. I don\u2019t criticize these people \u2014 it\u2019s their choice, and that\u2019s the beauty of democracy.\" Pierre does plan and hope to work with the first lady in the future. As for his predictions for Melania\u2019s fashions in the White House? \"There is an economy of the drawing, and that\u2019s who she is,\" he said. \"Her next four years as first lady are going to be \u2014 like this gown \u2014 straight to the point, perhaps with a single, measured detail.\"", "How To Spectate in Overwatch We all know you prefer to watch than to actually play Overwatch. Here's how you can spectate in Overwatch. As fun as it is to play Overwatch, sometimes players would prefer to kick back and watch their friends, streamers, or eSports figure in order to learn some new tricks, or just be amazed at what can be done in the game. Unfortunately, Blizzard doesn\u2019t make it easy to spectate someone else\u2019s game, so we\u2019re here to give you some tips on how you can watch others play Overwatch. I Like To Watch Considering it\u2019s an online multiplayer game, it\u2019s surprising to see at its launch lacks a dedicated spectator mode. But Blizzard does make it possible to spectate in Overwatch, although it isn\u2019t as convenient as a dedicated spectator mode. One way to spectate a game is to attempt to join a game a friend is currently playing. If the game is full, you\u2019ll be forced to sit on the sidelines, but as a result, you can spectate your friend as well as all of the other players in the match. If your friend continues with the same group into another match, and there\u2019s no vacancies, you\u2019ll continue to sit in the new game as a spectator. Another way to spectate a game is by joining a new game yourself which also has all team spots filled. When this happens, you\u2019ll be forced to enter spectator mode, although as soon as a spot frees up, you\u2019ll be thrown into the action. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to back out of the game to re-enter spectator mode. I\u2019ve Got My Eye On You As we mentioned, Overwatch currently doesn\u2019t have a spectator mode, but that doesn\u2019t mean Blizzard won\u2019t consider adding it some time during the game\u2019s post launch. We\u2019ve seen several Blizzard games launch without a dedicated spectator mode, to then have one added months later. So for now, it appears the only way to spectate any matches are the two ways we mentioned above. Need more help with Overwatch?

Qloo says it has \"mapped the taste genome\" by combing through massive amounts of data. Then, it spits out answers to burning questions from brands and advertisers about the preferences of their target audiences when it comes to things like food, music and TV. For instance, as TechCrunch reports , Qloo can tell you the favorite music artists of fans of the Golden State Warriors vs. fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers. That's no small thing: it helps advertisers ensure they're marketing the right things to both groups, collectively or separately, based on what they do and don't share. (For instance, Warriors fans like Drake and Cavs fans like Li'l Wayne, but both groups like pizza and SportsCenter.)

Now that we're in the era of \"Facebook official\" and selfie statuses, it's pretty clear that the comfort we take in being able to definitively label our relationships \u2014 something which can often feel so uncertain and be communicated poorly. Now, it's becoming increasingly common to frequently post about your relationship (and life). If it's not online, you don't have proof that it happened. If you think of social media as the modern equivalent of a town square, the place where announcements are made and information is posted and communities are bonded over shared experiences, then it only makes sense that you'd be inclined to share the bits and pieces of your life that you perceive to be worthy of documenting. The point is to post the highlight reel. The concept is to share the parts of our lives that those who aren't immediately close to us otherwise wouldn't be able to see \u2014 and there is nothing wrong with this. Yet social media has an added layer of nuance, as it is a supplement (if not a projection) of our identity, connectedness, and self-worth. We can piece together an image of ourselves, quantify how loved and seen we are by others, and ultimately begin to gauge and compare where we stand socially. It should come as no surprise that we end up addicted to the thrill that all the clicks and pixels give us, as those things that social media represents \u2014 personhood, connection, inherent worth \u2014 are struggles that are very deeply embedded in the human condition. If you want to know how someone wants the world to see them, look no further than the patterns in their social media feeds. This is never more true (or interesting, to be honest) than when it comes to their most intimate relationships. While it's normal and even healthy to be proud and public about who you're dating, there is at the same time a clear connection between how genuinely content you are with your relationship and how often you post about it. Here a few reasons for this. You can make yourself feel better about a part of your life simply by thinking that other people see it differently In other words, if we aren't getting a \"high\" from the parts of our lives that we think are supposed to account for our emotional contentment, we seek that feeling elsewhere. Most commonly, this comes from how we think other people perceive the situation to be. (TL;DR: If we can convince ourselves that other people see our relationships happily, we feel happier about them, as we're subconsciously shifting our point of view.) When you're happy with your life (or a relationship) you're naturally more present for it It occurs to you less to take photos or check your social media feeds. It's not that you never do those things, but that your life is making you so happy, so why would you want to be distracted by it? Any couple that keeps their intimate arguments or struggles offline is always better off On the flip side of oversharing is going public with posting the things you're not so happy about. But no matter what the context, an issue has never been resolved well after someone aired the dirty laundry for all of their Facebook friends (and family) to see. Their relationship validates them, so they don't need to seek that feeling externally In other words, there seems to be little appeal in constantly writing updates about the relationship. Their joy is in being together, not in posting about being together. They don't have anything to prove They are not using one another to prove to the world that they are happy and lovable and worthy and attractive. They're together because they want to be, not because their deep-seated issues want them to be.", "\ue6b3 \ue6b4 HBO has already hinted we\u2019re nearing the end of Game of Thrones, and now showrunners David Benioff and D.B.

Benioff expanded on why they\u2019re so adamant about sticking to the 70-75 hour mark: We\u2019re trying to tell one cohesive story with a beginning, middle and end. We\u2019ve known the end for quite some time and we\u2019re hurtling toward it. Those last images from the show that aired on Sunday] showed that. Daenerys is finally coming back to Westeros; Jon Snow is king of the North and Cersei is sitting on the Iron Throne. And we know the Night King is up there, waiting for all of them. The pieces are on the board now. Some of the pieces have been removed from the board and we are heading toward the end game. According to Benioff, Game of Thrones was always pitched as a show with an end, not something that was going to go on and on. We wanted it to be one giant story, without padding it out to add an extra 10 hours, or because people are still watching it. We wanted something where, if people watched it end to end, it would make sense as one continuous story. HBO has aired 60 episodes so far, which means we can expect 15 more at the most, 10 at the least. We\u2019ve been hearing the next two seasons are going to be shorter and the comments by Benioff and Weiss confirm it. How will it all end? That we\u2019re still waiting to find out.", "Children get cuts, scrapes and bruises. Curious and brave, kids are constantly playing and exploring. It\u2019s part of growing up. But playtime that seems harmless can turn into something much more serious within seconds. Using laser pointers to play pretend rocket ships or make the family pet run back and forth looks like fun. But an eight-year-old boy\u2019s experience with laser pointers is proof of the serious damage they can cause. Johnny Marshall was at his sister\u2019s school fair when he saw a laser pen at one of the vendor booths. After some begging and pleading, his parents gave in and bought him the toy. Johnny was playing with his new toy at home when he shone it into his eyes out of curiosity \u2014 something that many children might do. Within a quarter of a second, he was left with a thermal burn and permanent damage to his retina. The FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health states that laser pointers with a 3-5 milliwatt range fall within the federal safety limit. Thus far, there have been no reports of eye damage among those lasers. However, there are plenty of lasers that go well above the federal safety limits, posing a risk for anyone who comes in contact with them. The United Kingdom has a different set of safety limits when it comes to laser pointers. \"... If it had been within the UK regulations, it wouldn\u2019t have done the damage,\" said Johnny\u2019s mother, Angela Marshall . \"But unfortunately, it had been imported, and therefore it was a class 3B laser, which is between 5 and 500 milliwatts.\" Class 3B lasers with a range of 5-500 milliwatts can cause damage to the eye within a fraction of a second, even from a distance. Serious eye damage can occur from up to 100 meters or about 328 feet away. While Johnny thankfully doesn\u2019t experience pain, 75% of his vision is gone, and he\u2019ll be limited to 25% of his sight for the rest of his life. If you are using a laser pointer, here are seven important safety tips to remember Don\u2019t use laser pointers without labels \u2013 Imported lasers can be far more dangerous because they are higher-powered, and typically have no labels. Don\u2019t point laser beams at faces or eyes \u2013 Laser beams can damage the retinas. Never point a laser beam at anyone\u2019s face or eyes. Don\u2019t point laser pointers at an aircraft \u2013 Even a lower-powered laser pointer can travel up to 2.2 miles before fading out. Shining a pointer at an aircraft is extremely hazardous. Don\u2019t point laser pointers at automobiles \u2013 Laser pointers can cause temporary blindness or blind spots. Never point a laser anywhere near vehicles. Don\u2019t hold a laser beam on skin \u2013 A powerful laser pointer can be felt on the skin if held in place, causing a person to experience a burning sensation. Don\u2019t point lasers at animals \u2013 It\u2019s very easy to accidentally shine the beam into the animal\u2019s eyes, so never use a laser beam to \"play\" with animals. Don\u2019t give laser pointers to children \u2013 Children do not understand the dangers of laser pointers, so it\u2019s best to always keep them away from kids.", "Share Tweet Selena Gomez has said in the past that her trainer encourages her to eat super healthy on tour \u2013 even removing most of the junk food from Sel's diet on the REVIVAL tour!

Researchers from UCLA and Brandeis university studied over 2,000 women in their forties for 10 years after menopause and found their cognitive speed declined by five per cent over the ten year period. Their verbal episodic memory also declined by two per cent in the ten years. The women were measured every one to two years for an average of six and a half years.  \"Our results provide strong, longitudinal evidence of cognitive ageing in midlife women, with substantial with-woman declines in processing speed and memory,\" they wrote in the study published in PLOS ONE. The study found there was \"cognitive ageing in women in midlife, with significant longitudinal declines in both processing speed and verbal memory\".  The authors noted that previous studies have not consistently measured cognitive performance in those under 60 and said that following their results further research is needed to identify factors which could influence the decline rates and to develop interventions which could slow cognitive ageing. They also said that while these changes happened around the time of menopause, they did not think the cognitive slow-down was due to these hormonal changes as they \"did not see a sharp acceleration of cognitive decline during or after the menopause transition\". Researchers also said the signs of cognitive ageing were not a pre-cursor of a decline in other areas of a woman\u2019s general health and wellbeing.

Over the past decade as income in the U.S. has gone up, self-reported happiness levels have fallen fast, some of the biggest slides in the world. Yet this year, Norway vaulted to the top slot in the annual World Happiness Report despite the plummeting price of oil, a key part of its economy. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 If you want to go to your happy place, you need more than cash. A winter coat helps \u2014 and a sense of community. A new report shows Norway is the happiest country on Earth, Americans are getting sadder, and it takes more than just money to be happy. Norway vaulted to the top slot in the World Happiness Report despite the plummeting price of oil, a key part of its economy. Income in the United States has gone up over the past decade, but happiness is declining. The United States was 14th in the latest ranking, down from No. 13 last year, and over the years Americans steadily have been rating themselves less happy. \"It's the human things that matter. If the riches make it harder to have frequent and trustworthy relationship between people, is it worth it?\" asked John Helliwell, the lead author of the report and an economist at the University of British Columbia in Canada (ranked No. 7). \"The material can stand in the way of the human.\" Studying happiness may seem frivolous, but serious academics have long been calling for more testing about people's emotional well-being, especially in the United States. In 2013, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report recommending that federal statistics and surveys, which normally deal with income, spending, health and housing, include a few extra questions on happiness because it would lead to better policy that affects people's lives. Norway moved from No. 4 to the top spot in the report's rankings, which combine economic, health and polling data compiled by economists that are averaged over three years from 2014 to 2016. Norway edged past previous champ Denmark, which fell to second. Iceland, Switzerland and Finland round out the top 5. \"Good for them. I don't think Denmark has a monopoly on happiness,\" said Meik Wiking, chief executive officer of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, who wasn't part of the global scientific study that came out with the rankings. \"What works in the Nordic countries is a sense of community and understanding in the common good,\" Wiking said. Still, you have to have some money to be happy, which is why most of the bottom countries are in desperate poverty. But at a certain point extra money doesn't buy extra happiness, Helliwell and others said. Central African Republic fell to last on the happiness list, and is joined at the bottom by Burundi, Tanzania, Syria and Rwanda. The report ranks 155 countries. The economists have been ranking countries since 2012, but the data used goes back farther so the economists can judge trends. The rankings are based on gross domestic product per person, healthy life expectancy with four factors from global surveys. In those surveys, people give scores from 1 to 10 on how much social support they feel they have if something goes wrong, their freedom to make their own life choices, their sense of how corrupt their society is and how generous they are. While most countries were either getting happier or at least treading water, America's happiness score dropped 5 percent over the past decade. Venezuela and the Central African Republic slipped the most over the past decade. Nicaragua and Latvia increased the most. Study co-author and economist Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University said in a phone interview from Oslo that the sense of community, so strong in Norway, is deteriorating in the United States. \"We're becoming more and more mean spirited. And our government is becoming more and more corrupt. And inequality is rising,\" Sachs said, citing research and analysis he conducted on America's declining happiness for the report. \"It's a long-term trend and conditions are getting worse.\" University of Maryland's Carol Graham, who wasn't a study author but did review some chapters, said the report mimics what she sees in the American rural areas, where her research shows poor whites have a deeper lack of hope, which she connects to rises in addictions to painkillers and suicide among that group. \"There is deep misery in the heartland,\" Graham, author of the book \"The Pursuit of Happiness,\" wrote in an email. Happiness \u2014 and doing what you love \u2014 is more important than politicians think, said study author Helliwell. He rated his personal happiness a 9 on a 1-to- 10 scale.", "Pushbullet is a popular service that lets you quickly share links, files and messages between your smart devices and your regular desktop OS. Better still, the free service also lets you see Android app notifications on the Ubuntu desktop! How? Well, that depends. There are two main ways to get Pushbullet notifications to show up on your Ubuntu desktop. Both have their pros and cons. The Official Method: Browser Extensions The official (and recommended) way to use Pushbullet on your desktop is via the browser, by way of a free Chrome extension or Firefox Add-on. The drawback here is that your browser needs to be running to catch and display notifications. This is not always practical, and the notifications you\u2019ll see are (by default) browser-based notifications and not native system ones. A neat workaround for Firefox users is to install the Pushbullet add-on and then enable the notify-osd extension we told you about recently \u2013 all Pushbullet notifications will then show up as native Ubuntu notifications. Naturally there are (plenty) more features offered through the browser extensions, including link sharing, device browsing and more, but we\u2019re solely focusing on the ability to see notifications in this post. The Alternative Method: The Unofficial App A new app called PB for Desktop offers an alternative to the browser-based add-on method. It\u2019s billed as a free and open-source desktop client for Pushbullet, and is totally unofficial, too. Its developer says he created the cross-platform app out of an \"unwillingness to run Chrome for receiving non-native notifications. I set out to implement the core user experience of receiving native notifications on the basis of a lightweight wrapper.\" For an app based on letting you see notifications there is, as of writing, one big \"drawback\": it doesn\u2019t support Android notification mirroring. This is one of the most useful features of Pushbullet. It lets you see app alerts, SMS messages, WhatsApp notification, etc. on the desktop. PB for Desktop can, however, display other notifications you send, such as links, files and the like, and integrates nicely with the official Pushbullet web app. PB for Desktop features: Native desktop push notifications Small resource footprint Simple Setup Channel-specific notification images Notification image thumbnails Custom notification sound Pushbullet Notifications Getting Set Up First things first, you need to install the Pushbullet app on the Android phone or tablet you want to interface with, regardless of which method (1 or 2) you plan to use to see them on Ubuntu. Install the official Pushbullet app on your Android device from Google Play: The Android app will then offer on-screen instructions to walk you through the configuration and set up required to allow (among other things) notification mirroring and Remote Files. 1. Using the Official Pushbullet Browser Extensions If you\u2019re using Google Chrome, Chromium, or Vivaldi you should install the official Pushbullet Chrome extension: Pushbullet on the Chrome Web Store If you\u2019re using Mozilla Firefox (or a Firefox-based web browser like GNU IceCat) you should install the official Pushbullet Firefox add-on: Pushbullet on Mozilla Add-Ons Once installed you should click on the toolbar icon and log in using the same Google or Facebook account you used when you installed Pushbullet on your phone or tablet. 2. Using the PB for Desktop App If you plan to skip using the browser and instead use the PB for Desktop app, you\u2019ll need to download the proper installer GitHub project page. Download Latest version of PB for Desktop The developer cautions that the app is currently somewhere between beta and stable quality-wise. Don\u2019t install the app if you can\u2019t handle the odd bug or glitch! Install PB for Desktop using your preferred method. Once done, open it from the Unity Dash by searching for \"pushbullet\". The first time you open the app it will ask you to log in. Make sure you use the same Google or Facebook account you used when you installed Pushbullet on your phone.

But you will need to take steps to get your new phone set up for daily use. One of the main differences between iPhone and Android is that Android allows for far more customization, but those custom options can be both a blessing and a curse. In the past month I switched to Android after more than 7 years as an iPhone user. I decided to switch because after just two years my iPhone 5S had started to die, and after looking into it I found that my carrier had cut some of its programs to help fund device upgrades. As much as I would love to get the iPhone 7, I wasn\u2019t ready to spend $500-plus to get a new phone. After some research, I found that Google\u2019s own cell service called Project Fi (which requires that you use a Google Nexus phone) was offering Nexus 5X phones starting at $200. With good Project Fi coverage in my area, I knew making the switch from Verizon to Project Fi\u2013and from iOS to Android\u2013was a no-brainer. While I learned some of these strategies the hard way, here are some tips and tricks to guide you on your own journey to Android: 1. You\u2019ll need a launcher to organize your phone. Instead of having all phones look the same with apps and folders in neat little 4-icon rows, Android lets you pick a \"launcher\" to organize your phone\u2019s home screens. When I first turned on my Android phone I was surprised by how similar it was to iPhone. The Google Now launcher is the default launcher on Android phones, and its interface looks a lot like an iPhone. All of your apps appear on your screen and you can organize them into files just like in iOS. The main add-on is that you can swipe left from your main home screen to get cards with weather, news and events from your calendar. If you want to switch to Android and have it look a lot like your old iPhone, Google Now launcher could be the right program for you. But, if you\u2019re keen to explore the many ways you can customize your new Android phone, explore the myriad of launchers in the Google Play Store. Apex Launcher, Yahoo Aviate Launcher, ZenUi Launcher and Nova Launcher are all top picks right now. From left to right: Settings on Nova Launcher, launcher options in the Google Play Store, and Google Cards in the Google Now Launcher. 2. Widgets are your friend. Before I made the switch, I had no idea what an Android \"widget\" was, or how or why I would use one. But they quickly became one of my favorite features of the Android operating system, and they\u2019re an extremely powerful tool for making your phone as useful to you as possible. In iOS, the only way you can access an app is by clicking the app icon. But Android lets you embed widgets, which basically gives you a mini version of an app right on your home screen pages. Now I have my Android phone set up with a handful of my most-used app icons on the first home screen. I swipe left for a widget that gives me an immediate view of my Gmail account, and another widget below that with my Gmail calendar. Then, I swipe left again for a widget of my work Outlook calendar. Go back to the first home screen, and then I can swipe right for three different news widgets to stay on top of current events. Android widgets make it easier to instantly access the information you want, rather than having to constantly navigate in and out of different apps on an iPhone. Various widget options you can add to your phones home screens. Android shows you how many spaces horizontally and vertically a widget will take up. 3. You may want to use third-party apps to move over photos, contacts and other data. My experience was hit and miss with using Apple and Android\u2019s native apps to transfer my data. I had previously stored all of my photos in iCloud, so to get them transferred all I had to do was sign up for a Google Photos account and sync the two. Contacts is where it got more complicated. I had most of my contacts synced to Gmail, but also had dozens that were in iCloud but not in Gmail. In general, Android favors apps and syncing in the Google ecosystem\u2013so if you\u2019re already entirely in Gmail you won\u2019t have to do much. In my case, I had to figure out a way to get those iCloud contacts over to Gmail. In my case, I had to figure out a way to get those iCloud contacts over to Gmail. The Android website has a handy guide for moving contacts between iCloud and Gmail, but the recommended steps just didn\u2019t work for me. The site says to export a vCard from iCloud, but every time I exported one it didn\u2019t actually have any data. This is where third-party apps can be helpful if the Google ecosystem isn\u2019t working for you. I downloaded the MCBackup app in the iTunes store, and then was able to successfully export a vCard with my contacts and upload it to Gmail. From there, you\u2019ll just want to merge contacts in Gmail to eliminate any duplicates. Two file transfer apps and the Google Photos app in Android. 4. Android offers more detailed notifications than iOS, especially if you take the time to customize them. Android lets you get notifications from almost any app, decide what level of detail to get, what sounds they should make and how much you want to see when your screen is locked. As a busy, on-the-go young professional, I appreciate being able to see what\u2019s going on even when my phone is locked. At the same time, I never feel like those notifications display information that\u2019s so sensitive I wouldn\u2019t want it on my lock screen. Android will default to giving you notifications for basically everything, which I found a bit alarming at first with my multiple email and Twitter accounts constantly chirping at me. But you can change or disable notifications by either going into the settings on the individual app or by going into notifications on Android settings and go through app-by-app. It\u2019s not as easy to just flip a switch to change all of your notifications on Android like it is on iOS, but the result is that once you get your notifications set, you\u2019ll be getting exactly what you want when you want. If you already have Android Nougat, the OS makes it even easier to customize your notifications. Once a notification pops up on your screen, just press down on it and hold to say if you want to keep getting notifications from that app as-is, get notifications or block them for good. 5. You don\u2019t need as many apps as the Google Play Store makes you think. The Google Play Store is chock full of apps you may have wanted during the early days of Android, but you just don\u2019t need anymore on Marshmallow or Nougat. Doze Mode, which first launched with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, makes most third-party battery-savers obsolete, for example. And Data Saver Mode in Nougat means you probably don\u2019t need or want those extra data-saver apps from Google Play Store anymore. So before you go downloading a bunch of highly rated apps, take stock of what your Android OS already has baked in, because you probably need a lot less than you think.", "Facebook's Moments app was launched last June, which is why it sounds vaguely familiar, but now we're all being given an ultimatum: download the app before the hard deadline of July 7, or your synced photos will disappear.

So you want to dress to impress. But what sort of look will give people that best impression? Yes, contrary to popular belief, research has found wearing more revealing clothing can make women appear more intelligent. Men, you\u2019re on your own with this one, unfortunately. Researchers asked 64 people to rank two women for traits including intelligence, perceived job status and morality. One woman was wearing a short skirt and low-cut top, while the second picture showed a woman in a longer skirt and more modest top. They found that the women only ranked differently for two things: intelligence and faithfulness. Dr Alfredo Gaitan, the study\u2019s author, said: Contrary to our predictions it was the sexualised clothing which resulted in higher intelligence and faithfulness ratings. Have attitudes changed so much that people are not making negative judgments based on a woman\u2019s dress? We think there are still negative attitudes out there, but perhaps people are seeing the sexy look more positively. So there you have it: if you want to wear a skirt, wear a skirt. ", "Although today\u2019s farmers markets seem more concerned with the authenticity of the heirloom pedigrees of their produce than with feeding the hungry, it wasn\u2019t always that way.

More recently, in the birth of the modern farmers market movement more than 40 years ago, antihunger groups played a key role. In the early 1970s, the direct retail sale of fruits and vegetables by farmers was illegal in California, and the first modern farmers markets in the state opened in 1979, after the then-and-again governor, Jerry Brown, signed the Direct Marketing Act, allowing growers to sell directly to consumers. The first market in Southern California opened in the parking lot of a church in Gardena, a diverse city in the South Bay of Los Angeles County. The market was sponsored by the Interfaith Hunger Coalition, part of the Southern California Ecumenical Council, and was intended to bring the blue-collar city fresh, healthy fruits and vegetables at affordable prices. The coalition expanded into four other communities the following year. Spreading widely and wildly throughout California and across the country over the succeeding decades, farmers markets have drifted somewhat from their antihunger roots. As humorist Clare Doody wrote for The Washington Post last year, everyone who shops at the farmers market has \"already done yoga that morning. Yet somehow they didn\u2019t sweat; their topknot still looks good and they\u2019ve got on a great scarf. And don\u2019t get me started on the women.\" Every paragraph of her piece begins \"I don\u2019t like farmers markets because...\" It\u2019s satire, sure, but it hits close to the experience of shopping the Wednesday-morning market in downtown Santa Monica\u2014where no one appears to have a day job, everyone is an actor/model/DJ, and, yes, they just came from yoga. Last week, however, the Los Angeles City Council passed a measure that will reconnect the city\u2019s 57 markets with their antihunger roots\u2014and further advance a national movement to leverage farmers markets to help increase food access for poor Americans. The measure, which received unanimous support, will require that every farmers market in the city accept Electronic Benefits Transfer cards, which are used to redeem food stamp benefits. Last summer, the Los Angeles Food Policy Council, which lobbied for the measure, found that half the city\u2019s markets either didn\u2019t accept EBT or couldn\u2019t be confirmed as accepting it. Vance Corum, who helped open that first market in Gardena, said, \"The decision by the council to require all markets to accept EBT is the most positive thing the city can do\" to provide equal access to farmers markets. \"We lost a lot of poor people who were coming to farmers markets,\" continued Corum, who runs the Washington state\u2013based nonprofit Farmers\u2019 Markets America. \"Now we\u2019ve built them back to some extent, and we\u2019ll continue to see some bright light at the end of the tunnel, where people of all ethnicities, all income levels, will have some form of access.\" The largely white and middle-class local food movement, which spurred the popularity of farmers markets, is not to blame for that loss. Rather, changes to how federal benefits were distributed cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients off from the resource. Between 1994 and 2013, the number of farmers markets nationwide has increased from fewer than 2,000 to 8,144, \"thereby potentially increasing access to farm products for nutrition assistance program participants,\" according to a USDA report. In 1994, just over a quarter of markets accepted food stamps, which were then redeemed with paper vouchers. As the nutrition assistance program switched over to EBT cards in the early 2000s, the ability for cash-based farmers markets to accept food stamps declined sharply, hitting just 8 percent of all markets in 2004. But managers of farmers markets and their vendors have been catching up. As of 2011, more than a third of markets accepted benefits, and the share has continued to increase. The Los Angeles ordinance will further increase that figure. To prevent vendors from spending so they can accept plastic, managers at each market will be required to have an EBT point-of-sale machine (provided for free by the state) that will allow SNAP recipients to debit their cards and receive scrips or tokens representing the equivalent amount of cash. Customers can then spend the scrips with vendors, who can redeem them for cash or another form of payment from the market operators at the end of the day. The scrip can go a lot further at the farmers market than you might imagine. A number of regional price-comparison studies of farmers markets and grocery stores have found that buying direct costs roughly the same, and sometimes even less, than shopping at a supermarket. One study conducted in Vermont found that buying organic items from the farmers market was less expensive in every instance than buying from the store. That\u2019s not to say that some farmers market items aren\u2019t exorbitantly expensive. As Michel Nischan of Wholesome Wave said, \"People will fixate on the $5-a-pound heirloom tomato, but they will not fixate on the 80-cents-a-pound kohlrabi.\" That same tomato might cost a dollar or two a pound when it\u2019s a little past its prime and perfect for making sauce. Nischan\u2019s work at Wholesome Wave is dedicated to making SNAP scrips go twice as far by expanding market-match programs, which incentivize food stamp recipients to shop at farmers markets by matching the amount they spend with an EBT card. Local programs around the country provide such matching funds, and Nischan\u2019s organization was able to get federal funds supporting market-match programs included in the 2014 farm bill. Last year, California received a $3.7 million grant to expand market match in the state. While having an EBT machine at a farmers market can help bring in new customers, those with market-match programs see even larger increases in business. According to Nischan, markets that add a doubling program can see a 38 percent jump in overall sales compared with when they accepted EBT. \"What we\u2019ve seen is that little bit of incentive\u2014it can just be a $5 doubling or a $10 doubling\u2014it changes the way these SNAP consumers spend the rest of their SNAP dollars,\" Nischan said. \"You give these families an extra $10 a week, and they move mountains with it.\" Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O\u2019Farrell mentioned the possibility of expanding market-match programs in Los Angeles as a potential step beyond the EBT ordinance. But according to a study released Tuesday on farmers markets in South Los Angeles, the market-match programs available aren\u2019t connecting with residents in parts of the city where food access is the poorest and rates of diet-related disease are the highest. According to a Community Health Councils report, more than 80 percent of nearly 500 consumers surveyed were not aware of market match. Furthermore, there simply are not enough markets serving communities in South Los Angeles, according to Gwendolyn Flynn, CHC\u2019s policy director of nutrition resources development\u2014and the perception remains that not all residents are welcome at those markets that do exist in poor, diverse communities. \"The support of the city council, with their vote, was tremendous in helping to dispel this notion that this was for a few people\u2014no, it\u2019s for everybody,\" she said. Low-income shoppers have felt that \"farmers markets were kind of elitist\u2014and that\u2019s not the case.\" Some organizers see farmers markets as an alternative to the long-flagging efforts to bring grocery stores and other food retailers into neighborhoods that have historically lacked access. But Flynn is hoping for more dynamic, more diverse solutions\u2014not only to the diet-related problems that neighborhoods are facing but to the lack of jobs and economic opportunity as well. \"Having farmers markets shouldn\u2019t preclude us from having supermarkets and grocery stores and community gardens and other forms of urban agriculture,\" she said. But, as Nischan said, \"frankly, from an economic perspective, when you talk about making food access a quick reality, it\u2019s a lot cheaper to open a four-, five-, or six-vendor market\" than to open a grocery store. \"If I were a grocery store owner, I wouldn\u2019t do it either,\" he said, referring to opening a location in a low-income neighborhood. Flynn contends that bringing more food access across the board, from grocery stores that hire hundreds of workers to community gardens that reduce blight and provide opportunities for civic engagement, \"would help to reinvigorate and stimulate these local economies and in the long run would contribute to the health outcomes in communities like South Los Angeles.\" That kind of broad-based neighborhood change, in part driven by farmers markets, has happened before\u2014to a degree. For example, in the early days of the Hollywood Farmers Market, \"Hollywood was a little bit of a rough neighborhood, so we were looking for a social impact related to many things,\" said James Haydu, the executive director of SEE-LA, which operates markets across Los Angeles. Not only did the market sell food to residents and area restaurants, but it used public space, got people out into the street interacting with one another, and helped to support California farmers. Santa Monica was also a far different place in the early 1980s, when its famed downtown market made its debut, from what it is today, with its many post-yoga-class actors.", "Virtually all of Twitter\u2019s best ideas weren\u2019t Twitter\u2019s ideas. The 140-character thing? That was so tweets could be text messages. @-replies? Users came up with that well before the platform supported them. People were #tweeting #hashtags to #talk about specific #subjects long before anyone with a Twitter nametag slapped a blue underline on them and created dedicated pages. Retweets? RT @SomeGuy13 \"That was me.\" Twitter is lucky to have a base of deeply devoted users, and the company is at its best when it gives those users what they want. And what they want, it turns out, is to be able to talk to each other. This morning, Twitter announced a handful of new features that will be available \"over the coming months,\" whenever that is. No longer will usernames (@wired, @justinbieber, @babyanimals) count against your 140-character limit, at least when you\u2019re replying to someone else\u2019s tweet. Photos, videos, polls, or GIFs never count. (Links still do.)1 You won\u2019t even see some links or usernames, which Twitter now treats more like attachments than part of the tweet. You can now re-tweet or quote-tweet yourself, in case you think the world needs to hear of your genius all over again. And if you start a tweet with \"@\" but aren\u2019t replying to someone\u2014\"@wired you\u2019re so great thanks for everything\" if you need an illustrative example\u2014all your followers will still see it. You don\u2019t need a period at the beginning. Now, these changes are important. They are intelligence\u2014about Twitter, and more importantly about how its users use. They are the answers to a how\u2019re-we-doing survey that hundreds of millions of people filled out. So what has Twitter learned about itself? Well, twitterers want to upload pictures and video. They want to self-promote until they\u2019re blue in the face. They want to tweet stuff. And retweet that stuff. Especially if it\u2019s their own stuff. What people don\u2019t want is to spend time remembering the rules of Twitter engagement. They don\u2019t want to mention two people, add a photo, and then have three characters left. They don\u2019t want to have to remember what goes before the @ symbol, why, and when. They don\u2019t want to upload a photo only to be forced to rifle through a thesaurus looking for a shorter word for \"fantastic,\" then give up and use \"gr8\" like it\u2019s 2004 and they\u2019re on AIM again. Social networking is all about instinctive, frictionless sharing, not careful formatting and research. Facebook excels at this: Sure, it can be an inscrutable mix of long-winded political diatribes, 360-degree videos, and old photos of your ex-boyfriend, but something about the freedom it offers to post anything, any way you want, makes people come back. Being interesting in 140 characters is a test of writerly acumen\u2014like that unsourced but wonderful quote says, \"If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.\" When most of those characters go to something other than words, the test gets harder. With Facebook as a competitor, Twitter needs to be easy. Of course, Twitter can\u2019t just try and be everything to everyone. \"They don\u2019t want to become Facebook,\" says industry analyst Rob Enderle, \"because then they\u2019d go bye-bye.\" Two things define Twitter: It\u2019s fast, and everyone uses it the same way. That\u2019s why, even as rumors fly to the contrary, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and others have maintained that the 140-character limit isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s not so much about the character count itself, Enderle says, but the spirit it creates. \"Twitter just lends itself to that very brief, very fast conversation,\" he says. It makes the product better\u2014Twitter is much faster on mobile than Facebook\u2014and makes the whole place feel more lively. That\u2019s why news types flock to Twitter, for instance: So much is going on. Longer posts would mean fewer posts, and you wouldn\u2019t want to read them as much, and Twitter would be a Frankenstein\u2019s monster made of Medium and Facebook that wouldn\u2019t be any fun at all. That\u2019s why making it easier to post photos, videos, and links is smart. Those are easy ways for people to share more without requiring an hour of focused reading from their followers. Until now, though, Twitter has effectively penalized users for adding them, forcing them to give up 24 precious characters just to add a photo. Now, you get 140 characters for text. Everything else is Twitter\u2019s problem. Some of these features are designed to sate the power users, who are growing restless. At the same time, Twitter the company is desperate to get more people using Twitter the product, and sticking around once they do. That depends in many ways on giving users, especially new ones, ways to find and interact with great tweets. The best organizational tool on Twitter is hashtags, without which Twitter\u2019s still not smart enough to know what you\u2019re talking about. A 2012 study called hashtags \"first-order organizational acts.\" They don\u2019t foster conversation, but they do sort it. Twitter\u2019s biggest problem is that people try it, get bored by lack of engagement, and leave. Hashtags are a surprisingly powerful way to help people engage; not counting them might convince people to use them more. You could convincingly argue that Twitter still hasn\u2019t fixed its biggest problems. Harassment and trolling make the service a hostile place for many users. Its relationship with the developer community is broken. And Facebook is out there, pushing into live video and all things real-time. You could argue those things, and I wouldn\u2019t disagree with you. Still, Dorsey and co. are smart to see that Twitter is the most fun to use when you\u2019re using it with other people. You\u2019re getting in canoes with twelve people and @Dennys, you\u2019re captioning the latest memes, you\u2019re watching the Oscars alongside a million people not in your living room. Twitter is Twitter because Twitter moves fast, and because everyone\u2019s in the pile together. That might mean you need a character limit, but it makes just about everything else fungible. If Twitter can avoid becoming a broadcast medium and instead remain the place the world goes to talk about stuff, Twitter might still have a chance.", "- The ex-girlfriend of former basketball Alvin Japhet Almario stated that she broke up with him after he started abusing her - Almario has now been arrested by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for alleged physical abuse and uploading their sex video online - Not only has Almario uploaded their sex video online for everyone to watch, he also threatened Angel's parents A former collegiate basketball player once playing on the offense has now committed one that can possibly land him in jail. On Monday evening, 26-year-old Alvin Japhet Almario was arrested by the NBI in an entrapment operation for allegedly beating up his ex-girlfriend and uploading their sex video online. A mug shot of the suspect. (photo credit: gmanetwork.com) According to GMA News reporter John Consulta, Almario was on his way to meet with his former lover for another dalliance and if she disagrees, he would leak more of their sex videos online. Angel, the alias of Almario's former girlfriend, said that her relationship with the former basketball player only lasted for a year after he started beating her. \"Sinusuntok sa mukha, sa tiyan, sa hita, sinasakal, iniipit sa pinto...Pinapalakad ako ng hubo\u2019t hubad sa hallway ng hotel,\" she said in between sobs. (He punches me on the face, on the stomach, on my thighs; he strangles me, he tries to crush me on the door...He makes me walk naked in the hallway of a hotel.) Aside from physical abuse, Almario has also threatened her parents. Unfortunately, they were also the recipients of the sex video which Almario released last week. Aside from Angel's parents, their professors and common friends got the video as well. The video has been uploaded to a porn site as well. The suspect refused to answer any questions thrown at him. (photo credit: gmanetwork.com) Angel added that the video has also made its way into a porn site. In another fit, she said that he would do worse things to her once he uploads their other sex videos.

She was one of the most interesting and polarizing first ladies of the 19th century: Her unusually stormy moods, coupled with rumors of delusions, constant headaches and pallor, have led historians to suggest that she was \"insane,\" \"hypochondriacal,\" \"menstrual\" and the \"female wild cat of the age.\" But a modern doctor and scholar, Dr. John Sotos, has a much more sympathetic take on her affliction. He believes she suffered from an ailment that probably would not have been diagnosed, an extremely common health problem in her time that is rare today. After researching his new book and publishing a study in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Sotos wants to end the ailment argument once and for all. Sotos, who was a medical technical adviser for the TV show \"House M.D.,\" believes he has solved one of the great medical mysteries of American history. Mary Todd Lincoln, a paradox But before we share Sotos' professional medical opinion, you may be wondering why there is a debate about the health of a woman who hasn't been to the doctor in 150 years. When it comes to her health, biographer Jean Baker describes her as \"the reverse of Teflon.\" \"Every medical diagnosis has been postulated about her, it runs the gamut from Lyme disease to chronic fatigue to diabetes,\" said Baker, an award-winning historian at Goucher College Historians also often described Lincoln with a kind of misogynistic dismissiveness, Baker noted, chalking her symptoms up to \"hysterical\" female problems. Sexism in the historical record aside, Lincoln is difficult to pin down because she seems to have two distinctly different personalities. As a young woman, friends described her as having a \"natural kindness of heart.\" She was well-educated, intensely intellectual and a gifted conversationalist at parties. As a partner, she was ambitious and politically astute, guiding her famously devoted husband, Abraham Lincoln, to become not merely the president but one of American history's most important. But in the White House, she developed a bad rap for her terrible temper and sour disposition. Angry outbursts earned her the nickname \"the hellcat\" from the president's assistant private secretary. And, as one historian put it , regularly \"she indulged in her orgies of buying things,\" like some kind of Victorian Imelda Marcos. It's hard to blame anyone for needing at least a little retail therapy, if not becoming deeply depressed over her tragic public life. She lost not one but three sons in her lifetime. In the White House fishbowl, the press constantly hounded her, and vicious gossips mocked her unflattering gowns, portraying her as a Confederate spy or a Western hick. Her husband lived under constant threat, and she ultimately lost the love of her life when he was shot, sitting next to her, holding her hand in a theater as they watched a British farce about rube-ish Americans. Late in life, her remaining son had her forcibly committed to an asylum, a humiliation she endured for three months before friends could spring her. At her death, her doctor argued that society should not judge her harshly and chalked up her behavior to \"cerebral disease.\" But was it really mental illness that changed her personality so much? The medical record None of Lincoln's primary medical records exists today, with the exception of limited notes doctors kept when she was forcibly institutionalized. That's only four months of records. Without lab tests or DNA, which provides only limited detail, Sotos is left with about 100 historic sources, including 678 letters and photos from the time. In his book \"The Mary Lincoln Mind-Body Sourcebook,\" Sotos argues that that record is enough. For those who might question this practice -- and some scholars do take issue with any retrospective diagnosis of an historical figure -- Sotos writes, \"the amount of information in the historical record exceeds the amount a physician might collect in a 10-minute clinical visit -- a duration clearly sufficient to make many diagnosis.\" He argues that only one thing can account for the many disparate mental and physical symptoms he finds described in the letters. Sotos believes Lincoln suffered from pernicious anemia. The dreaded 'Downton Abbey' disease Pernicious anemia , which doctors sometimes call PA, has all but disappeared in modern life and from most modern medical literature. Only \"Downton Abbey\" fans may recognize the disease as (spoiler alert) London doctors inaccurately diagnosed Lord Merton with it, initially causing much consternation. PA was a death sentence in the early 20th century, when the show took place, and was among the most common reasons for people to be hospitalized. In Lincoln's time, it wasn't even a diagnosis. According to Sotos' research, PA was not known in English-language medical literature until 1874, eight years before Lincoln's death. Sotos argues that nearly all of Lincoln's symptoms fit the description of PA as it progresses, if left untreated. A severe vitamin B12 deficiency causes PA. Your body needs B12 to make red blood cells and nerves and to keep DNA functioning properly. People sometimes don't get enough because of their diet -- vegans are vulnerable -- or more often, the stomach wall stops making the chemical the body uses to absorb the vitamin from food. It was deadly because doctors didn't know what caused it. No treatment surfaced until 1926, when three doctors -- George Whipple, George Minot and William Murphy -- demonstrated that PA patients who ate a half-pound of raw liver daily could be cured. It was such a big medical advance that the trio won the Nobel Prize in 1934. When B12 was finally isolated in 1948, it enabled scientists to create a shot that people can get once a month and stay healthy. PA, a slowly progressive disease, can account for the otherwise seemingly unconnected symptoms throughout Lincoln's life that got worse as she aged, Sotos argues. Sotos lists Lincoln's symptoms over 30 years, which match PA symptoms , including a regular pallor to her skin, fever, headaches, gait problems, abnormal sensations as if she were being stuck by needles, soreness to her mouth, swelling, shortness of breath and resting tachycardia. Psychologically, she started to show signs of hypervigilance, delusions and hallucinations, but all with a kind of perceived clarity. B12 deficiency shrinks the brain, leading to a significant decline in cognitive function, paranoia and hallucinations. As she got older, the energetic woman who loved to read could no longer see well, and toward the end she became so weak and tired, she could barely move. Eventually, no longer able to speak, she communicated by blinking. At her death, she was diagnosed with \"a slight apoplexy,\" which seems to match the description of other PA deaths at the time, Sotos argues. So what now? Sotos hopes that this diagnosis will help future scholars reassess this \"notoriously difficult-to-understand partner to one of the most consequential figures in world history.\" Biographer Baker isn't totally sold. \"I think it is great that he walked out on this speculative length,\" she said. But she said Lincoln was a \"ball of fire,\" full of energy. However, as a progressive disease, PA may not sap someone's energy right away. Recently discovered letters suggest that Lincoln may have been taking too much chloral hydrate for sleep problems, which could account for some of her mental problems, Baker said. Baker has said some scholarship suggests that Lincoln's symptoms may have been related to spinal stenosis or diabetes. Sotos has argued that those diseases couldn't totally account for her mental problems, but PA can be the cause of both mental and physical symptoms. Ultimately, Baker said, with so many symptoms described in these letters as being \"vague,\" they may be a good fit for many diagnosis. Sotos is convinced and says the diagnosis has changed his own opinion of Lincoln. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. He said he came across the first lady as he put together a book , \"The Physical Lincoln,\" a medical analysis of Abraham Lincoln. Back then, when he made headlines for diagnosing the president with a rare genetic disorder, MEN2B, his research about Mary Todd Lincoln left him a critic. \"I came away not liking her at all,\" he said. But as he re-examined her record using the same medical style of research, his opinion softened. \"Once I made this diagnosis or at least started to entertain the idea, my attitude toward her changed,\" he said. \"I think others will, too.\"", "Whenever we post LEGO deals on Ben\u2019s Bargains, they\u2019re usually quite popular because regular-price LEGO sets just seem outrageously expensive for children\u2019s toys. The 3,803-piece LEGO Death Star (10188) is frequently cited as an example, retailing for $400. for significantly more than the MSRP during peak buying periods, as are many other popular and/or rare LEGO sets. Yet, we love LEGO anyway and continue to fork over our hard-earned cash for these fantastically well-crafted pieces of (ABS) plastic. The LEGO Death Star has been in production for 5 years (!) and is frequently seen on eBay for significantly more than the MSRP during peak buying periods, as are many other popular and/or rare LEGO sets. Among LEGO buyers, it\u2019s known that the price per brick hovers around 10 to 13 cents. According to Andrew Sielen\u2019s excellent analysis What Happened with LEGO , the price of a brick has been relatively static for the past 8 or 9 years and was even significantly higher two or three decades ago \u2014 you know, back when most adults today were playing with LEGOs. And this price stability has occurred in the same time period as the advent of LEGO\u2019s licensed sets (Star Wars, Harry Potter) which actually carry very little to no price markup compared to the non-licensed sets.

Besides quality, the size of sets is a major factor in the perceived expense of LEGO toys. The aforementioned Death Star is one of the top-five largest LEGO sets with over 3,800 pieces. The more advanced Architecture series LEGO sets often have over 500 pieces with a few over 1,000 pieces.

Federal data and survey information compiled by the Rand corporation puts yearly marijuana use in Washington state in the range of 135 metric tons to 225 metric tons during 2013, with 175 metric tons as the median estimate. The Washington Office of Financial Management's assessment put state-wide use at 85 metric tons for 2013, but that estimate was based on federal data from 2008 and 2009. Time reports that the difference in the estimates \"very roughly\" amounts to the difference between about 25 and 50 joints per resident each year. The study was conducted in an effort to help the state's liquor control board prepare for the commercial sale of marijuana, which is scheduled to begin in 2014. \"You need to have a good idea about consumption to make decisions about licensing, how many distributors to allow, how many retail shops,\" Beau Kilmer, the lead researcher on the project said, according to Time. \"It\u2019s important to have this information now, because people will want to know what the world looked like before the stores opened up.\" The median estimate of 175 metric tons of marijuana used amounts to more than 6 million ounces, enough for around 340 million joints, according to the Associated Press. Washington state legalized marijuana in December of 2012. On Dec. 6 of this year, crowds gathered under the Space Needle in Seattle to commemorate the anniversary of legalization with a city-sanctioned pot party, KOMO News reported. \"If we were all in Texas, we'd be arrested and charged with felonies,\" resident Jay Zozh said as the crowd passed around a footlong joint, according to the station.", "You may have seen her on \"Parenthood,\" \"Arrested Development,\" and in \"The Perks Of Being A Wallflower.\" But you have yet to follow her on Twitter and Instagram, fall in love with her funky style and embrace her general awesomeness.

Nobody likes it, and yet it\u2019s strangely irresistible. You kind of hate yourself after indulging in it, the Internet equivalent of being force-fed melted Jolly Ranchers by the spoonful. But as much as clickbait\u2019s trickster headlines inspire self-loathing, it hardly compares to the amount of ill-will it engenders toward traffic-hungry, trigger-happy media outlets that think firing off lots of popcorny articles, shotgun-style, will net them a few extra ad impressions. Well, Facebook users are fed up with clickbait headlines, and they\u2019re fighting back with one of the only tools at their disposal: the like button. For a while now, users have told Facebook in surveys they prefer headlines that spell out what\u2019s contained in the story. That doesn\u2019t stop them from clicking on stories that leave the news out of the title, though \u2014 and that's reflected in the data Facebook gathers on its users, said Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management. \"If you measure just clicks, no, they'll click more on things where you're actually withholding things in the title,\" he said. \"But they'll spend less time actually reading it once they click.\" That makes some amount of sense. But Mosseri continued: \"Another pattern we see is that they'll like a story, click on it, and come back immediately because they feel deceived and un-like it. We do see that reflected in behavior.\" Facebook revealed how its News Feed displays content. This came in response after last month's new report alleging liberal political bias in its Trending Topics feature. (Reuters) People who feel misled are actively going back to the News Feed and removing their likes from stories, according to Facebook. That's significant. It's an extra step, an act of commission, one that takes time and thought. And it's an interesting way users who lack other means to voice their displeasure have devised as a kind of stop-gap measure for fighting back. It\u2019s unclear how widespread this practice is, and Facebook declined to elaborate. But given the incredible importance that likes and engagement can have on the performance of a given article, it does suggest that there\u2019s a limit to the traction publishers may get from clickbait. [Facebook will now let you manage what happens to your account after you die] Researchers who've investigated clickbait seem to have settled on a few theories as to why it works. The key finding is that clickbait headlines generate an emotional response that in many ways is out of our control. In one recent paper, computer scientists concluded after analyzing tens of thousands of headlines that the more intensely aligned a headline was toward a positive or negative emotion, the more likely it would be to produce a click. Clickbait also exploits the reward centers of our brains. As Wired wrote last year, you can \"think of that clickbait headline as a signal, an imminent sign you\u2019re about to see some super-adorbz animal buddies. ... You might assume our brains get that wonderful squirt of dopamine after we get the reward (the pics), but it turns out dopamine levels go up much sooner.\" In fact, the mere sight of a clickbait headline is enough to trigger the release of happy chemicals, psychologists have found. In light of that research, it makes total sense why you might be outraged by an article that didn't produce the expected reward. The feeling, too, that you've been manipulated or cheated by some process you're helpless to resist only heightens the resentment. And to hear that some users are taking back their likes shows how little power they have to express themselves and force the system to change. Facebook has periodically taken steps to address clickbait. In 2014, it tweaked its algorithm over concerns that those types of articles could \"drown out\" other types of content. It did so again earlier this year to prioritize stories that the company thought people actually wanted to read. In both moves, an important metric Facebook considered was the amount of time users spent, or were expected to spend, on a given story \u2014 the idea being that the longer you take before coming back to Facebook, the likelier it is that you found the content meaningful and worth your time. [New data: Americans are abandoning wired home Internet] This week's News Feed tweak seems consistent with that approach. Although it doesn't single out clickbait by name, Facebook is saying it doesn't want publishers to basically take over the News Feed with their many, many attempts at attracting readers. Everyone\u2019s definition of clickbait is a little different. Here\u2019s how The Washington Post\u2019s executive editor, Marty Baron, described it to New York Magazine: The way I would define it is, it has a headline that tries to trick you to read the story and when you get to the story there\u2019s nothing of any substance. Of course, many substantive news stories now are written with webby, social-media-friendly headlines, too. That\u2019s by design, in a world where even actual news is forced to compete with cat listicles and Disney-princess personality quizzes. The results are clear: Clicky headlines attract readers. The responsibility of journalists is to make sure there\u2019s something worth reading on the other side.", "Delhi has spent over Rs 2,000 crore on Yamuna clean-up in the last 22 years. This shocking revelation came during a hearing in the Supreme Court on Monday. The reality becomes starker when you consider recent and past data that show no improvement in water quality: total coliform, or mostly human and animal excreta, continues to be in lakhs, and even crores, when the standard is a maximum of 5,000 mpn/100 ml (most probably number/100 ml). Also, dissolved oxygen (DO), a must for many forms of life in the water, continues to be negligible, which reiterates that it's a dead river. DO levels in March months of 2002 and 2006 at Nizamuddin and Palla were 0; in 2016, these were 0.9 and 0.7, respectively. Total coliform levels went up to 16 crore in June last year. No Yamuna cleaning project has managed to bring a perceptible difference to water quality. Apart from Yamuna Action Plans on which the bulk of funds were spent, the National Green Tribunal, in its 2015 judgment, had ordered augmenting the functioning of sewage-treatment plants that are running under capacity and constructing 32 smaller STPs in a decentralised manner. \"According to DJB, there are 23 STP's planned and existing as of today in Delhi....the oxidation pond at Timarpur, which was commissioned in 1947, is proposed to be closed. There is an STP at Okhla, which was commissioned in 1937, and four STP's at Kondli are lying closed due to inadequate sewerage...the entire STP infrastructure, if made fully functional, can be utilised to support and aid implementation of the project,\" NGT had said. There is no implementation of this order so far. Delhi Jal Board claims that it has the capacity to treat 604 million gallons per day of sewage, of which it is treating about 75%. Brij Gopal, former JNU professor and a member of NGT's expert panel on the Yamuna, said: \"Nothing has moved. Sewage is not even reaching the STPs. If untreated sewage is flowing down the drain, what do you expect? Plus there is no flow in the river.\" Under phases I and II of the Yamuna Action Plan, launched in 1993, Rs 576.73 crore has already been spent. Under YAP-III, an additional Rs 1,600 crore has been allocated, which is yet to be used. \"Yamuna, like all of Delhi, has suffered due to multiplicity of agencies. Crores were definitely allocated but the money was used incoherently. DJB was doing something while the corporations were doing something else. We are hopeful now that the interceptor sewer system, when it is completed by next year, will finally clean the river,\" said a senior government official. Experts also say that policies to clean Yamuna have only been STP-oriented when the biggest issue is the fact that the river has no water or ecological flow. SC, in a 1998 order, had directed that 10 cumecs of water be released into the river through the year. Experts feel that 10 cumecs is inadequate, but as of now even that is not being released. Following NGT's 2015 judgment, about 10 cumecs is being released at Hatnikund, but that reduces significantly as it flows downstream. \"The only answer to this is to ensure more water is released. Sewage treatment alone cannot ensure unhindered flow\" said Manoj Mishra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, who had moved NGT on Yamuna pollution. Meanwhile, both Centre and Delhi government have announced several cosmetic measures. For example, last year, Centre launched a trash skimmer to clean the water surface and announced a \"proper\" chhat ghat. In an effort to develop the river front, Delhi government started a Yamuna Aarti and developed a 'Nakshatra Vatika' along the river bed. Union water minister Uma Bharti had announced last year that Lakhwar Vyasi dam in Uttarakhand would release water in Yamuna during the lean season, which was contested by environmental experts because the project is unlikely to get environmental clearance.", "We all know it is not easy to avoid the unhealthy stuff, but which food is hardest of all? Iulian Valentin/Shutterstock If processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate. \"We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,\" write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONE The authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as \"loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.\" They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist. \"Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,\" the authors write. To test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale , of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors. Unsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale. As the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts. The finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brain's \"pleasure chemical\" that's often implicated in addiction. For instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brain's dopamine system that's also seen in response to illicit drugs. The respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (BMI) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components. Gender was not found to be relevant; people with high BMIs reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected. Chocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries. However, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing. A further 384 people were asked online to rate the addictiveness of each food on a scale of 1 to 7. Using this larger (and more representative) sample, the clear winner was pizza, with a mean score of 4.01, followed by chocolate and chips sharing second at 3.73. Several other foods \u2013 all highly processed and rich in sugar, fat or both \u2013 were tightly bunched behind. At the bottom of the addictiveness scale came cucumber, carrots and beans. Even water ranked higher than these. Strangely, however, while the study included soda and water, coffee was not offered among the 35 choices. A match-up between caffeine and pizza\u2019s salt/sugar/fat will have to wait for another time.", "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...Watch the second UK teaser trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens - in cinemas everywhere 18 December, 2015. Posted by Star Wars on Thursday, April 16, 2015 Has Facebook stunning video ascendancy over the past year stolen rival YouTube\u2019s advertising thunder just as it was gaining momentum? Has the fact that Facebook now delivers 4 billion views a day convinced advertisers that the site is a potentially viable alternative to TV? No, not yet, according to advertisers. Though they do acknowledge that Facebook\u2019s video business can\u2019t be ignored. Major ad buyers say that Facebook\u2019s video view numbers are undoubtedly impressive. But in terms of actual ad inventory, Facebook still pales in comparison to YouTube, which features pre-roll ads (something Facebook has shied away from) and has a more developed video ad business. \"The growth of video views on Facebook is staggering,\" said Adam Shlachter, chief investment officer at Digitas. \"But it\u2019s still not 100% clear what the opportunities are to capitalize on that.\" To that end, Facebook held its non-Newfront, NewFront-like presentation for advertisers last night in New York, during which is shared details on Anthology, the company\u2019s branded video content initiative. The affair, held at Facebook\u2019s New York office, included presentations from companies such as Vice, Tastemade and Funny or Die. The Anthology gathering was timed just a few days before the kickoff of the NewFronts, which are anchored by YouTube and its usually splashy event, and a few weeks before the major broadcast networks present their schedules for the coming season. All are competing for major advertisers\u2019 marketing budgets. While Facebook got in front of advertisers first, it hasn\u2019t necessarily taken the wind out of YouTube\u2019s sails\u2013or sales. \"I don\u2019t think what [Facebook is] doing throws a wrench in anything YouTube is doing,\" said John Swift, Omnicom Media Group\u2019s chief executive of North American investment. To be sure, YouTube\u2019s ad strategy is far from perfect (as WSJ reported recently, the site has struggled to reach profitability). But the Google-owned video behemoth has made great strides over the past few years catering to advertisers\u2019 demands for more TV-like data and buying options, while also making a concerted effort to market its biggest stars. And there\u2019s no question that video ads posted on Facebook\u2013like the \"Star Wars\" movie trailer\u2013can take off like wildfire. Of course, those instances don\u2019t always consist of solely paid media efforts. Let's catch that teaser trailer again! Marvel's \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" in theaters May 1, 2015. Posted by Avengers on Thursday, October 23, 2014 For example, Visible Measures looked at 82 Web video campaigns released in March that in aggregate reached 437.5 million people through a combination of paid advertising or organic, people-driven sharing. More than half of those campaigns used Facebook. Among all the campaigns released in March, Facebook accounted for 35% of total viewership, versus 65% for YouTube. At the end of last year, Facebook\u2019s share was in the single digits, found Visible Measures. \"There is a huge opportunity for Facebook to grab video ad dollars because of its targeting,\" said Brian Shin, Visible Measures\u2019 chief executive. \"But we don\u2019t see those dollars coming from YouTube.\" Yet Facebook doesn\u2019t seem to be in a huge rush to fully monetize its 4 billion daily video streams. Executives declined to provide much in the way of detail about the company\u2019s long-term plans for its video ad business during yesterday\u2019s earnings call. In the near term, the Anthology-branded partnership deals provide a way for the company to learn what its users like in terms of video alongside content creators and marketers. One interesting note from last night\u2019s gathering, according to several executives in attendance, is that Facebook and its Anthology partners spoke about using the social network\u2019s rich data set to inform what sort of programming gets developed through these deals. \"Facebook\u2019s focus on real identity allows for rich creative development [and] personalization at scale,\" stated Steven Kydd, co-founder of Tastemade.", "TOM Hiddleston has broke his silence on his split from Taylor Swift on the red carpet. The couple were together for just three months in a highly publicised relationship over the summer. Speaking to PEOPLE at the Emmys, Tom revealed that the two were still friendly. Asked if they were amicable, Tom said: \"Yes. Yes, we are.\" Taylor was criticised after moving on from Calvin Harris so quickly after they split, but it looks like Tom isn't mending much of a broken heart. The Night Manager star attended last night's Emmy Awards, where he was spotted getting close with actress Priyanka Chopra. According to E! News , multiple witnesses saw the pair both \"openly flirting with each other\" at an afterparty. \"Tom had his arm around her and held her close. Afterwards, Tom and Priyanka talked closely and were holding hands at one point for a few moments,\" said an insider. \"Priyanka fixed Tom's bow-tie and then the two kissed on both cheeks.\" Apparently, Tom was so taken by the former Miss World star that he put his number into the Quantico star's phone. \"Priyanka and Tom said goodbye and she told him that she will see him later,\" added the source. \"They left the event about a minute after each other.\" Tom's appearance on the red carpet last night was his first since he officially broke things off with Taylor. The British actor, who was nominated for his role as Jonathan Pine in The Night Manager, looked dapper as he joined his co-stars Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman on the red carpet. Shortly before the big night, a source claimed that Tom was dreading the thought of bumping into his ex at an afterparty. \"He is still shellshocked over their split and just setting eyes on her could send him into a tailspin,\" claimed an insider.", "When asked to describe the current state of California cuisine, chef Daniel Patterson replies with a simple, \"I don't think I'm qualified to answer that.\" Modest words from someone who has been lauded as \"a leading force in California cuisine\" and \"the man single-handedly reinventing California cuisine,\" and whose food has been revered as \"a signature cerebral brand of California cuisine.\" Whether he chooses to embrace these accolades or not, Patterson's cooking undoubtedly embodies the very best of California cooking, fusing fresh and seasonal local treasures with innovative preparations and presentations. The proprietor of San Francisco's double-Michelin-starred Coi shows the figs-on-a-plate crowd who's boss, transforming ingredients into the very best versions of themselves: asparagus blanched in asparagus water, strawberries coated in a strawberry glaze. And his influence continues to expand throughout the Bay Area and the world. Alongside the enduring popularity of Coi and his handful of restaurants in downtown Oakland, Patterson's first-ever cookbook, the aptly titled \"Coi: Stories and Recipes,\" comes out this month (he's also an avid food writer, and the book features original essays that accompany dozens of recipes). The newest addition to Patterson's ever-expanding empire will be the \"very casual\" Alta CA, slated to open in San Francisco's burgeoning Mid-Market neighborhood later this year. The Huffington Post recently caught up with Patterson to see if we could glean any morsels of wisdom from the self-taught chef and father of two. Herewith, a few lessons from an icon most certainly qualified to discuss the state of California cuisine and beyond. Patterson, right, preparing food in Madrid. 1) Eat your veggies. Coi's evolving tasting menu is often vegetable-centric, a testament to the flavor complexity of plants. \"It's how we like to cook; it's how I like to eat,\" Patterson says, adding that Northern California is known for its produce. \"We have extraordinary vegetables here ... it's more challenging and ultimately rewarding for me to work with products that have a much greater range of flavor.\" 2) Enjoy said veggies a few weeks after their season starts. \"We won't take things at the beginning of the season,\" Patterson, who sources his menu from a wide range of \"the very best\" foragers and producers in the Bay Area, explains. \"We wait until they are at peak flavor.\" 3) Ingredients dictate everything. The dishes on Patterson's menus take shape only after he and his team know exactly which ingredients they'll be using. \"We mostly focus on what tastes good,\" he says. \"We'll let the ingredients talk a little bit, figure out where they want to go at any given time.\" 4) Don't serve complex foods to your 4-year-old. When asked if he feeds his son dishes from the Coi menu, Patterson responds with, \"Hell no!\" At home, he says, he focuses on simple meals. \"We have a slow cooker,\" he says. \"I'll roast a chicken, throw the bones in with some water. Add some vegetables, take the bones out, put in some beans, turn that into dinner with some greens.\" 5) You can succeed without a mentor. Patterson never attended culinary school or worked under a renowned chef, instead opting to open his first restaurant in Sonoma at the age of 25. \"I was able to start cooking and figure out what my style was without any preconceived ideas,\" he says. \"At the same time, I think it took me a lot longer to figure things out than it would have if I\u2019d worked under a mentor. That would have been great, too -- there are pros and cons to both.\" 6) It's no fun to play favorites. \"My favorite dish is always the next one I'm working on,\" Patterson says.", "If you spend a lot of time looking at photos of Prince William and his 3-year-old son, Prince George (as we most definitely do), you might have noticed that the Duke of Cambridge often kneels down while talking to his son. He did it at Princess Charlotte's christening ... ... at a polo match for charity ... ... and with President Obama during a presidential visit to Kensington Palace. He was even scolded by the Queen for doing it at the Trooping the Colour event! The Queen might not have appreciated Prince William using this parenting technique in such a formal setting, but according to the experts, the Duke of Cambridge's squatting trick is one all parents could stand to steal. When the Duke of Cambridge crouches down to Prince George's level, he's able to look into the toddler's eyes. Experts consider this to be an \"active listening\" technique, People reports, and it can help children feel like what they're saying really matters to their parents. Child development expert Gill Connel writes in A Moving Child Is a Learning Child that the Duke of Cambridge's gesture can \"foster self-esteem in powerful ways while encouraging his children to communicate even more.\" And isn't that sweet? Of course, listening to and talking with your child involves more than just squatting down to eye level. The Center For Parenting Education recommends that parents stop what they're doing and give a child their full attention when they're talking, Parent Herald reports. After all, positioning yourself to actively listen only does so much good if you aren't actually, you know, listening. So next time your child wants your attention, try crouching down and looking them in the eye while they talk to you. It's easy, it'll boost their self-esteem \u2014 and it's Royal Family-approved. (Thanks, William!) [h/t People]", "In the classic 1966 science fiction film, Fantastic Voyage , a submarine is shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain. The film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when Raquel Welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her. The antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body. For an immunologist Fantastic Voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked One, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape \u2013 to forestall future invasions \u2013 before destroying it. The alternative \u2013 clonal selection theory \u2013 says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction. The instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . The makers of the film followed Pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and Welch made for better cinema isn\u2019t clear. However, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument. Nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. Scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. In the 1930s Karl Landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally. This led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. This would require billions of different antibodies. And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. But there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible. The GOD problem in several In the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. This led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. It was termed the \"generation of diversity\", or GOD problem. The GOD problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted Nobel Prizes . Scientists showed that GOD was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences The difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. Perhaps most notably Ce\u0301sar Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies. He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. In doing so he developed, together with Georges Ko\u0308hler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody Milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . In economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of US$75 billion in 2013. In an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question. Scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions. They often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose. Applications that could save millions of lives.", "Durham Family / Flickr In Michigan last spring, Martin Durham was shot and killed in his own home. His wife was also shot but she survived. Nobody was ever prosecuted for the murder, but now things may all be about to change because of the weirdest witness \u2013 an African grey parrot called Bud. According to The Independent, in this fascinating tale of chance which bears a massive resemblance to the storylines of 1950\u2019s detective shows, Mr Durham\u2019s parents are begging police to treat the parrot as a witness after a video emerged of the foul-mouthed bird repeatedly saying \u2018don\u2019t fucking shoot\u2019. Police originally believed that the murder was part of a double murder \u2013 that is until Durham\u2019s wife, Glenna, woke up several hours later. Michigan State Police have since revealed that they believe Glenna to be the main suspect in what they think was intended to be a murder-suicide, after a Freedom of Information request was sent in by 24 Hour News 8 \u2013 however, Glenna stoutly denies all accusations. Speaking to Wood TV, Mr Durham\u2019s parents said that they had become frustrated that nobody has been charged in the death, and that the police investigation is still ongoing \u2013 while also pleading the police to use the parrot, named Bud, as a witness.

Byrd, now 72, was adopted as a baby in 1943 by her black parents, who never told her that her biological parents were actually white, she said, explaining that she only uncovered the truth in 2013 about her birth after she went on a search for her biological parents' history. \"It was overwhelming,\" she told ABC News today. \"You cannot erase 70 years of your life and just accept what the papers say instantly. It's like 70 years pass by, and in a blink of an eye, you\u2019re a different race.\" And though her story may sound similar to that of Rachel Dolezal, the former NAACP leader whose parents accused her of pretending to be black, Byrd said she wants to make it clear she and Dolezal actually very different. \"She upsets me so much because I don\u2019t understand why she or anyone needs to lie about their race or their ethnic group,\" said Byrd, of Converse, Texas. \"I did not know I was born white. She knew it.\" Byrd's story is a complicated one, and it starts in Kansas City, Missouri, on Sept. 27, 1942, when she was born Jeanette Beagle to her white parents, Daisy Beagle and Earl Beagle, she learned from her adoption documents. KENS \"Daisy and Earl were legally married, but Earl would go away and come back and go away in come back,\" she said. \"In 1943, during a time he left Daisy, she had an accident. She fell 30 feet from a Kansas City trolley and wasn't able to care for her then five children. She was in the hospital for a year, and all of her children were placed in a children's home.\" Though Daisy Beagle eventually took four of her children back, she left behind Byrd, who was the youngest and still a baby, and Byrd said she suspects it was because her birth mother realized she wouldn't be able to take care of her. Byrd was legally adopted by a black couple, Ray Wagner and Edwinna Wagner, who couldn't have children of their own, Byrd said, adding that her name was changed to \"Verda Ann Wagner.\" She later married and changed her last name to Byrd. Strangers would assume Byrd took after her light-skinned mother, Byrd said, and because she had curly hair that could be styled similarly to black women's hair, no one in Newton, Kansas, where she grew up, questioned her about her race, she said. \"I went to a white school because our town was small and our schools weren't segregated,\" she said. \"And other than my dad getting paid less than his white counterparts, my family didn't experience much discrimination because my mom and I were lighter-skinned and there weren't a lot of African Americans in Newton.\" The dynamics in Newton however, were much different than that of nearby segregated metropolis Topeka, where Byrd and her family sometimes attended church, she said. \"I was friends with Linda Brown, who was the daughter of the pastor of the AME church I went to youth group conferences with,\" Byrd said. Brown was involved in the landmark Supreme Court case Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, which ruled school segregation unconstitutional. Byrd said she \"lived the black experience\" even more so at 21 when she moved to a black community where her aunt and uncle lived in St. Paul, Minnesota, to start work. \"I then began to have black boyfriends, go to black churches and go to black social clubs,\" she said. \"In church classes, I studied the [civil rights] marches and studied our black history, that kind of stuff. I knew who Martin Luther King was and what he stood for. I knew about Emmett Till, Malcolm X, the KKK, that kind of stuff. This was the era I lived and grew up in.\" Byrd eventually married a black man, who served in the Air Force, and she traveled often with him depending on where he was deployed, she said, adding that they've now been married for over 36 years and have one daughter together. \"Even when my mom died 30 years ago and I first discovered the adoption document with my birth name, we were traveling to Paris, Tokyo, Germany, all these places, so I didn't really think about my birth or adoption or race,\" she said. KENS Byrd came across the documents again in 2013, after the couple retired in Converse, Texas, a suburb outside of San Antonio. \"At that time, I thought, now I have the peace of mind to find out who this Jeanette Beagle really is,\" Byrd said, explaining that she hired a researcher to help her trace her biological history and adoption records. \"I had to read them over and over and over again for two to three days,\" she said, explaining that the experience was overwhelming and that she found out she actually had 10 biological siblings, only four of whom are still alive. But today, two years after the revelation, she's come to terms with her experience and identity, Byrd said, adding she recently reunited with some of her biological siblings. \"I've accepted my life, because as a trans-racial adoptee, it is what it is,\" she said. \"I am still comfortable as Verda Ann Wagner Byrd. When I die, and when I'm six feet under, my tombstone is not going to have the word 'race' on it. I'm lucky to have two moms and dads.\" As for what race she currently identifies as, Byrd said she believes she is \"a beautiful black woman\" and that she recently checked white, black and other on paperwork at a military hospital facility in San Antonio. \"If they need clarification, I can give it to them,\" she said. \"I was born white, but my whole life, I've lived the black experience.\"", "Posted: 1 September, 2016 by Phoebe Newling This one tip might just improve your Tinder game by 100%.

But new research shows that making this one change\u2014paying more attention to how much you eat rather than what you eat\u2014is the gold standard if you want to lose weight. In fact, scientists at Cambridge University in the UK have found that cutting back on serving size alone can help Americans eat an average of 527 fewer calories per day, resulting in a weight loss of about one pound per week.  Researchers crunched the numbers on more than 60 studies on food intake and found that increasing portion sizes have caused us all to eat more, regardless of our gender, hunger levels, how thin or fat we are, or our amount of self-reported willpower. In particular, they found that supersized portions can add more than 500 calories to each of our plates every day, which has only helped to make us fatter and fatter.  \"The message is that, however it happens, reducing the amounts of food that end up in front of us in the first place is key [to weight loss],\" says Gareth Hollands, PhD, senior research associate at Cambridge University School of Clinical Medicine and coauthor of the paper. But there's one big problem: The first and only step of portion control\u2014eat less\u2014is notoriously difficult to do. So how do you accomplish the feat? Here are the top meal-reshaping, fat-blasting tips from Lisa Young, PhD, author of The Portion Teller. 1. Forget about portions when you eat out, because restaurants are notorious for serving oversize meals. Resolve before you even walk into a restaurant to split an entr\u00e9e, supplementing with a salad or veggie side dish. Avoid all-you-can-eat deals, and wait to have your cocktail until after your meal, since alcohol is proven to trigger overeating. 2. Downsize your plates and glasses to smaller tableware, which will go a long way in reducing how much food ends up on your plate.  3. Most of us are serving ourselves too much food without even realizing it. Learn what an appropriate portion size looks like by using this handy visual guide.  4. Fill half your plate with low-calorie, fiber-rich fruits and veggies that aren't dripping in butter or cream sauce (herbs and spices are your friends!), using one-quarter of your plate for a lean protein and the final quarter for a whole grain like brown rice. (Lose up to 15 pounds WITHOUT dieting with Eat Clean to Get Lean, our 21-day clean-eating meal plan.) 5. Plate your meal in the kitchen and keep serving dishes there so that you're forced to get up for seconds rather than simply reaching across the table.", "The condition is just one of a range of bizarre restrictions in the network\u2019s rules You\u2019ve probably broken the rules of just about every app you use. If you\u2019ve changed your phone number and not immediately told Facebook, you\u2019re infringing the site\u2019s terms of service. Facebook\u2019s \"statement of rights and responsibilities\" requires its users to tell it of any change within 48 hours, as pointed out by The Guardian. It is one of a range of restrictive rules that every person using Facebook has signed up to \u2013 whether they actually read them or not. They also include rules that force people not to use any fake information or to have more than one account. Snapchat also forces people to tell it as soon as they change their number, despite a phone number not being anything like a central part of the app. It does give its users slightly longer to do so, requiring it in the first 72 hours of any alteration. While the restriction is likely intended as a way of ensuring that its records on people are up to date and that it can contact them immediately, phones numbers are also valuable information. They help track people around the internet as well as ensuring that people are signing up with their real personal information, which in turn makes the data collected far more valuable. Similar rules are imposed on much of other people\u2019s personal information. Just about every app \u2013 including both Snapchat and Facebook \u2013 have a clause making clear that it can use any public posts in any way it wants. Snapchat specifically says that it can \"host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish and distribute\" content made on the service \u2013 whether it is public or not \u2013 and makes allowances for screening and looking at snaps even thought they might appear to be very private. Most apps \u2013 including other like Instagram \u2013 have some version of the same terms, which tend to include many of the same words.", "Nearly two-thirds of Americans mistakenly believe that humans use only 10 percent of their brains, according to a new poll on brain health. The poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 Americans, found that 65 percent of respondents agreed with the statement \"People only use 10 percent of their brains on a daily basis.\" In reality, that statement is a myth. Brain imaging technology shows that people use their entire brains. Although not all parts of the brain are active at the same time (just like people don't use all their muscles at once), throughout the day, all the parts of the brain will be used. Americans also have other misperceptions about the brain and brain diseases, according to the new poll, which was conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of The Michael J. Fox Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds research on Parkinson's disease. [10 Things You Didn't Know About the Brain] For instance, those surveyed said on average they thought 36 percent of Americans would develop a brain disease in their lifetimes, but the actual number is closer to 60 percent. And 71 percent of those surveyed agreed with the statement \"Men and women are at equal risk of developing brain disease.\" But studies show the risk of developing certain brain diseases varies by sex. For instance, men are slightly more likely to develop Parkinson's disease, while women are more likely to develop multiple sclerosis. Only about half of survey participants knew that loss of the sense of smell is a sign of a brain disease. A loss of smell has been linked with all brain diseases, and more than 95 percent of patients with Parkinson's disease have lost some of their sense of smell by the time they are diagnosed, the Michael J. Fox Foundation says. One of the goals the foundation had in conducting the survey was to gauge how involved Americans feel in the search for disease cures. Just 31 percent said they thought they could personally help to find a cure. However, \"there are many ways patients and their loved ones can help accelerate the search for cures,\" Deborah W. Brooks, co-founder and executive vice chairman of The Michael J. Fox Foundation, said in a statement.These include\"participating in clinical (human) research studies, providing a one-off blood or saliva sample for genetic testing, or even just completing a survey,\" Brooks said.", "Location, location, location\u2014that adage definitely applies when it comes to coaxing stronger WiFi from your router. In fact, all those things that make your home, well, a house\u2014doors, walls, windows\u2014are impediments for WiFi signals. Here are a few router placement tips to keep those signals moving along. Higher is better. If you live in a two-story house, placing the router on the second floor promotes wider reach. The device\u2019s antennas work something like an umbrella: The higher you put them, the more coverage you get below them. Just remember that floors slow signals down. So you may not want to put the router in the attic\u2014especially if you want strong WiFi in the basement. Seize the middle ground. Doors and walls are trouble, too. That means the closer the router is to the center of your home, the better off you\u2019ll be. Does that mean you have to install it in the guest bathroom? No, but if you can find a spot close by, you may improve the signal elsewhere in the house. If that requires moving wires, your service provider might be able to help. Likewise, if the router sits in a room with a closed door, open it. That\u2019s one less barrier to slow down the signal. Shift the receiver. It\u2019s just as important to think about the placement of the devices receiving the WiFi signal. For starters, don\u2019t put the Apple TV in a cabinet behind closed doors. It might even help to move the device just a few inches back, forward, or to the side. It\u2019s just as important to think about the placement of the devices receiving the WiFi signal. For starters, don\u2019t put thein a cabinet behind closed doors. It might even help to move the device just a few inches back, forward, or to the side. Remember the rabbit ears. You might find as many as eight antennas on some routers. They\u2019re not there just to make the device look impressive. They really can make a difference. On 802.11ac routers, for example, they can actually segregate signals, pulling those from a device streaming video to one antenna and those from a device used for Web browsing to another. Because WiFi signals bounce all over the house, you have to fiddle with the positioning one antenna at a time. Think of the old-school, rabbit-ear TV antenna technique. If shifting the first antenna doesn\u2019t improve the WiFi, move on to the second, then the third... And, just because you don\u2019t see antennas on your router doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there. They may well be inside the device. To redirect them, simply rotate the router or change the orientation (from horizontal to vertical or vice versa). Pop your corn before the movie. If you\u2019ve got an older, 802.11n router, devices you wouldn\u2019t expect can interfere with the WiFi signal in your home. That includes baby monitors, old cordless phones, anything running Bluetooth, even your microwave. So if you\u2019re planning to stream a movie, finish popping the Orville Redenbacher before you turn on the Netflix.", "Oct 17 - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc on Thursday said better-than-expected sales at established restaurants boosted quarterly profits and signaled it may raise prices in the middle of 2014 to offset higher food costs, sending shares up 7.7 percent. The fast-growing burrito chain has been reluctant to increase menu prices despite higher costs for ingredients such as California avocados and salsa. Executives said they first want to secure ample supplies of natural meats and switch to cooking oil and tortillas that do not contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Chipotle's sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, a closely watched gauge of industry performance, were up 6.2 percent for the latest quarter, more than the average analyst estimate of 4.7 percent compiled by Consensus Metrix. Executives from the Denver-based chain said visits to its restaurants increased when its animated film and arcade-style game about sustainable food production went viral on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Chipotle was the first major U.S. restaurant chain to disclose which of its ingredients contain GMOs - which are becoming increasingly controversial as more diners seek information about what's in the food they eat. Third-quarter net income at Chipotle increased 15 percent from the year earlier to $83.4 million, or $2.66 per share. That fell short of analysts' average estimate of $2.78 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, as higher food, labor and rent costs squeezed margins. Chipotle narrowed its full-year forecast for same-restaurant sales to mid-single-digit percentage growth. The Denver-based chain previously said it expected low- to mid-single-digit percentage same-restaurant sales growth for 2013. For 2014, it forecast low single-digit percentage growth, excluding menu price increases. Analysts say Chipotle needs mid-single-digit percentage growth of same-restaurant sales to protect profits.

Lay's joined forces with the Canadian powerhouse, Swiss Chalet, to create an version of the brand's Swiss Chalet sauce flavor. The chip will be exclusively available in Swiss Chalet restaurants from this month. The recipe for Swiss Chalet's sauce has been kept a secret since it became the staple condiment for the restaurant back in 1954, when it first opened. Therefore, the executives of Frito-Lay's and PepsiCo Canada were amped to get in on this collaboration.

It may surprise you to hear that having an investment banker or firefighter title against your name, or even a CrossFit \u00adinstructor\u2019s, is no longer evidence yours is the most desirable \u00adprofession. According to the Harvard Business Review, the sexiest profession of the 21st century is tipped to be data scientist. We employ a lot of data scientists at REA Group, and while they have many great \u00adattributes, what makes them most irresistible is their ability to tell the future. Data scientists now hold the insight cards in their palms \u2014 not by reading planet alignments or palms or tea leaves, but by analysing and modelling the enormous amounts of data produced on our sites and combining it with other sources of information. If you\u2019d asked me 15 years ago if the sexiest profession would have included the words \"data\" and \"scientist\" in the title, I probably would have laughed If I want to know the projected residential price increase of Hoxton Park, the types of housing preferred by first-home buyers, or the configuration of a residential apartment that will get the most interest, our team can pull the data, develop statistical models and tell me the answers. As someone who holds a fascination for \u00adfuture trends, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed. Recently, our data scientists have been looking at the probability of someone selling their home. Supply of housing, whether it is new dwellings or new listings, is often seen as simply a result of demand. Enough demand will push up prices and either prompt people to sell or allow developers to get a large enough margin to put up more housing. When listing a home, we know strong demand is not the only driver to sell, and a more complex analysis is required. The owner ultimately wants the best price possible, but other factors also \u00adfeature, including a mix of market drivers and personal drivers. These can include the demographic of the household, sales activity in the street the house is in, and the rental yield the house achieves or could achieve. By looking at these drivers in isolation, it is hard to determine a market trend, but give a data scientist a computer, loads of data and a modelling package and chances are they can work it out. Right now we\u2019re seeing high clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne, but this is not necessarily translating into new listings. Melbourne, in particular, had fewer auctions last week than it has had for a while, as owners of property appear to be holding off for a variety of reasons. While they have many great \u00adattributes, what makes them most irresistible is their ability to tell the future This could be because they \u00adbelieve they will get a better price in spring, or perhaps they are deciding to hold on to properties longer because they think there is still price growth in the market. In reality, the reasons are complex and show high variability across and within each capital city. If you\u2019d asked me 15 years ago if the sexiest profession would have included the words \"data\" and \"scientist\" in the title, I probably would have laughed. But luckily we now have lots of irresistible data scientists to help us work it out and interpret the numbers, enabling us to continually supply better and more relevant information to both buyers and sellers.", "Making video games is many things, but easy isn\u2019t one of them. Depending on the scope of the project, a single game can take hundreds of people several years to build. And with fickle markets and studios losing funding, even after a game is announced, there\u2019s still a chance it will be canceled like these promising games. But some games capture the imaginations of gamers more than others, and sometimes those games seem like they\u2019ll never come out. Here are five games that have either been announced or strongly implied, games that people are chomping at the bit to play \u2014 games we\u2019ve been waiting on for a very long time. 5. Beyond Good & Evil 2 The original Beyond Good & Evil came out in 2003. It\u2019s a unique game that stars Jade, an investigative reporter who\u2019s working on a case about a planet-wide alien conspiracy. She can kick serious butt when the situation dictates, but she\u2019s also known to stop and photograph the fauna when she has a free moment. The game was originally planned to be the first installment of a trilogy, but poor sales put a wrench in those gears. Still, the game was well-received by critics, and a cult fan base has been vocal enough that a sequel was announced in 2008. In the years since, an HD remake of the original came out in 2011, but we haven\u2019t heard much about the purported sequel. Is it still in the works? Will it really see the light of day? We may have a while more to wait before we know for sure. When we might see it: Ubisoft maintains that this game is in development and will be released sometime this console generation. According to one rumor, it could be an NX exclusive. 4. Kingdom Hearts 3 For a certain segment of fans, the Kingdom Hearts games are a dream come true. They combine beloved Disney characters with fan favorites from Square Enix\u2019s Final Fantasy series. If you happen to fit into the target audience, chances are you\u2019re well aware of this long-running series. The original Kingdom Hearts came out for PlayStation 2 in 2002 and has seen seven sequels in the interim. So it\u2019s kind of strange that the series hasn\u2019t managed to produce a third official installment, instead sticking to prequels, remakes, and \u2014 some would say \u2014 filler. Never fear. A third installment is on its way, and it\u2019s coming only to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. No release date has been set, but have faith that this one will actually happen. When we might see it: Hopefully by 2017. 3. Final Fantasy XV Fun fact: The game that\u2019s currently called Final Fantasy XV began under the title Final Fantasy XIII Versus, which was first shown to the public way back in 2006. Here we are closing in on a decade later, and this game still hasn\u2019t made it to market. What\u2019s going on? Well, Final Fantasy, once the leading series of Japanese role-playing games, has fallen on somewhat hard times. The 13th installment in particular didn\u2019t exactly light the world on fire. In fact, most fans of the series would agree that it\u2019s been a slow downhill slide since Final Fantasy X came out in 2001. Developer Square Enix is looking to fix that tarnished reputation by releasing a Big Important Game for the series\u2019 15th installment. And judging by the trailer and the demo that released alongside Final Fantasy Type-O HD, they\u2019re on the right track. Will the finished product live up to expectations? For that, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. When we might see it: November 29, 2016 2. The Last Guardian Many longtime PlayStation gamers have a strong connection to the works of Team Ico. So far, the developer has only released two titles, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, but they\u2019re both singular, beautiful games that have made a lasting impression. The Last Guardian is Team Ico\u2019s next project, first announced with this trailer in 2009. The game was scheduled to come out in 2011, but it never made it to market. Fans finally got a fresh look at the game at E3 2015, and some members of the press have even been able to play small chunks of it. Despite assurances that it\u2019ll launch in 2016, many fans are still skeptical. When we might see it: Sometime in 2016... hopefully. 1. Half-Life 3 If there\u2019s one game more famous for not existing than The Last Guardian, it\u2019s Half-Life 3. If you haven\u2019t played the other Half-Life games, you might be wondering what the big deal is. First off, it\u2019s a terrific series of shooters that tells a great story. In fact, the series really laid the groundwork for all story-based shooters to come. It\u2019s no stretch to say that the original Half-Life was probably the first shooter to tell a story worth following at all. Making matters worse, however, is that the last installment, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, which came out in 2007, ended on a major cliffhanger. But instead of continuing that series and playing off that story\u2019s big ol\u2019 hanging thread, Valve shifted its efforts to the (also excellent) Portal series. By now the demand for Half-Life 3 has reached such a fever pitch that even if Valve does eventually deliver the game, it couldn\u2019t possibly live up to expectations. But do us a solid anyway, Valve \u2014 give us Half-Life 3!

However, deciding what to do with our hair before leaving the house requires a bit more thought. So what's the one hairstyle that can weather the storm? A French braid. The classic braided hairdo pulls loose locks away from the face without relying on dozens of hair pins -- an important detail when you'll need your hands to hold on to an umbrella or your coat. A French braid can also be worn by women with short or long hair. And when it's undone, it creates easy and effortless tousled waves. Scroll down for the step-by-step instructions on how to get this French braid hairstyle as seen on Chinese film star Zhang Yuqi. 1. For this look, it's best to start with day-old hair to achieve a better grip when braiding. You could also rough blow-dry hair to give it more texture. Soak up excess oil with a dry shampoo and wait a few minutes before you start styling. 2. Brush hair back and begin to braid, gathering strands from each side and working your way down. (Here's a video tutorial help you get it right.) 3. Secure the end of your French braid with an elastic ponytail holder and you're ready to head outdoors.", "It seems like a no brainer but we should probably start this article off with a good ol\u2019, \"You probably shouldn\u2019t try this at home,\" disclaimer. Seriously, don\u2019t. No matter how cool (literally) this experiment is. The aptly named YouTube channel Crazy Russian Hacker is up to his crazy Russian hacking tricks yet again\u2014this time with an experiment apt for the arrival of summer: He combined about 30 pounds of dry ice with a beautiful hillside swimming pool. What we call dry ice is actually the solid form of carbon dioxide and, put simply, is extremely cold. The neat trick that frozen CO2 plays in normal atmospheric pressure is that it has the ability to skip over its liquid state and go from a solid directly into a gas. This process, called sublimation, happens at a very cold \u2212109.3 \u00b0F which, among other things, means that dry ice should never be handled with bare hands. You can actually see the Crazy Russian Hacker make this mistake a few times in the video as he reels from even the most brief contact with the dry ice. To speed its sublimation, and to trigger this awesome effect, chunks of the frozen CO2 are dropped into the swimming pool which causes quite the show. Plumes of carbon dioxide gas billow from the surface of the pool as the pieces appear to boil beneath the surface of the water. Some may have seen a similar trick done with liquid nitrogen, which, as you can imagine, is vastly more dangerous. A few years back, an event hosted by Ja\u0308germeister caused eight people to suffer injuries and landed one person in a coma after tanks of the much colder substance were poured into a pool. While the reaction isn\u2019t toxic, what likely happened is that the cloud of vapor displaced the breathable oxygen of the pool goers, causing them to pass out. Though everyone recovered, the incident does mark the one and only time that Ja\u0308germeister wasn\u2019t the most harmful liquid at a pool party. We should note that although dry ice is more attainable and somewhat safer than liquid nitrogen (not by much, guys\u2014really, don\u2019t do this at home), similar oxygen displacement can occur. So if you\u2019re thinking of making your swimming pool into a witch\u2019s cauldron this summer, you probably shouldn\u2019t swim in it. Over-inhalation of CO2 can result in hypercapnia, which, as we\u2019re sure you can guess, isn\u2019t too much fun. Have you had any run-ins with the dryest ice around? Let\u2019s have a \"cool\" conversation in the comments below! Image: Crazy Russian Hacker", "Dawn Grace lost her son four years ago, and now she meets the man who received his heart in a transplant.

It turns out that dogs can mirror their owners\u2019 personality, according to research published in journal PLOS ONE. More specifically, they pick up on their owner\u2019s anxiety and negativity. Researchers from Austria tested and observed 132 owners and their dogs. They asked the owners about their own, and their dog\u2019s, personalities, and the owner about their social attitudes to their dog and towards other humans.

They also measured their heart rate, and tested their stress hormone cortisol through their saliva.

A redditor posted his gruesome tale to the infamous subreddit \"Today I Fucked Up.\" As usual, the title is absolutely crucial to the brief tragicomedy. \"TIFU by eating a crumb off of my shirt\" ... without looking down first. Plain and simple, I was eating dry cereal out of a bowl with my hands and dropped one on my shirt. I reached down, eyes focused on Reddit is Fun, picked up the piece and put it in my mouth and chewed. An awful taste and a weird texture later, I spat the object out to realize it was one of those damn stink bugs and happened to be crawing up my shirt at the wrong place and the wrong time.

When Kevin Sjuts, the sports director of a Nebraska news station, noticed a basketball game attendee with a creative haircut, he had to share it with his followers. The fan had a mostly shaved head, except for a band of hair that wrapped around the top of his head and down each cheek, where it joined his beard, creating a complete oval around his face. \"This is a real haircut spotted in the Nebraska Wesleyan student section,\" Sjuts tweeted with a photo of the guy and some friends who were all unaware that they were being photographed while attending a basketball game against Coe College Wednesday night.

One follower, Captain Truth, joked that it was a miscommunication: \"The sign at the barber said \u2018Haircuts 75% off,\u2019 & he cut 75% off.\" Others wondered if it had to do with hazing, if the wearer of the haircut lost a bet, or if he fell asleep at a party. Of course, he could have just wanted that haircut. ... Nah, these reasons make much more sense.

But is society enabling the deadly killer? It takes a seismic event to get a transglobal family together in one place. For mine, it was the death of my grandmother in Kerala. She had been our collective anchor. My grandmother spoke five languages, so that she could communicate with all of her grandchildren, and knew exactly how everyone liked their tea. And everyone liked it differently, all with slightly different amounts of sugar. Upon receiving the unexpected phone call, a sleepless night (pierced by even more phone calls) led to a hazy 40 hours which was broken up by a taxi, two planes, a few chocolate bars, a muted airport greeting and another car journey. By the time I arrived in Calicut, at the house where I had spent my childhood, there were only a few hours left until the funeral. Someone made me a syrupy tea, which boosted my energy, and briefly, my mood. I made myself another two more. Following the funeral, my aunt, who had travelled from America, asked me to take a walk with her. The oppression of the midday sun had subsided slightly, and if we stretched our legs, she said, we would feel better about the tea and sweets we could have when we got back home. Calicut, where I was born, is a city on India's south-west coast. I often thought, with no authority other than nostalgic affection, that it looked like someone had cut roads into the middle of a lush forest. There's significantly less traffic than in many other cities in India. Coconut trees line the streets, as the Arabian Sea sparkles to the west and the Wayanad hills rise in the east. During the 13th Century, Calicut became a major port for the Indian Ocean trade route. Merchants were said to manipulate the monsoon winds to transport spices, cotton - and sugar - from there to the West. And as my aunt and I took our walk, we passed several street vendors. A man was pulping sugar canes into a drink. Feeling slightly light-headed, I was tempted to buy one when something else caught my eye. On the side of the road, under a papaya tree, a one-room shop, that I had been familiar with my whole life, was boarded up. It had belonged to a tailor named Padmanabhan. He had, with his sole sewing machine and thick robust fingers, been the architect of many of my family's fashion choices over the years. He'd cut and shaped my aunt's wedding sari. And my cousin's. He'd made my school uniform. And my niece's and nephew's. He'd disapprovingly made me my first pair of skinny jeans, and pretended not to smile when I told him that people had asked if they were from Paris. \"He died,\" my aunt said, following my gaze. \"Of what, he was only in his 50s, wasn't he?\" I asked, not particularly surprised that the news of our local tailor had reached her in Kansas. \"Type 2 diabetes. He had to have his leg amputated. So sad.\" The international burden of diabetes is a much-told news story. New data from the International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million people in the world have diabetes. By 2040, the figure is expected to grow to 642 million. That's an estimated one in 10 of the world population. Currently as much as 12% of total health expenditure goes on treating the disease. India has, until it was surpassed by China, been called the diabetes capital of the world, with an estimated 50 million people having Type 2 diabetes. And worryingly, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), that figure will only get worse - to an estimated 87 million people with the disease in the country by 2030. Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar to become too high. At December's Global Diabetes Summit in Berlin, Dr Sanjay Kalra and his colleague Dr Ashok K Das delivered a speech where they called Type 2 diabetes \"a ticking time bomb for India\". 'We need to understand and address the psychosocial domain of diabetes - not just the biomedical facts,\" Dr Kalra told me. \"HIV is caused by relatively few high risk behaviours. For diabetes, high risk behaviours impact every sphere of life. \"Indian society frowns upon IV drug use and extramarital sex, but happily encourages unhealthy food and promotes inactivity (cars, escalators, remote control for TV).\" Following our interview, Dr Kalra contacted me via Whatsapp to offer a few extra facts. Did I know that 11 January 2017 marks 95 years since the first insulin injection was administered in Toronto? And urbanisation and stress leads to the disease, although it doesn't discriminate between classes or socioeconomic backgrounds. And could I please remind our readers that reducing sugar and engaging in physical activity like yoga or something fun, like Punjabi folk dancing or bhangra, will go a long way towards reducing the condition. Back on the side of the road in Calicut, I looked at Padmanabhan's boarded-up shop and back towards my aunt. She smiled, and took my hand, like she had when I was a child, to walk me back to the house.", "Bet you didn't know the best tennis player in the world also has some serious seamstress skills. Well, now you do. Serena Williams dished about her knack for sewing and more in an interview with DuJour magazine this week. \"My mom taught me how to sew when I was 2 or 3, so I've been sewing for as long as I can remember,\" Serena told DuJour. Back then the tennis pro's talent with the needle and thread was dedicated to making doll clothes, while these days its used more for wardrobe malfunctions. Case in point, the 31-year-old sprung into action during a recent photo shoot when her dressed ripped. \"I asked someone for the sewing kit and I just sewed it up right there,\" Serena said. \"Everyone couldn't believe it. You could never tell it was broken.\" And in case you forgot, Ms. Williams is also an author, actress, fashion designer and certified nail technician. With so much endless talent, it's hard to believe that the 5-foot-9-inch, 155-pound beauty has struggled with self-esteem. \"I wasn't always confident,\" Williams revealed. \"I just started feeling comfortable with myself about six or seven years ago.\" The tennis pro points to societal body image pressures and comparing herself to her taller and slimmer sister, Venus, as reasons for her self doubt. Plus, we're sure articles comparing her fabulous figure to a \"monster truck\" don't help. But the Olympic gold-medalist seems to be maintaining her new found confidence one day at a time. \"I love who I am, and I encourage other people to love and embrace who they are. But it definitely wasn't easy\u2014it took me a while.\" Click HERE to check out Serena's entire interview with DuJour.", "Julianne Hough made a huge announcement recently. She was chosen to be a host for the 2016 Miss USA competition. Julianne has shot her way up to fame with her amazing eyes, beautiful voice, and perfect dance moves. Julianne is considered by many to be a breeze to work with, but one super star got on her nerves recently. Before I get into that Julianne released a statement about the Miss USA pageant. \"I feel fortunate to be a part of encouraging and uplifting them to make a positive difference in the world,\" she said. \"I\u2019m also excited to contribute what I\u2019ve learned in over a decade in front of the camera and behind the scenes as a performer and choreographer on live television to the Miss USA broadcast.\" She cannot way to be a host at this amazing show. Julianne is an amazing actress, singer, and dancer. Yet, one super star begs to differ. Selena Gomez, formerly on the Disney channel, called Julianne a snob during an interview. She said that Julianne bribed her way up the ladder. Julianne could not believe this unprovoked act! She had never thought that she did Selena any harm, but now Julianne is holding a grudge. She refuses to work with Selena, and I am sure it will go on forever. Are you a fan of Julianne?", "This article is extremely cringeworthy for all those who suffer from acute-OCD.

Want to spend a real-world holiday in Azeroth? Hop the next plane to ... China? Located in Changzhou, World Joyland is an (unlicensed) theme park inspired by Warcraft and Starcraft. WoW has been blamed for some deaths. Plenty of people have become addicted to playing Warcraft. But some gamers take the game too far, playing non-stop until they ... just ... die. For example\u2026 There was serious WoW trouble in Shanghai. In 2015, The Daily Mail reported that a Shanghai man died after playing the game for 19 hours straight, continuing even as he was coughing up blood. And that's not even the saddest World of Warcraft death story out there. Mila Kunis had a serious WoW addiction. In 2010, Kunis told MTV News that she had to quit the game because she got addicted. \"I took it off the computer ... I still have my little twinks running around, but I had to take it off,\" she said. \"I feel like a drug addict talking about a drug.\" Mila Kunis also has her own in-game NPC. Blizzard developers paid tribute to Kunis by adding her to the new Legion expansion. You can visit her NPC in Lunarfall. Blizzard made a dying child's wish come true. Blizzard has really come through for Make-A-Wish Foundation patients. In the best-known example, brain cancer patient Ezra Chatterton was allowed to design his own NPC, Tauren Ahab Wheathoof. Ezra also received the most-lusted-after mount in all of Azeroth \u2026 Ezra was also the first player to be given the stunningly beautiful (and still ultra-rare) Ashes of Al'ar flying phoenix mount.

Gnomes are too short for this ride :( Apparently, the raid on Icecrown Citadel translates pretty well into a dope log flume. You know, once everything is all melted. Say hi to Arthas on the way down! Robin Williams loved the game so much he has an in-game memorial. Robin Williams was a notorious gamer -- he named his daughter Zelda, after all. Williams also loved Warcraft. Rumor has it he enjoyed trolling the Horde-side trade chat on the Mannoroth server. To visit Robin in-game, head to the island off the south coast of Talador and rub the Ever-Burning Lamp. Hodor is a shaman healer IRL. Kristian Nairn, Game of Thrones' Hodor, told Engadget he plays a shaman healer and mage on the Kil'jaeden PvP server. We presume he'll have a lot of time to focus on his characters for Legion. (Too soon?) Skeletons are too unhealthy for China's censors. Worried that the skeletons in the game failed to \"promote a healthy and harmonious online environment\" as required by the China Ministry of Culture, Blizzard delayed the Chinse launch of its Wrath of the Lich King expansion until they could literally add some meat to their bones. WoW exists because Chuck Norris allows it to. Chuck Norris jokes have long been a part of World of Warcraft culture, especially in trade chat. In 2011, Blizzard hired the martial artist to star in a commercial alongside his in-game hunter avatar. A virtual plague killed everyone. By accident. A virtual plague killed everyone. By accident. Corrupted Blood was a powerful disease debuff that worked similar to a real-world virus -- it was transmitted by contact with others, even NPCs. It didn't take long for the disease to spread across Azeroth (thanks to some griefers), killing every low-level character unlucky enough to get it. But that was actually a good thing, because \u2026 Corrupted Blood led to beneficial real-world disease research. Physician Ran Balicer published an article about the incident in the journal Epidemiology, suggesting games could help researchers model the spread of SARS and bird flu. Be nice to gold farmers. They might be Chinese prisoners. These days, gold-starved players can buy in-game currency straight from Blizzard. But in the old days, third-party gold selling was so profitable that Chinese prisoners were forced to become gold farmers. \"Prison bosses made more money forcing inmates to play games than they do forcing people to do manual labor,\" a former Jixi labor camp prisoner told The Guardian. World of Warcraft has been hot-button political issue. Should Warcraft disqualify you from public office? In 2012, the Maine Republican Party mailed out this ad attacking Democratic State Senate candidate Colleen Lachowicz for having a\"disturbing alter-ego.\" Lachowicz ultimately won the race. Mr. T is a big WoW fan, too. Not only is the '80s superstar in commercials for the game, but as part of Warcraft's 5th anniversary, Blizzard gave players a limited-time, Mr. T-themed item, the Night Elf Mohawk Grenade. WoW was once flooded with Mr. T lookalikes. The Night Elf Mohawk Grenade item had the power to turn any character into Mr. T. Like any limited-time item, it was mercilessly abused. (Gold chains not included.) This is the most expensive mount. Ever. Want to prove you're a WoW high roller? You need this ultra-rare Swift Spectral Tiger. It's the most expensive mount you can buy in-game. Prices vary, but you'll need to drop roughly 750,000 gold. That's equal to $300 at the current exchange rate.

Based on the book by Michael Lewis, The Big Short tells the true story of a group of men \u2014 some Wall Street bankers, some not \u2014 who decided to flip the script and bet against the housing market before the crash. The film, which repeatedly breaks the fourth wall, looks larger than life, but all the big name stars in the film play characters based on real people, including Pitt, who stars as retired banker Ben Rickert. Rickert is actually based on Ben Hockett, a banker who joined forces with his neighbors Jamie Mai and Charlie Ledley in establishing Cornwall Capital Management, an investment fund that struck gold with their bets against the housing market. So, what does the real Ben think of The Big Short Hockett hasn't spoken out about the film yet, so it's unclear how he feels about being immortalized on film and I'm not sure we'll ever know his take because the real Hockett has kept his distance from the spotlight, and is now a survivalist living a quiet life in Berkeley, Calif. According to Pitt's interview with Vulture, Hockett hasn't spoken out about the film yet, so it's unclear how he feels about being immortalized on film and I'm not sure we'll ever know his take because the real Hockett has kept his distance from the spotlight, and is now a survivalist living a quiet life in Berkeley, Calif. According to Pitt's interview with Vulture, Hockett lives in a home that is impossible to access by car . Given Hockett's solitude, I'd wager that it's unlikely he'd approve of being made into a product of Hollywood. It might seem like anybody lucky enough to be played by Pitt in a movie wouldn't have anything to complain about, but, to be fair, Pitt's turn as Ben Rickert in The Big Short isn't the actor's most glamorous turn. Dressed in ill-fitting suits with clear glasses and a grey beard, Pitt embraced the look of a bored professional for the film. Still, despite any makeunders, it's hard to think that Pitt's casting would be a point of contention. It's more likely that Hockett would be concerned with how audiences respond to the character of The Big Short can be seen as a story about underdogs and outcasts who beat the system. This narrative of the regular guy profiting off of the corruption of big banks is certainly how The Big Short is being sold to audiences, as evidenced by the early trailers released for the film. On the other hand, The Big Short is a story about brilliant minds who predicted the housing crash and didn't stop it.

His endorsement for president isn't a former First Lady. 2. It's not for any guys named Bernie, either. The Yankees used to have one of those and that rivalry got to be pretty intense 3. It's for the one candidate who, like Schilling, stands out for being outspoken and at times even controversial during the campaign. [Elsewhere: Jose Reyes suspended until May 31 for domestic violence arrest] If you guessed Donald Trump, you're correct. If you didn't guess Donald Trump, then we'll direct you to the nearly 1,500-word endorsement that was posted to Schilling's personal blog on Friday. It should help fill in the blanks. Here's the lead-in: I\u2019ve known Mr. Trump for a little over a decade. Our first encounter, and subsequent encounters, had to do with his request for me to appear on the apprentice. We spoke at length every time we got together. I realized very quickly this was a man decisive in action and confident in his ability. Schilling proceeds to explain the three biggest reasons why he's become a Trump supporter, which he insists are not skewed by his dislike for other candidates. Each is very detailed, leaving little room for questioning or back-pedaling. Schilling is steadfast in his support, though he's also consistent in his calling for Trump to show more leadership and more consistency during his campaigning. I do want Mr Trump to stop the name calling, I do want him to start being much more specific. But that\u2019s just me and my opinion. I love that he gets it. What do I mean by that? I mean if you heard his initial tax proposal and recently heard his talk around changing that, you understand unlike the liar in chief, he gets that what\u2019s going to happen is far too complicated to guarantee anything until you sit in the oval office. He won\u2019t pander, and that alone sets him apart from 99% of the corrupt entrenched old white gov\u2019t. Needless to say, Schilling shares a lot of strong opinions about current president Barack Obama and the state of the government. [Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Baseball contest now] With that in mind though, if you happened over to sportsbettingdime.com this week and placed a prop bet on Schilling becoming Trump's running mate, we suggest you not get too excited. The endorsment here was strong, but Schilling will have us know he doesn't need the job or the money. He seems content blogging and analzying baseball in any form he can find.

Today the study has resurfaced as researchers extend upon the original findings by looking deeper into the possible biological basis of homosexuality. Published in New Scientist magazine, the 2006 study was conducted by sexologist Anthony Bogaert, a Community Health Sciences chair and professor at Ontario's Brock University. His research led him to conclude that having more older brothers makes it more likely a man will be gay. Each older brother raises the odds of homosexuality by a third, potentially going from a 3 percent chance with the first son to a 6 percent chance with the fourth. Bogaert studied 944 gay and straight men, including some who were raised with non-biological male siblings, to pit prenatal against postnatal factors. His research, which reappeared in a Sept. 4 New Scientist article, ultimately determined that fraternal birth order seems to have a connection to sexual orientation. \"That means for each male gestation that occurs, something changes in a woman\u2019s body that makes her more likely to give birth to a gay son,\" as Brock University explains Bogaert's findings. An abstract from the study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, summarizes the research: Only biological older brothers, and not any other sibling characteristic, including nonbiological older brothers, predicted men\u2019s sexual orientation, regardless of the amount of time reared with these siblings. These results strongly suggest a prenatal origin to the fraternal birth-order effect. Today, Bogaert is looking to determine that prenatal origin. \"[The 2006 study] was an important study and it does suggest there is probably a biological basis to the older brother effect,\" he told The Huffington Post during a phone conversation from Canada Thursday afternoon. \"It's an important study in the context of sex orientation development. We have additional research going on right now testing specifically the underlying biological effect of the older brother. ... There are no results yet. We are collecting samples of mothers of gay men and comparing them to mothers of heterosexual men and looking to see if there is evidence of a biological factor that differs between the two groups.\" Bogaert explained that the 2006 study never determined a specific \"mechanism\" -- a biological factor or process -- behind the older brother effect. He suggested this mechanism could be a maternal immune response, a hormone change in the womb, a gestational factor during pregnancy or even genes. \"The 2006 study really strongly suggests that there is biological mechanism but it never really tested the specific mechanism itself in terms of determining what factor is in fact influencing a change in a mother's development during pregnancy,\" he explained to HuffPost. \"What we're doing now is we're looking at the specific mechanism and seeing if we can find evidence for that. We have a study looking at ... mothers of gay and heterosexual men and seeing if there is a maternal immune response. So, that's something very unique and new.\" Bogaert says that isolating the exact biological mechanism or process will support the \"nature\" side of the Nature v. Nurture debate. If successful, his new research could provide a biological backing for homosexuality. \"I think there's strong evidence that people who believe that there's a biological basis to sexual orientation tend to be more tolerant to sexual minorities, and that's one of the more positive [possible] social outcomes,\" he said. \"And I am in that camp. I don't believe that homosexuality is a disorder or immoral.\" The overarching purpose of the new study is to delve deeper into the origins of sexuality. Bogaert says he is trying to understand sexual variability, human sexuality and sexual orientation as a piece of the larger puzzle. \"Unerstanding the biological mechanisms may have some social ramifications, and for me that's great if it ends up being positive,\" he added. \"But a larger motivation is just trying to understand sexuality, and understanding sexuality has its own benefits from a scientific perspective.\"", "Just ask any cat owner who\u2019s purchased a fancy cat-bed for their beloved pet, only to find the feline would rather curl up in the box.

According to NBC affiliate WKYC, Jared Fox was visiting his native Ohio from New York and was walking toward a well-known Cleveland gay bar on Aug. 31 when he says he was surrounded by a a group of about 20 men, who taunted him with homophobic epithets. \"They saw that there was a gay bar at the corner and they saw me walking to it,\" Fox recalled in a YouTube video he posted after the alleged attack. \"They said, What's in your pockets?'\" Once he told the group he had no money, he says they slammed him as a \"broke faggot\" before they \"started swinging.\" Watch Fox's YouTube video about the attack below: Fox suffered a black eye, a ruptured right ear drum and some hearing loss, as well as dozens of bruises across his body. Meanwhile, Cleveland police are currently investigating the attack as both a robbery and a hate crime, Fox 8 News is reporting. \"I can't un-do what happened,\" Fox added in the YouTube video. \"Thank God that I'm alive ... the only thing I can be right now is thankful. That's the only emotion I feel.\" Earlier this year, Ohio's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community was rattled by a spate of three alleged hate crimes.

Meanwhile, David Conley, who is also gay, was allegedly attacked and robbed on June 10 by a group of men -- one of whom he claims hit him with a 2-by-4 -- who made \"vulgar comments as they approached that indicated an anti-gay bias,\" according to Outlook Columbus' Bob Vitale.", "A photo identifying effort by Canada's national archives that started in the country's remote north is helping name indigenous Canadians in archival images - and bringing the country a step closer to reconciliation by correcting historical wrongs. Janet Brewster did not expect to see a baby photo of her mother in a press release. But there she was, Ms Brewster was sure of it, her mother Betty's chubby arms resting on her older sister's back, eyes looking directly at the camera. \"It was the eyes, eyebrows and hair that really struck me and I thought 'Oh my gosh, that has to be my mom,' because it looked so much like my youngest son,\" she says. Ms Brewster emailed the image to her mother, now 69, who confirmed it was indeed her as a child, along with Ms Brewster's aunt Bella, their two brothers and a third, still unnamed, boy. The image of the siblings, a snapshot taken when the family was living in a remote Hudson's Bay Company trading post and spent many of their days together, was being used by Library and Archives Canada to promote Project Naming, an initiative to help communities identify indigenous Canadians captured in photos in the archive's extensive collection. That coincidence eventually led Betty Brewster to identifying a handful of other previously anonymous Inuit people in digitised images at the national archives, and other images of her and Bella, now 78. \"It started with that first photograph,\" Ms Brewster says. Project Naming was first launched as a small one-off project with the goal of identifying Inuit people from the territory of Nunavut who had been photographed by Canadian government bureaucrats and employees working in the far north from the late 1800s to the mid-20th century. The images rarely made their way back to the remote communities, but eventually ended up in the national archives, a repository responsible for collecting all significant government records in need of preservation. As was convention at the time, many of the white people in the images were named for the record. The indigenous subjects were not. \"Most photos were described as being native, native-type, half-breed, Eskimo, or simply ignored in the photographs,\" says Beth Greenhorn, who has been heading the project for the archives since 2003. \"Terminology has changed and, because we are dealing with historical records that were created decades ago, I find it a bit painful to go through.\" Updating the official record and terminology is one part of the project. The other is helping youth connect with their community elders to better understand their past. Ms Brewster says most of her family now knows the names of the children in the old images. Like family photos do, the images spurred a conversation about what their lives were like and where they were living. Among the stories they shared with their family were Betty Brewster's time as an interpreter-translator for the Nunavut land claims agreement that led to the creation of Canada's newest territory. \"When you talk about reconciliation and about moving forward as a country and as indigenous people, Inuit people living in this country, naming people in those historic photographs is so important,\" Ms Brewster says. \"When you acknowledge people have names, it lends more credence to their life experience.\" The project was inspired by Murray Angus, who oversaw a college programme for Inuit youth that brought them to the Canadian capital of Ottawa to study Inuit history, land claims, culture and language. In the early days of the project, the pictures were transferred onto CDs and brought north by the students to be shared at community gatherings and to visits to elders for identification. The project now uses social media outreach on Twitter and Facebook, where people can share the photos and offer clues. Ms Greenhorn says it gives her \"goosebumps\" when she sees someone recognise a family member or even a photograph of their much younger selves in the images. \"It is this very elemental human reaction that it just drives the project forward,\" she says. Images, now posted weekly, showcase the austere beauty of Canada's Arctic regions and its people, and glimpses into the past lives of ndigenous Canadians across what was a largely rural nation. They also portray some of the darker parts of Canada's relationship with its indigenous people, including photos of children in the residential school system, which removed them from their homes and aimed to eliminate their culture. The project is now entering its 15th year and has been expanded to include anonymous photographs from First Nations, Metis and Inuit people across Canada and all its northern territories. Since the project's launch in 2002, about 10,000 images have been digitised. More than 2,500 people, places, and activities they are participating in have been identified. Ms Greenhorn admits the number does not seem high but believes that each person named counts. \"Some of these portraits are so beautiful and they represent a life that was lived, someone that's contributed to their community that had a family and to not have a name for them is sad,\" she says. \"So when you do make a connection, when you get a name and add it to the record it's exciting and you think OK - there's one more done.\"", "Tyga, who was not nominated for any Grammys this year, was for some reason allowed to host a Grammys after-party at Los Angeles nightclub Argyle. For some reason this party was well-attended, to the point that a handful of people were denied entry. Standard enough procedure for inexplicably hot parties, but not if the people in question are Paul McCartney, Beck, and the Foo Fighters' Taylor Hawkins. TMZ has a video of the trio trying to enter the club only to be told that they can't, a fact that does not sit well with Sir Paul, emphasis on the sir. \"How VIP do we gotta get?\" he asks incredulously. \"We need another hit, guys!\" If anything, this just serves to confirm the possibility that Paul McCartney doesn't actually know who Tyga is, because if he did, he might not even care about attending this party.

It was. On Wednesday night the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians, 8-7, in a Game 7 for the ages. With that victory \u2014 yes, the following words are really true \u2014 the Chicago Cubs won the World Series. But it just couldn\u2019t come easy, couldn\u2019t be won without extra drama. The Cubs carried a 6-3 lead into the eighth inning, six outs away from a cathartic victory. But a double and a two-run home run by the Indians wiped out that lead and tied the game, and the deadlock held through the ninth inning. Then the rain came. Of course. The top of the 10th inning was delayed for about 15 minutes by a deluge. But once it let up, the Cubs poured it on in the 10th inning, scoring 2 runs to provide the cushion they needed. World Series M.V.P. Ben Zobrist hit a go-ahead double, and Miguel Montero followed up with an R.B.I. single to give the Cubs the insurance run they needed. It is their third title in the World Series, a competition that was introduced in 1903, but this may be the sweetest and hardest-earned championship in the history of American sports. Making it even more sweet was that the Cubs trailed in the series by three games to one. Upon the final out the players jumped and celebrated on the diamond while thousands of visiting Cubs fans screamed joyfully in the stands. Back in Chicago, where fans in the North Side of Chicago have waited generations for this day, revelers poured into the streets for party that will probably last days. In Cleveland, a city with its own hard-luck sports history, the wait continues. The Indians have not won the World Series since 1948, and they now own the longest drought in baseball without a title. At least the Cleveland Cavaliers, many of whom were in attendance Wednesday at Progressive Field, broke Cleveland\u2019s 52-year span without a major professional sports title by winning the N.B.A. championship in June. For the Cubs, whose long history is riddled with the mythology of billy goat curses, black cats and a fan who was vilified for interfering with a foul ball, theirs is now a history of winning, and their identity changes forever. Theo Epstein knows all about that. He is the Cubs\u2019 top baseball decision-maker, the man who put together a team and an ethos capable of dashing history\u2019s long reach. Prior to joining the Cubs, Epstein was the general manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2004, when that once-accursed franchise won its first World Series in 86 years. Red Sox and Cubs fans were the longest suffering at the time, and Epstein has given closure to both. Here\u2019s an inning-by-inning breakdown of how the Cubs won Game 7: Top of 1st: Fowler Crushes One Corey Kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single World Series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when Dexter Fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the Indians fans at Cleveland\u2019s Progressive Field. It was the first leadoff home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series. After Fowler\u2019s blast, Kyle Schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. The Indians had the shift on, and Francisco Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single. Kris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center. Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning. Kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for. David Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run. I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series. If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60. In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans. Bottom of 1st: Indians Can\u2019t Match Cubs\u2019 Start The Indians were not able to match the Cubs\u2019 strong start to the game. Leadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks\u2019s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely. Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning. Victor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs. David Waldstein: Terry Francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after Game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs. He woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the TV remote and it was stuck in his ribcage. He also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses. \"My bedroom looked like a national disaster last night,\" he said. Too much info? Top of 2nd: Kluber Settles In Kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort. Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop. David Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. Now it\u2019s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even. Bottom of 2nd: Hendricks Helps Himself The Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it. Jose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first. The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play. Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks\u2019 ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first. Lonnie Chisenhall singled, but Rajai Davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering Davis\u2019s speed. David Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first. But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall\u2019s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out. The Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs\u2019 batters getting warmed up in this weather. Top of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning Javier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning. Victor Mather: Maybe you aren\u2019t a baseball fan. Well, Akron and Toledo are involved in some exciting college football MACtion on ESPN2. As you might expect, with an Indians World Series on the line, the crowd is sparse in Akron. David Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, Tyler Naquin, and that is why he is on the bench. Bottom of 3rd: Indians Get Aggressive The Indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single. It looked like it could get far worse for the Cubs, but Kyle Hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners. Coco Crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double. Hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the Indians had Roberto Perez bunt Crisp over to third. Carlos Santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing Crisp home and tying the game. With one run in, Jason Kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop. Addison Russell flipped to Javier Baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play. The defensive miscue set Cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out. But Francisco Lindor flied out to left and Mike Napoli lined out to third to end the threat. Victor Mather: It\u2019s been a tough Series for Napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs. It was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on Santana at second was overturned. Baez never had it. David Waldstein: The Indians are squaring up on Hendricks, so Cubs Manager Joe Maddon instructed Jon Lester to start warming up. It was so important for the Indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run. Some may have wanted the Indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on Hendricks, but Francona elected to draw even. Roberto Perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with Rizzo only about 20 feet away from him. The Cubs, particularly Baez, are looking shaky. Top of 4th: Cubs Back on Top A shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by Kris Bryant put the Cubs back in the lead. Willson Contreras tacked on an R.B.I. double and with a 3-1 lead, Chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game. Bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against Corey Kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left. Anthony Rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up Ben Zobrist with two runners on and no outs. He hit a grounder to first that Mike Napoli fielded and threw to Francisco Lindor who was covering second. Rizzo slid in under Lindor\u2019s feet, but was ruled out even though Lindor\u2019s foot may not have been on the bag. That brought up Addison Russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center. Bryant, knowing that Rajai Davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as Davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from Roberto Perez. Kluber looked like he had Contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over Davis\u2019s head. Zobrist scored and Contreras got into second base easily. Kluber ended the bleeding by retiring Jason Heyward on a pop-out to shortstop. David Waldstein: Now the Indians are making the miscues. The Cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero. The Believelanders are feeling like Bereavelanders. Victor Mather: Wilson Contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the Cubs\u2019 worst Series performer. But he comes through to give the Cubs the 3-1 lead. His rookie season was a key part of the Cubs\u2019 fine year; now he adds a big World Series R.B.I. Bottom of 4th: Hendricks Works Well With a Lead Kyle Hendricks undoubtedly has an incredibly short leash from Joe Maddon, but he started things off well in the half-inning by retiring Jose Ramirez on a soft grounder to first base. He retired Lonnie Chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out, and got Rajai Davis to fly to right to end the inning. Hendricks has thrown just 50 pitches, but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning. David Waldstein: That was a great inning by Hendricks. One of the most important things in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team scores. Hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that was vital in terms of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the Indians. The tension and the excitement that was felt in this stadium just an inning ago has changed perceptibly. Now it feels just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability. The Cubs seem to be rolling ever since Game 5. Still a ways to go, though. The meat of the Indians\u2019 order comes up at least two more times. Top of 5th: Baez Ends Kluber\u2019s Night The Cubs extended their lead to four the hard way, by getting one apiece off of Corey Kluber and Andrew Miller. Javier Baez took a hard cut at Kluber\u2019s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run, ending the ace\u2019s night. Terry Francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with Miller and start what could be a long night for the Indians\u2019 bullpen. Dexter Fowler was the first batter to face Miller and was not intimidated by the reliever, stroking a 1-2 slider into left for a single. But Kyle Schwarber gave Miller some help by grounding into a 6-4-3 double-play. Kris Bryant came up with two outs and worked a full-count off of Miller. He somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after seeing Miller\u2019s \"unhittable\" slider on six consecutive pitches, and then was running on the pitch when Anthony Rizzo sliced a single to right. Bryant, running hard the entire way, was able to score and Rizzo reached second after the throw. It looked like Chicago could do even more damage when Ben Zobrist hit a ball to deep center field, but Rajai Davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning. Miller, who the Indians would like to soak up at least a few innings, has already thrown 20 pitches. David Waldstein: The Cubs are really swinging well now in the warm weather, much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 runs, the most by a National League team at sea level (Red Sox had 878 runs, the Rockies 845). Perhaps it was only a matter of time, perhaps it was fatigue among the Indians\u2019 pitchers, perhaps it was the addition of Schwarber lengthening the lineup. Even Baez, who was 4 for 26 with 4 singles (and 2 errors in Game 7) hit a home run off the previously impenetrable Kluber. They are even hitting Andrew Miller hard. Victor Mather: If this were the last time the Cubs won the World Series, the game would be over. The decisive Game 5 of that Series, in 1908, lasted 1 hour, 25 minutes. No game in the series lasted more than 2:10. Bottom of 5th: Lester and Ross Open Door for Indians The move to bring in Jon Lester as a reliever had major implications for the Cubs, mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher, David Ross. Because of two miscues by Ross, the Indians scored two runs, cutting Chicago\u2019s lead in half. Kyle Hendricks was allowed to come out to start the inning even though Jon Lester was ready in Chicago\u2019s bullpen. He got a soft grounder to second from Coco Crisp for the first out, and struck out Roberto Perez for out two. But Hendricks walked Carlos Santana and his day was done, with Lester being summoned to face Jason Kipnis. Kipnis hit a soft grounder that was fielded by Ross, but the veteran who had just entered the game, threw the ball well out of Anthony Rizzo\u2019s reach, which resulted in Francisco Lindor coming up with runners on second and third with two outs. Lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of Ross\u2019s mask and as the catcher tried to go after it, he stumbled, taking so long to recover the ball that both runners scored. Lester was able to strike out Lindor to end the inning, but the game certainly got more interesting. Because Hendricks did not pitch five innings, he is not in line for the victory should the Cubs hold on. David Waldstein: Lester (and to a lesser degree, Ross) coming into the game was supposed to be the Cubs\u2019 Madison Bumgarner moment, but it looked more like an old-fashioned Cubs moment. Terrific, aggressive base running by Jason Kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch. He never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag, then got up and punched the air. Terrible inning by Ross, who made the error to allow Kipnis to get all the way to second, and then was staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask. It feels like a game again. Top of 6th: Ross Makes Up for Mistakes David Ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one-out home run to center field that pushed Chicago\u2019s lead back to 6-3. Jason Heyward was the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first, and Javier Baez struck out to end the inning. Andrew Miller, who looked unhittable earlier in the playoffs, has now allowed two earned runs and gotten just four outs. David Waldstein: I promise, were not making all this up. David Ross, who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39, who has played on 21 different professional teams at all levels, who is the elder statesman of the Cubs, just hit his first World Series home run. It came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error, then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two runs to score. Is it meant to be? Bottom of 6th: Indians Come Up Short Mike Napoli continued his struggles by striking out to lead off the half-inning. That brought up Jose Ramirez, and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop, nearly beating Addison Russell\u2019s throw to first base that Anthony Rizzo made a great stretch on. Brandon Guyer came in as a pinch-hitter for Lonnie Chisenhall and he hit a two-out single to left, but Rajai Davis grounded out to strand him at first. Victor Mather: Oct. 14, 1908. Bennett Park, Detroit. Orval Overall outdueled Wild Bill Donovan, and the Cubs won the World Series. They are nine outs away from doing it again. Top of 7th: Cubs Chase Miller, but Fail to Score Dexter Fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning. That brought Kyle Schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty-on-lefty matchup against Andrew Miller and the ace reliever won the battle, getting Schwarber to fly out to left. But with that that, Miller\u2019s day was over, with Terry Francona replacing him with the team\u2019s closer, Cody Allen. Allen was able to strand the runner he inherited from Miller by striking out Kris Bryant, as Fowler was caught stealing after the pitch for a double play. While Miller is not on the hook for a loss, the game was well below his standards. He threw 43 pitches in two and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs. Bottom of 7th: Lester Gets Job Done Coco Crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then Jon Lester ran the count full against Roberto Perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at-bat. Tyler Naquin came in as a pinch-runner for Perez before Carlos Santana hit a come-backer to Lester. The yips that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoffs were in play as Lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound. Lester did not end up paying for it as he struck out Jason Kipnis to end the inning. Top of 8th: Allen Shuts Down Cubs A dropped strike three forced a throw to first base, but Anthony Rizzo was easily retired to start the inning. Then Ben Zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by Cody Allen\u2019s stuff before eventually grounding out to first. Addison Russell watched strikes one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning. Allen has need just 17 pitches to record five outs. Bottom of 8th: Tie Game! A day after he was controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a Game 7 appearance, Aroldis Chapman proved to be human by giving up Chicago\u2019s three-run lead in just two batters. Jon Lester had gotten the first two outs of the inning but was pulled from the game after Jose Ramirez hit a ball up the middle that Addison Russell couldn\u2019t quite handle. Brought in for a four-out save, Chapman fired seven consecutive fastballs to Brandon Guyer, topping out at 100.3 miles per hour, but it was the last one that cost him as Guyer drove the ball to left\u2013center for a double, bringing in a run. Chapman then imploded, allowing a two-run home run to Rajai Davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt. Coco Crisp piled on with a single but Yan Gomes, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, struck out to end the inning. Chapman ended up throwing 21 pitches and looked like he was completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity. Top of 9th: Cubs\u2019 Squeeze Doesn\u2019t Work With new life breathed into the Cleveland Indians, and rain starting to fall, Cody Allen walked the leadoff batter, David Ross, on five pitches. The Cubs looked to capitalize by bringing in Chris Coghlan as a pinch-runner for Ross, but he was erased on a force-out when Jason Heyward grounded to second base. Heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series, and advanced to third on a bad throw from Yan Gomes. Michael Martinez was brought in as a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run, but Shaw took care of Javier Baez by striking him out on an awkward two-strike bunt attempt. That brought up Dexter Fowler, who had been one of the Cubs\u2019 better hitters all game, and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before Francisco Lindor chased it down behind second base and threw Fowler out at first. The Indians now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth. Bottom of 9th: Chapman Shuts Down Indians in 9th This game is headed to extra innings. Aroldis Chapman was back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth. He got Carlos Santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with Jason Kipnis. He fired Kipnis a steady diet of sliders rather than his signature heater and ended up in a full-count before slamming the door with a 97.4-mph fastball. Francisco Lindor flied out to right, ending the inning. Victor Mather: Extra-innings Game 7\u2019s: 1924 Senators-Giants, 1991 Twins-Braves, 1997 Marlins- Indians. And tonight. Top of 10th: Rain Delay, Then Cubs Pounce The Cubs are back in the lead thanks to Ben Zobrist, Miguel Montero, and a couple questional intentional walks. After a brief rain delay, the game resumed with Kyle Schwarber facing off against Bryan Shaw. The Cubs\u2019 designated hitter once again attacked the shift, hitting a grounder through the right side of the infield for his third hit of the game. Albert Almora came in as a pinch-runner for Schwarber and the move paid off when Kris Bryant hit a deep flyout to center and Almora showed off some tremendous baserunning ability by tagging up and advancing to second. With first base empty, Shaw intentionally walked Anthony Rizzo to get to Zobrist. The versatile veteran who won a World Series with Kansas City last year made him pay for it by driving in Almora with a double down the third-base line that energized the Cubs. Shaw then issued another intentional walk, this one to Addison Russell, and with the bases loaded, Miguel Montero laced a single into left that drove in Chicago\u2019s eighth run of the game. Cleveland brought in Trevor Bauer with the bases loaded and one out, and the losing pitcher in Games 2 and 5 took care of business, striking out Jason Heyward and getting Javier Baez to fly out to center field to limit the damage.The Indians now have three outs to get back into the game. Bottom of 10th: Indians Get a Run, but Needed Two With one out left in the game, the Indians closed their deficit to one run but that was as close as they would get as the Cubs ended a World Series drought that had been going since 1908. The ending was complicated because Aroldis Chapman was out of the game after throwing 35 pitches in one and one-third innings. With their closer gone, the Cubs called on Carl Edwards Jr., a 25-year-old right-hander with 41 career regular season appearances and two career saves, to close things out. The 2011 48th-round draft pick started things off by striking out Mike Napoli swinging on a 95-mph fastball. He got Jose Ramirez to ground out to shortstop for the second out. That brought up Brandon Guyer, and Edwards walked him on five pitches. With Rajai Davis, who had tied the game in the eighth inning with a two-run homer, due up, Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio visited the mound. Chicago allowed Guyer to advance to second base without a throw and Davis delivered again with a single that drove Guyer in and closed the gap to one run. Joe Maddon was not taking any chances and he pulled the plug on his young pitcher, pulling him for Michael Montgomery with Michael Martinez due up. The left-hander took care of business, retiring Martinez on a soft groundball and earning himself a save.", "Nav Sarao made big money trading futures from his bedroom\u2014then lost it all. It took Navinder Singh Sarao a long time to accept that he might have been scammed out of $50 million. Stuck in London\u2019s Wandsworth prison, wracked with anxiety and unable to sleep, the realization dawned on the man dubbed the \"Flash Crash Trader\" as slowly as spring turned to summer outside the barred window of his jail cell.  The trauma of the past few weeks had been difficult to process. On April 20, 2015, the slight, doe-eyed 36-year-old had dozed off peacefully in the same suburban bedroom he\u2019d slept in since he was a boy. The next day he was arrested and taken to a police station, where he was charged with 22 counts of fraud and market manipulation carrying a maximum sentence of 380 years. According to the U.S. government, the British day trader had made tens of millions of dollars using an illegal practice called spoofing, including, fatefully, on the morning of May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 1,000 points in minutes before bouncing back. The extent of Sarao\u2019s culpability for the flash crash is fiercely contested, but the incident exposed the shaky foundations on which the hyper-fast, computer-dominated financial markets now rest. Sarao\u2019s bail was set at 5.05 million pounds ($6.3 million). It was a hefty sum, but according to the accounts of his company, Nav Sarao Futures Limited, he\u2019d earned 30 million pounds in the previous five years. Newspaper reports, in which Sarao was dubbed \"The Hound of Hounslow,\" speculated that he\u2019d be back with his family in the shabby West London borough by the weekend. Instead, the nightmare got worse.  Where\u2019s the money, Nav, his lawyers wanted to know. Sarao couldn\u2019t make bail, they gradually learned, because the bulk of his wealth was tied up in investments and offshore trusts, each more complicated than the last. Days in Wandsworth prison, a Victorian-era fortress where Sarao was housed with sexual predators and violent offenders, turned into weeks. After four months of dead ends, his legal team struck a deal with the authorities: If the U.S. Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission agreed not to oppose a reduction in bail to 50,000 pounds, the firm would act as a bounty hunter, taking on responsibility for tracking down the missing millions on the condition that its fees be paid if it did.  They were going down a rabbit hole. A review of Sarao\u2019s investments from 2005 to the present day, based on dozens of interviews and thousands of pages of documents, reveals another twist in an already remarkable story. Navinder Sarao, the trading savant accused of sabotaging the world\u2019s financial markets from his bedroom, may himself have been the nai\u0308ve victim of what his lawyers portray as a series of cons that stripped him of almost every cent he earned.  Sarao declined to comment for this article. His lawyer, Roger Burlingame of Kobre & Kim in London, told a U.S. judge in November that all of the defendant\u2019s assets \"have been stolen.\" Sarao invested in ventures from which he, the law firm and the CFTC had been unable to recover the funds, Burlingame said. \"Basically, he has some extraordinary abilities with respect to pattern recognition and certain sorts of mathematical abilities, but he has some fairly severe social limitations.\" Sarao\u2019s trading career started inauspiciously in 2002 at Futex, a fledgling outfit in an unglamorous office an hour from the City of London that housed wannabe traders in exchange for as much as 50 percent of their profit. In a roomful of recent college graduates and drifters, Sarao stood out from the pack. \"Nav was always going to be the kind of person that would be legendary in some way,\" Futex Chairman Paolo Rossi said in an interview with Bloomberg TV after Sarao\u2019s arrest. He had \"the potential to be remembered as one of the world\u2019s greatest traders.\" It wasn\u2019t until Sarao left Futex in 2008 and struck out on his own that he started to make serious money. Public filings show his assets popped to 14.9 million pounds from 461,000 pounds in the 12 months ending in June 2009, long before he enlisted a programmer to build a system that authorities say was designed to cheat the market. Former colleagues talk about Sarao\u2019s frugality\u2014his scruffy clothes, his reluctance to spend money on cars and watches, his abstemious eating habits. He learned early at Futex that withdrawing cash ate into his bankroll and reduced the size of trades he could place.  That near-obsessive drive to hold on to as much of his wealth as possible can also be seen in the way he conducted his business affairs. Looking to minimize his tax bill, he was introduced by his accountant to John Dupont, a director at the London arm of an Isle of Man-based financial advisory firm called Montpelier Tax Consultants. Dupont, then in his mid-30s, was a high-energy salesman whose accent veered from upper class gent to Guy Ritchie cockney depending on who he was speaking with, a former employee recalls. Operating from an office on Cockspur Street in London\u2019s West End, members of his team cold-called contractors, day traders and bankers and tried to enlist them in a range of plans to minimize their tax bills, documents seen by Bloomberg show.   The aim was to identify loopholes before they were closed. One former Montpelier employee said he coaxed wavering customers to sign up by promising to pay their legal bills in the event of a clampdown by Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs. Everyone at the firm thought he was Alec Baldwin in \"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" the person said.  Self-employed traders were particularly good prospects because they were predisposed to high levels of risk. And Sarao, an absent-minded dreamer with an unerring gift for making money who would later be diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, would prove to be the ultimate mark.  In 2009, on the advice of Montpelier, Sarao entered into a complicated dividend-stripping scheme that resulted in a major reduction in his tax bill, according to a close adviser to Sarao who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Happy with the result, Sarao went a step further the following year, the person said.  Among Dupont\u2019s crew was Miles MacKinnon, a polished so-called introducer who had left school for a stint as a rugby player before heading to the City of London. For four months in 2010, MacKinnon became the only other director of Sarao\u2019s firm.  Around the same time, Sarao set up two employee benefit trusts in the Caribbean island of Nevis, according to a document filed in Sarao\u2019s case. He plowed his earnings into those trusts, then gave himself interest-free loans to trade with and live on, the adviser said. The arrangement meant Sarao all but avoided paying corporate taxes. One vehicle was named the \"NAV Sarao Milking Markets Fund.\" Dupont and MacKinnon said in an e-mail that they \"did not introduce or advise\" on the Nevis trusts. Sarao had an uncanny ability to attract controversial characters. He sought advice from tax specialist Andrew Thornhill, who in 2015 would be charged by the British barristers\u2019 industry group with five counts of professional misconduct. And, as the Wall Street Journal reported, one of Sarao\u2019s trusts was, for a period, affiliated with David Cosgrove, the Irish director of Belvedere Management who has been barred by Mauritius authorities from serving as a company officer because of regulatory violations. Thornhill declined to comment. Cosgrove didn\u2019t respond to e-mails.  In 2011, the British government ended the benefit-trust gravy train. Sarao paid back the loans and restructured his business. Montpelier was investigated and dissolved, and about 3,000 of its customers were ordered by a judge to pay 200 million pounds in back taxes. Fraud charges against two directors were later dropped.  MacKinnon and Dupont\u2014along with a third partner, Ryan Morgan\u2014then founded MacKinnon Dupont Morgan, which was later reborn as MD Capital Partners. The firm describes itself on its website as a boutique private equity firm.  They leased an office in Mayfair, home of hedge funds, Michelin-starred restaurants and private members clubs. MacKinnon joined the Worshipful Company of International Bankers and the executive board of the Special Olympics. He and Dupont set up about a dozen companies between them, focusing on industries such as renewable energy.  Dupont and MacKinnon said in their e-mail to Bloomberg that they \"never made, or introduced investments to projects that are purely driven by tax breaks\" and that at the time they got involved in renewables there weren\u2019t any tax incentives in place. Morgan, who left the firm, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. By 2011, Sarao had trebled his assets to 42.5 million pounds. He agreed to become an investor in an Isle of Man-based entity called Cranwood Holdings, set up to acquire land in Scotland that would one day house wind farms, according to two advisers to Sarao. Documents on the enterprise filed in the British dependency are light on detail, but the advisers say Sarao put about 12 million pounds in Cranwood\u2014money they say Dupont and MacKinnon could access. Dupont and MacKinnon said in their e-mail that Sarao conducted \"substantial independent due diligence\" before investing in Cranwood and that he approved all of its payments. One of their companies, Wind Energy Scotland, is funded by and provides project management services to Cranwood. The pair also acted as agents for more exotic ventures, such as sending divers to search shipwrecks for sunken treasure. The returns on offer were never less than impressive. Sarao, who told acquaintances he harbored aspirations of becoming a billionaire, invested in several. All were tame compared with what came next. Sometime in 2012, Sarao was introduced\u2014again through Dupont and MacKinnon\u2014to a squat, intense Mexican named Jesus Alejandro Garcia Alvarez, who was looking for investors for his company IXE Group. Garcia said he was the scion of a family of billionaire landowners and industrial-scale farmers with swaths of land around the world. He had arrived in Zurich from Latin America a few years earlier and had been working hard to build a reputation ever since.   IXE was conceived as a one-stop shop for high-net-worth individuals, offering services ranging from asset management to event planning to advice on private schools. Then, around the time Sarao met Garcia, the company\u2019s website underwent a radical overhaul. Gone were the concierge services. IXE was henceforth a \"conglomerate of companies worldwide\" involved in \"agribusiness, wealth management, commodity trading and venture capital.\"  Articles appeared in the Swiss media profiling the mysterious young man making waves among Zurich\u2019s business elite, including pictures of Garcia wearing a poncho over his suit, arm outstretched across Bolivian salt plains he said he owned. One newspaper put him on its annual rich list. Garcia was invited on Bloomberg TV to talk about his family\u2019s quinoa interests, then on CNBC to discuss the \"white gold rush\" for lithium.  Garcia had all the trappings of a successful entrepreneur: half a dozen sports cars, a small but well-appointed office in the center of Zurich, a glamorous Russian wife. He even joined the Swiss board of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights, an organization whose U.S. directors include Tim Cook and Martin Sheen.  Garcia flew to London and met with Sarao two or three times, according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an interview on IXE\u2019s website, Garcia laid out his pitch to investors: \"We are offering alternative investment vehicles that provide constant returns to investors. The investment in real economy makes the advantages obvious\u2014investors are benefiting from constant returns generated from actual transactions with zero speculation and zero volatility.\" Garcia told Sarao he would get an annual 11 percent return, the people said, and assured Sarao that any money he handed over would be used only as collateral, not put at risk. He also introduced Sarao to Swiss banking contacts, they said. The trader was again restructuring his business, this time around an Anguilla-based vehicle called International Guarantee Corporation. Sarao did some due diligence about IXE, according to one adviser, but he seems to have overlooked a few red flags: The company website is littered with spelling mistakes, and several executives are members of Garcia\u2019s family.  Garcia initially agreed to meet to discuss this story, then opted to respond to questions through a colleague at IXE. The colleague, Dominic Forcucci, wrote in an e-mail that Garcia hadn\u2019t done anything improper and that IXE \"properly disclosed the risks of investments\" to Sarao. A lawyer representing Garcia, William Wachtel, later said that Garcia described any allegations against him as \"baseless and without merit.\" On Aug. 20, 2012, documents show, Sarao agreed to give about $17 million to Garcia and his company\u2014by far his biggest investment and a substantial chunk of his net worth. He later invested an additional $15 million, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Even though they\u2019d met on only a handful of occasions, he would describe Garcia to associates as a friend.      Sarao may have been particularly trusting, but he wasn\u2019t alone in buying into the IXE miracle. Former employees interviewed by Bloomberg describe Garcia as charming and, on first meeting, impressive. He offered commissions to third-party agents to send prospective investors his way, ensuring a steady stream of business and creating a buzz around the firm.  In 2014, Garcia signed a deal to acquire Banca Arner, a Swiss lender in decline after allegations that it had helped former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi hide money. To coincide with the transaction, Arner\u2019s new marketing chief, Garcia\u2019s wife Ekaterina, issued a press release announcing it had appointed a new chairman: Michael Baer, a great grandson of the founder of private bank Julius Baer Group and a respected figure in Swiss banking.  IXE just needed sign-off by Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator, Finma. In order to seal the deal, Finma told Garcia he\u2019d have to come up with 20 million Swiss francs ($18.7 million) in capital and account for where it came from. After heated meetings with the regulator and the owners of Arner, Garcia offered to hand over the money in unmarked gold, according to two people with knowledge of the talks. Without a stamp, the gold was unacceptable to the regulator, and in the end Garcia walked away from the deal, leaving Baer and a raft of other new recruits frustrated and embarrassed, the people said. Baer and a spokesman for Finma declined to comment. For the time being, though, Sarao had no cause for concern. IXE sent him periodic statements showing the interest accruing in his accounts. As ever, he was happy to let it sit there and grow. By then, Sarao\u2019s readiness to consider almost any opportunity that offered an attractive rate of return was well-established. After another strong year in 2013, Dupont and MacKinnon introduced him to Damien O\u2019Brien, a physically imposing Irish entrepreneur with aspirations to revolutionize the online-gaming industry. The unique selling point of O\u2019Brien\u2019s company, Iconic Worldwide Gaming, according to a pitch document seen by Bloomberg, was that it allowed gamblers to bet on movements in currencies and securities using an interface that looked like an online casino, with a roulette wheel and buttons for \"higher\" and \"lower\" instead of red and black. The patented software was called MINDGames, short for Market Influenced Number Determination games.      The concept may not have pleased Gamblers Anonymous, but the financial projections were enticing. O\u2019Brien predicted in the pitch document that Iconic would go from a standing start to a cash balance of 110 million pounds by the end of its third year. There were also some reassuring names on the board: Robin Jacob, a U.K. appeals court judge, and David Michels, a former deputy chairman of Marks & Spencer.  In July 2014, documents show, Sarao invested 2.2 million pounds in Iconic. Cranwood Holdings extended loans of an additional 1 million pounds, according to one Sarao adviser. He was, several times over, the largest investor in the company. Dupont and MacKinnon said in their e-mail that Sarao was an experienced gambler and trader who conducted his own due diligence on the gaming sector before investing. They also said they objected when Sarao told them he planned to lend money to Iconic. O\u2019Brien didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Jacob and Michels said they were no longer board members. In the months following Sarao\u2019s investment, O\u2019Brien went on a campaign to increase Iconic\u2019s profile. The company sponsored World Touring Car Championship driver Rob Huff and filmed a slick advertisement with mixed martial arts superstar Conor McGregor. O\u2019Brien and his employees were photographed ringside or wining and dining clients. In one shot taken in Las Vegas and posted on Twitter, a line of promo girls posed in matching uniforms with Iconic logos emblazoned on their hot pants. In another, O\u2019Brien stood next to a matte-black Rolls-Royce with the license plate DAMI3N.  By the time Sarao was arrested in April 2015, he had about $50 million tied up in investments around the world, according to people with knowledge of the matter who even now aren\u2019t positive it\u2019s all accounted for. It was only as his lawyers tried to recoup the money that he was forced to face up to the possibility that it was gone. Sarao was released that August after his parents put up the family home as collateral against the bail of 50,000 pounds. In November of last year, following an unsuccessful extradition fight, Sarao flew to Chicago where he pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one of spoofing, which entails placing bids or offers with the intention of canceling them before they\u2019re executed. He was ordered to pay $38.4 million to the CFTC and the Justice Department, which determined that, of the money he made by day trading, only $12.8 million came from cheating the market.  Sarao is scheduled to find out the length of any custodial sentence later this year. In the meantime, he has been allowed to return to Hounslow, where he is banned from trading and, despite pushing 40, placed under the care of his father.  Sarao\u2019s lawyers are no closer to getting their hands on the money beyond about 5 million pounds seized from his trading accounts after his arrest. The CFTC and the Justice Department have joined them in the hunt, according to people close to the situation. The agencies could try to compel banks holding Sarao\u2019s assets to give them up, but that might not be easy because most of the money is outside the U.S. Spokesmen for the CFTC and the Justice Department declined to comment, as did Burlingame, a former Justice Department prosecutor who represents U.K. targets in U.S. investigations.  IXE told Sarao it would return the cash in installments in 2015 and 2016, according to a person familiar with the matter. The deadlines came and went, but no money has been produced. Garcia is rarely seen driving his sports cars around Zurich anymore, according to former associates. In October, German magazine Brand Eins skewered what it portrayed as his outlandish claims about plots of land in Bolivia and Mexico and linked Garcia to Burton Greenberg, who\u2019s serving eight years in a Florida prison for fraud. Former IXE employees interviewed by Bloomberg say that Garcia spent whatever he brought in to fund his own lavish lifestyle and that projections he gave in presentations to Sarao, Baer and others were plucked out of thin air. Still, Garcia\u2019s efforts to acquire a bank continue. In August, IXE announced it was buying Private Investment Bank in the Bahamas from Swiss firm Banque Cramer & Cie. The deal is scheduled to be completed this month. Garcia hasn\u2019t been accused of any wrongdoing. Forcucci, the IXE spokesman, said the company is \"working to return the money in a fair and equitable manner to its investors.\"  Iconic went into liquidation in January 2016. A company hired to advise it on resale options said O\u2019Brien had underestimated the cost of breaking into the online gaming market by about 10 million pounds.  Sarao\u2019s lawyers have been unable to retrieve his investments in Cranwood despite repeated requests, owing to its convoluted offshore ownership structure, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Dupont and MacKinnon said in their e-mail that Wind Energy Scotland has been working to get funds to Cranwood.  From their base in Berkeley Square, the pair last year started another company focused on renewable energy, Celtic Asset Management, which offers \"access to a substantially higher return profile, with less capital at risk.\"  Meanwhile, Sarao is back in his bedroom. The computer that got him into so much trouble is gathering dust in a Washington evidence room. Depending on how much the authorities are able to recoup, he will probably spend the rest of his life paying back the money he owes. If they really want it, they could always lift the trading ban, one associate quips: He\u2019d make it back in no time.  \u2014With assistance from Hugo Miller.", "The theory that humans will eventually be able to upload our brains to computers has fascinated futurists and neuroscientists for years. By transferring our minds into machines we could live forever, unmoored from the feebleness of our physical bodies. The concepts of death and bereavement as we know them now would cease to exist. Currently the idea lives within whitepapers and sci-fi movies, and the only thing (most) researchers agree on is that it won't be possible for a really long time. But while we're far from achieving that pinnacle of immorality, technology in the here-and-now has already started giving us a sliver of eternal life while shaping how we grieve our loved ones if and when they die. The Silicon Valley-startup Eterni.me aims to let people preserve their \"most important thoughts, stories, and memories\" in an artificially intelligent system that could ultimately communicate conversationally with others once its creator is gone. Such an avatar could both soothe the bereaved and allow future generations to know much more about their great-great-grandparents. Since the company had a splashy launch two years ago it has progressed with crypt-like quietness. Their site is mostly unchanged, save for the counter of people signed up for early access that rises each day. But now it says it plans to launch revamped version of its app to a test group in early 2017. The app will connect to a person's Facebook account (with other social integration planned) and launch micro-conversations based on their daily activities. Ultimately that process will build the AI's understanding of its subject, and be able to function like a smarter, more personalized version of the chatbots you can already interact with today. \"We chose this approach because we would like to help people solve the 'blank page syndrome' we have often seen when somebody tries to write in their diary,\" explains Eterni.me founder Marius Ursache. \"We want to encourage people to start curating their digital legacy and we will do that by triggering conversations based on previously collected data of what they did, felt, or experienced.\" Though Eterni.me's new app will be collecting all this information, the neural network backbone won't be able to turn that mass of unruly data into engaging conversations yet. \"The artificial intelligence that we need requires a lot of effort and time \u2014 it may take years,\" Ursache says. \"A lot of the people who expressed interest in Eterni.me don't have this time. This forces us to use more or less the the approach of the cryonics initiatives \u2014 preservation first, technology second.\" Meanwhile, a semblance of the company's vision has already come to \"life.\" Earlier this year, entrepreneur Eugenia Kudya created an AI-powered chatbot in honor of her friend Roman Mazurenko, who died tragically in 2015. Kudya and other mourners could \"speak\" with Roman by talking to the bot or asking it questions \u2014 its responses would be based on the thousands of texts messages and photos she had fed the neural network controlling its artificial intelligence. While the Roman bot couldn't narrate stories in the same way that Eterni.me envisions, it wrote in his voice. Talking to the bot helped Kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend. Inspired by the personal conversations that other people had with Roman's bot, she's now working on Replika, a new product that, like Eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. The bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. Your friends could talk to your Replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you. \"It's all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable,\" Kudya says. \"Now even the first Replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it.\" The goal of the platform, she explains, isn't to let everyone create their own \"Roman\" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of \"friend\" that is there every day to talk to, to make you \"more connected with your friends and yourself.\" But intention or not, a person's Replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that Eterni.me's avatars could. Over 100,000 people have reserved their Replika \"name\" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version. Kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public. The natural progression of Eterni.me or Replika's ideas would be to combine the AI with realistic digital 3D avatars (something Eterni.me eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission). Facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called XXarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy. Long-time VR researcher Jacki Morie coined the phrase \"the ultimate selfie\" to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too. She imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in VR is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after they're gone. \"You'll be scanned and have this 3D construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an AI,\" she says. \"This kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories.\" While the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy \u2014 edging into bizarre \"uncanny valley\" territory \u2014 experts say that, on principle, it's actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved. Heather Servaty-Seib, a grief researcher and Purdue professor says that it's in line with the \"continuing bonds\" theory of bereavement. Death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one. Many already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. (Or through a phone booth, like in Otsuchi, Japan where tsunami survivors \"call\" their lost loved ones.) Facebook allows people to \"memorialize\" the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead. AfterTalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member. DeadSocial allows users to set up a curated Facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once they've passed. They can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave. If people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back? Both Servaty-Seib and grief therapist Dr. Bob Neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients. Still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn. It could be damaging to children, who generally don't fully grasp the concept of death, Servaty-Seib says. Or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says Neymeyer. He's had patients who have listened to the dead's voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave. \"Now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased,\" he says. Beyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor Mark Taubert says that he doesn't think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones. \"I often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, 'Did you ever forgive me for what I did in ....?'\" he says. How could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way? Digital legacy tools like Eterni.me or DeathLogic don't just serve the people left behind. They are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death. These services offer a way for us to build monuments to ourselves. They let us combine our curated memories and experiences with all our messy data \u2014 the texts and tweets and \"Likes\" and photos \u2014 and organize it into something that we hope will let our loved ones and future generations actually understand something about who we were. Until we can really can upload our brains to the cloud, that's our best shot at immortality.", "Fooda, an office lunch service company, surveyed 500 people to find out how Americans are spending their Fooda, an office lunch service company, surveyed 500 people to find out how Americans are spending their lunch breaks It found that, on average, those in media and communications took the longest lunch breaks (approximately 58 minutes) while people in the food and beverage industry took the shortest breaks (30 minutes). \u00a9 Pexels Fooda Infographic Reveals How Americans Spend Their Lunch Breaks According to survey results, 90 percent of people According to survey results, 90 percent of people buy lunch at least once a week, and 85 percent bring lunch more often than they buy it.

Witches and the witch-curious caught global attention after announcing they would come together online to cast \"a spell to bind U.S. President Donald Trump and all those who abet him\" last month. (Though that hasn't stopped his flurry of controversial executive orders that have rocked the globe.)  Still, for these internet-savvy witches, one little spell designed to stop someone from doing harm is just the beginning of their plans for political change. Anyone who watched The Craft in the '90s will be familiar with the concept of a binding spell \u2014 you probably attempted one in high school after trying to make a friend levitate with light as a feather, stiff as a board. Ideally, the spell to bind Trump would have caused a magically-influenced change of heart and cosmic protection for the downtrodden \u2014 and the planet itself.  SEE ALSO: Lana Del Ray calls upon fellow witches to cast spell on Donald Trump Farfetched? Maybe. But this is a long game. As one anonymous group of web-based witches, the Yerbamala Collective, says of their resistance, \"Yerba mala nunca muere.\" Translation: A bad weed never dies.    English occultist Aleister Crowley, in the book Magick and Theory and Practice, defines a witch as someone who believes in and practices magic, or \"the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.\"  If that sounds somewhat political, that's because it is: In 1941, for example, witches gathered to \"hex Hitler.\" Later, in 1967, Beat poet Allan Ginsberg and friends \"exorcised\" the Pentagon. For some who consider themselves witches, to resist is to build spiritual strength and compassion through ritual and discussion. For others, it's about spells cast in private. For still others, the revolution starts with disseminating anti-fascist poetry and casting spells en masse. Old-school methods of street-stomping protests, too, are getting re-witchified.

That\u2019s a different tone from Feb. 17 when the mayor declared on his weekly WNYC \"Ask the Mayor\" segment that Trump is responsible for the rise in threats and vandalism directed against the Jewish community across the nation.  \"The horrible, hateful rhetoric that was used in this election by candidate Trump and by a lot of his supporters directly connects to an increase since the election in anti-Semitic incidents, anti-Muslim incidents, and anti-LGBT incidents,\" de Blasio said. \"It is clear here, and it is clear around the country.\" The anti-Trump claim was undermined on Friday when the FBI, in coordination with the NYPD, arrested leftist journalist Juan Thompson after several threats were made to JCC centers nationwide. Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told reporters at the news conference that Thompson is allegedly responsible for two of eight threats, one on Jan. 28 to a Jewish museum and one on Feb. 22 to the headquarters of Anti-Defamation League. However, Boyce said he believes Thompson is not responsible for the majority of the threats. \"There\u2019s still phone calls coming to JCCs around the country, and we\u2019ll work with our federal partners to identify that person  \u2013 or persons,\" he said.  The Mayor is facing an election in November, and this was his first public event on Staten Island, a county which voted overwhelmingly for Trump. In January, de Blasio attended a private campaign fundraiser on the island. Staten Island Councilman Joe Borelli, who represents the area where the conference took place and is a former New York Trump campaign co-chair, was asked to comment about the Mayor\u2019s statements linking the president to crime incidents.  \"I think the Mayor and I have different worldviews on a lot of things,\" Borelli responded. \"What it comes down to is that the Mayor is certainly not my enemy or even adversary when it comes to standing against hate here on Staten Island or citywide and especially so when it is the JCC in my community.\" \"There\u2019s a push on the left to conflate anti-Semitism with Trump, while at the same time criticizing him for having Jared Kushner, who wears his Jewishness as proudly as anyone, as his most trusted confident and in the highest echelons of the White House staff,\" Borelli told Breitbart News after the Mayor\u2019s press conference. \"It is mind-boggling,\" he said, adding: The mayor and I have a different worldview, for sure, and I am glad to stand with him in response to hate crimes in my community, but we need to be cognizant that a lot of modern anti-Semitism stems from the actions of the UN, the EU, and the global BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] movement, which has taken hold of many on the far left. I just spent a week in Israel and met with both members of the government and the opposition and found there was a tremendous amount of support for President Trump with respect to his Israeli agenda. Since March, there has been over 120 bomb threats nationwide made against Jewish institutions, with last week alone seeing 20 threats throughout the country, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Ninety-five institutions, including a dozen Jewish day schools and multiple ADL offices in New York, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Florida, have been threatened.  \"These are coming in at an unprecedented rate,\" Boyce said. \"We had five this morning and we will handle each one of these investigations.\"  \"New threats are coming in literally as of today, directed at other Jewish Community institutions and this is a very troubling reality,\" de Blasio added.  In New York, media reports say there has been an 113 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017, with a spike of anti-Semitic hate crimes increasing from 19 to 55 incidents over the same period last year. Over the past week, New York has seen a number of threats and swastikas tags in subways, synagogues and Jewish centers. \"Oy Vey, we are coming to spray your synagogue with pig\u2019s blood, the goyim. That\u2019s right you Kikes, take a hike,\" said a voicemail left at a Brooklyn\u2019s East Midwood Jewish Center, according to Gothamist.com.  \"We\u2019ve never seen such a period of concentrated threats against the Jewish community,\" de Blasio said. \"Just the last few weeks are more troubling than anything I\u2019ve seen in many, many years. And I think members of the Jewish community have every reason to be concerned and to be very worried that forces of hatred have been unleashed in our nation.\" Big Government, antisemitic, de blasio, hate crimes", "In case you needed a brief refresher, this was Courtney Love circa 1995 ...

Keep doin' you, Court.", "Premium gas sounds like it\u2019s something special, but it actually translates into paying extra for a higher octane without a performance or fuel economy benefit for many cars. That's what we found after running tests at our 327-acre track. While some cars require premium gas, many others simply carry a recommendation to use it. We wanted to see whether you can save money by using regular gas in cars that merely carry the recommended premium fuel label. Testing at the Consumer Reports Track To find out whether using regular gas in a vehicle that recommends premium gas had any effect on fuel economy or acceleration, we evaluated two models: the 2015 Acura TLX four-cylinder and the 2016 Nissan Maxima V6. Each recommends but does not require that the owner put in premium gas\u2014guidance found on the placard on the backside of their fuel-filler door and often explained in greater detail within the owner\u2019s manual. So long as you fuel the vehicle in accordance with the manual, you are protected by the powertrain warranty. In order to purge the cars of premium that could be in the fuel system, we drove them nearly dry, then ran through a full tank of regular gas before starting testing. All tests were conducted following our stringent fuel economy test protocol, with consumption measured through an inline fuel meter. Both sedans achieved the same fuel economy when tested with regular fuel as with premium. During this testing, the cars felt and sounded the same; we did not experience any engine pinging or knocking noise in either car when using regular fuel. The owner's manuals indicate that you might notice a decrease in performance when running on regular, but our test results say otherwise. The 0-60 mph acceleration times were identical in the TLX and Maxima on regular and premium gas. We contacted Acura and Nissan, asking both why they recommend premium gas. An Acura spokesperson referred us to the TLX\u2019s owner's manual, which states, \"Use of lower octane gasoline can cause occasional metallic knocking noise in the engine and will result in decreased engine performance.\" A Nissan spokesperson wrote in an email that \"it is possible for the same performance to be realized using non-premium fuel.\" But the spokesperson did add that there could be some conditions where performance\u2014which includes fuel economy\u2014might be compromised, such as on extremely hot days. Nissan goes on to say that it is recommended to use premium fuel to guarantee advertised performance. Money in Your Pocket While gas prices remain historically low, the cost difference between regular and premium gas has increased over the past year. In 2015, there was a 39-cent difference between regular and premium, according to fuelgaugereport. But as of this writing, there is a 47-cent difference in the national average price of regular and premium gas. And given the lower pump prices overall, that 8 cents is an even greater percentage. Below we highlight the potential savings using regular instead of premium fuel assuming 12,000 miles per year and current gas prices. Fuel Economy Savings Per Year 30 mpg $188 25 mpg $226 20 mpg $282 15 mpg $376 What's the Downside? So it's okay to use regular even if the manufacturer recommends using premium gas. But check your car owner\u2019s manual before making the switch, and remember that some automakers say premium is required. Wondering about the long-term effects of switching to regular fuel? Here's what we know: In conversations with manufacturers, never was there a connection made with using premium fuel for reliability reasons. The manufacturers only talk about higher octane in terms of performance. What's more, in the Acura owner's manual, Acura only recommends using \"top-tier detergent gasoline\"\u2014which can be of any octane grade, regular or premium\u2014for performance and reliability reasons. But there is nothing in the manual that equates premium gas with improved reliability. That said, if you make the switch and think your car is performing sluggishly, or you hear knocking or pinging, go back to premium fuel. Beyond these test findings, it is key to note our car reliability data consistently show that the most dependable cars tend to be those running on regular fuel.", "Looks like we've been dieting our entire lives... According to Story reporter, Julian Lee. Today marks the first day of a pie- and beer-only diet. The idea of the experiment is to prove there's no special trick to dieting and all that matters is putting in less energy to your body than you use during the day and you will lose weight. For breakfast, lunch and dinner I'll be eating pies only and, on a Friday, I can exchange one pie for three beers, which has a similar amount of calories. Women need less calories than men, who need 2500 calories a day. The pie and beer diet is only 1600 calories a day - two-thirds of what a man needs, which means there will be weight loss.", "Scientist Julian Melchiorri created the world's first man-made, fully working and breathing, leaves. It might be a major key in making Mars an easier and friendlier place to live, since these leaves will make oxygen easier to come by. Not only does it work like a regular leaf, but research shows it's possible for it to be 49% more efficient. All it needs is a little sunlight and water to work. The leaf uses a special silk material that makes it possible for chloroplasts to live and do their thing, and chloroplasts are where the magic of turning CO2 into oxygen happens. Chloroplasts become the engine of the leaves that only need CO2 and sunlight as 'fuel' to run, and emits oxygen as its 'waste.' The engine's process is called photosynthesis, and the chloroplasts of a leaf is where photosynthesis happens. The fact that these silky things can actually carry out the process of photosynthesis with such little effort is what makes them so incredible and useful.", "(CNN) Are you having enough sex? You might have wondered if you should up your bedroom activity after reading about other couples' resolutions to have sex every day or about all the health benefits of getting horizontal . In what might be welcome news for everyone exhausted from work and frazzled from kids, research suggests you don't have to get down every day to reap the rewards of sex, at least in terms of happiness and relationship closeness. \"I do think couples can end up feeling pressure to try to engage in sex as frequently as possible,\" said Amy Muise , a postdoctoral researcher studying sexual relationships at Dalhousie University in Canada. Once a week \"is maybe a more realistic goal to set than thinking you have to have sex everyday and that feels overwhelming and you avoid it,\" said Muise, who is lead author of the study, which was published in November in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. The study found that sex could boost happiness because it makes people feel more satisfied in their relationship, based on survey data from two separate cohorts, including 2,400 married couples in the U.S. National Survey of Families and Households. \"For people in relationships, their romantic relationship quality is one of the biggest predictors of their overall happiness,\" Muise said. \"Having sex more than once a week might not be enhancing that (relationship connection), although it is not bad.\" However, there are a couple of rubs with this research, Muise said. One is that it is not clear which came first, sex or happiness. It may be that people who have sex once a week or more were happier in their relationship and life to begin with, and not that the sex helped make them happy. Or both may be true: Sex enhances happiness and happiness enhances sex. The other catch is that, although a weekly romp might be just what some people need, it might be too much or too little for others. \"Certainly there are couples for whom having sex less frequently will be fine for their happiness, and there are couples who will get increases in happiness if they have sex more than once a week,\" Muise said. What's the right number for you? \"One of the best effects of an article like this (by Muise and her colleagues) is that it opens up conversations with couples\" about their sex life, said Vanessa Marin, a sex therapist based in Berlin. For some couples, the question of how often they should have sex might not have come up, which could be a sign they feel sufficiently close and satisfied -- or that they are just too busy or disconnected to think about it. \"Most couples want to be having more sex and I think this is really a result of how busy and full most of our lives are,\" Marin said. Marin avoids prescribing an amount of sex that couples should have, because every couple is different, and instead recommends couples test it out for themselves. \"I'm a big fan of having clients experiment, like, one month try to have sex twice a week and see how that goes, or once a week, try to play around with it,\" Marin said. As for those lucky couples that are content with how often they get busy under the sheets, one study suggests they may not want to change a thing. Researchers asked couples that were having sex about six times a month to double down on getting down. Couples that doubled their sexual frequency were in worse moods and enjoyed sex less at the end of three months than couples who had stuck to their usual level of bedroom activity. \"Being told you should do something always makes it less fun,\" said George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of the study. That is another reason Marin does not make recommendations to couples about sexual frequency -- for fear they could worry they are not living up to expectations and lose their mojo. However, there's a far bigger relationship problem than couples worrying they aren't having quite enough sex -- \"couples that have pretty much stopped having sex,\" Loewenstein said. For these couples, \"I think once a week is a good final goal. ... It is almost like a natural constant to do it once a week,\" he said. Even if these abstinent couples want to be having more sex, they may lack the desire for their partner. These couples can try conventional strategies, such as scheduling more quality time together or trying a change in scenery. \"What couple has not had the experience that you go to a hotel in a new location in a new environment and the person you're with seems different, and different is good when it comes to sex,\" Loewenstein said. But if these tricks aren't enough, couples may have to appeal to their rational rather than lustful side and tell themselves to just do it. \"These couples might be surprised how enjoyable it would be if they restarted,\" Loewenstein said. Should you schedule your sex? It might sound like the least romantic thing in the world to pencil in sexy time with your partner. But if you and your partner are game to try, there is no reason not to make a sex schedule. \"For some couples, scheduling sex works really well, it gives them something to look forward to, they like the anticipation, they like feeling prioritized,\" Marin said. \"Then other couples (say) scheduling sex feels horrible to them, like sex is transactional and just another item on their to-do list.\" Again, Marin recommends couples experiment with scheduling sex to see if it helps them, as long as neither is opposed to it. A good idea for all couples, whether they like the idea of scheduling sex, is to plan for quality time together -- just the two of them. Ideally, this would be about 20 minutes a day with the TV off and cell phones away, but for extra busy couples, it can help to reserve just five minutes a day for a tete-a-tete, Marin said. This time is also the \"container for sex,\" the time and privacy when sex can be initiated, but you don't have to feel pressure about it, she added. Although scheduling sex can help couples that want to be having sex but just can't find the time, it can make things worse for some. \"If there are relationship issues or psychological issues such as stress or anxiety, then scheduling sex might just add to the pressure,\" said Acacia Parks, associate professor of psychology at Hiram College. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. As for when to schedule the sex, the best time is probably the time when you are least likely to be pulled away by life's obligations. One of the perks of rise-and-shine sex is that testosterone levels are highest in the morning, and this hormone drives sexual desire. On the other hand, tuck-you-in sex could help lull you to sleep, as hormones released during orgasm could help you relax and feel tired. According to Muise, the participants in her research typically reported having sex at night before going to sleep, which is not that surprising. But it has to work for both parties. \"This is another point of negotiation between partners,\" Muise said. \"One of them is just too exhausted. That might be something to play around with, is there a time on the weekend that we could try instead.\"", "Kissing can be many things: sweet, loving, intense, passionate. But did you know it could also benefit your health? Kissing can also be a hormone releaser, a mini-workout and a mood relaxer. Scientists have proven that smooching can trigger a whole spectrum of physiological processes to boost your immunity and improve your connection with your partner. We take you through each one and explain just how beneficial a lip lock can be. 1. IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR TEETH According to dentist Dr Heidi Hausauer, kissing increases saliva flow. This in turn keeps the mouth, teeth and gums healthy by removing food particles. The extra saliva helps to wash bacteria off the teeth and reduce plaque buildup. Some experts even claims that the mineral ions in saliva can promote repair of small lesions in tooth enamel. 2. GIVES IMMUNE SYSTEM A BOOST  Just as saliva can help oral hygiene, it can also give your immune system a boost.  There are more than 700 types of bacteria inside a human mouth - with no two alike.  Therefore, exchanging saliva can introduce the body to new bacteria. Studies have shown that having a diverse amount of bacteria in our bodies correlates with better health - specifically when it comes to our microbiota, or the collection of microorganisms living inside us. A 2014 Dutch study found that a 10-second French kiss can exchange up to 80 million bacteria between us and our partner. And while a single kiss isn't enough to change a person's microbiota, the researchers found that couples who kissed longer had similar microbiota, meaning that they would be better prepared to fight off similar infections and digest similar foods. 3. LOWERS ANXIETY Kissing has been shown to decrease the stress hormone cortisol and increase serotonin - a chemical responsible for maintaining mood balance - levels in the brain.  It has also been shown to have similar benefits to meditation, mainly from its ability to release oxytocin, also known as the 'love' hormone. Oxytocin can act like a psychological buffer and induces a sense of calm and bonding in humans. Experts say we experience a surge of the hormone during orgasm but kind words or a gentle touch can also drive oxytocin levels up. This enhances the experience of what we identify as love and trust. 4. LESSENS ALLERGIC REACTIONS  Dr Hajime Kimata, who specializes in allergology at a clinic in Japan, won an Ig Nobel Prize for revealing how 30 minutes of kissing can reduce the effect of allergic reactions. In 2006, his team studied 24 patients with two types of allergies: mild atopic eczema (a skin allergy) and mild allergic rhinitis (a nasal allergy). The patients were looked at before and after kissing their partners for 30 minutes while listening to soft music. Specifically, they smooched along to Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On with the belief that the soft ballad would set a romantic mood. The researchers found that kissing reduced the body's production of IgE, which is the body's way of reacting to an allergen.  5. LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE Because our lips are made up of blood vessels, kissing can lower blood pressure by dilating them and therefore allowing blood to flow to the vital organs. Plastic surgeon Dr Ryan Neinstein told Glamour: 'The blood is then directed toward the face and away from the rest of the body so the demand on the heart goes down, resulting in lower blood pressure.' As explained above, kissing lowers cortisol levels, which not only lowers anxiety, but also blood pressure. 6. DELAYS SIGNS OF AGING Because kissing increases blood flow to the face, it stimulates the production of collagen - an abundant and important protein found in our bodies, according to Dr Neinstein.  'In order to move your lips, your whole face has to get involved, which increases elasticity,' he said. 'Have you seen face yoga, or facercises? There are yogis, estheticians and dermatologists training women to do exercises for their face to stimulate collagen and reduce the need for a face lift.  'Passionate kissing can lead to firming the face, especially the bottom half of the face.' 7. BURNS CALORIES Depending on which study you look at, kissing can burn anywhere between two and six calories per minute. However, kissing with tongue - which uses all the muscles in your face - can burn up to 26 calories per minute. Andre\u0301a Demirjian, author of Kissing: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about One of Life's Sweetest Pleasures, told CNN it wouldn't compare to a workout session at the gym, but it would still do its job. 'Kissing and lovemaking can be a vigorous exercise if you're fully engaged.You need to have a passionate kiss [in order to burn those calories], but it doesn't have to be a 10-hour makeout session,' she said. Researchers also say we use 30 muscles while kissing, which helps keep your cheeks tight. 8. INCREASES SEX DRIVE Kissing prompts your brain to release a happy elixir of feel-good chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin.  Additionally, testosterone - the hormone responsible for sex drive in both women and men - is released into saliva during prolonged kissing.  'Male saliva has trace amounts of testosterone - and testosterone is an aphrodisiac,' Gallup says. 'So passing saliva during open-mouth kissing over extended periods might help raise her testosterone levels and affect her sex drive,' Dr Gordon Gallup, a psychologist at the University at Albany, told Men's Health. ", "Rob Mrowka, a scientist with the Center for Biological diversity, said the Bundy cattle are essentially \"feral,\" roaming at will over hundreds of thousands of acres \u2014 including far outside the range where long ago they were permitted. (Bundy stopped paying his grazing fees in 1993, meaning the cattle were technically trespassing anywhere on public land after that point.) The area occupied by the cattle is also one of the driest in the U.S., Mrowka said, and the cattle end up out-competing the tortoise for limited food. \"The problem is that the cattle are out there constantly and get first dibs,\" Mrowka added. Bundy is currently behind bars awaiting trial after being arrested in February at Portland airport on charges stemming from his role in the tense 2014 standoff with federal officials near his Nevada ranch. Cliven Bundy\u2019s lawyer Joel Hansen told BuzzFeed News that there are still cattle on the range, and that ranching operations are being run by Bundy\u2019s wife and other women in the family while the rancher awaits trial. Hansen disagreed that cattle harm tortoise habitat. \"The environmentalists say that it\u2019s bad for the tortoise if you have cattle on the land, that\u2019s false,\" Hansen said. \"The tortoises do better with the cattle on the land because they like to make a meal out of the cow pies.

Now, the part-time model is taking legal action. Late last week, Avalos and an unspecified group of other plaintiffs who say their photos were used to make phony accounts filed a $1.5 billion class-action suit against Match.com\u2019s parent company, IAC (InterActiveCorp), in Manhattan federal court, according to the Post. Avalos told The New York Daily News these phony profiles allegedly led to tragedy for one Match.com user. Al Circelli, a 70-year-old Yonkers, N.Y., resident, was reportedly fooled by a fake profile that used Avalos\u2019 modeling pictures. Apparently, \"Aisha\" told Circelli she needed him to send her money to Ghana. Avalos said she was horrified when she discovered her face had played a role in the scam. \"The woman who he thought he was talking to was begging him for money and he finally went broke,\" she told the Daily News. \"He had to borrow money from his son. He went bankrupt. He lost everything.

Blanchflower didn't add that his sentiment applies doubly on occasions like a European Cup final, but then it kind of goes without saying. It's unlikely that many of Liverpool's fans, players or coaching staff will have thought about much other than glory since touching down on Swiss soil ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Europa League final against Sevilla. St. Jakob-Park, the venue for the 2016 Europa League Final Certainly, the idea that Liverpool could directly benefit from losing out on the trophy will be seen as heresy within a club that prides itself on its substantial collection of silverware \u2013 not least when the trophy comes with the considerable addendum of a ticket to next season\u2019s Champions League, something that would single-handedly salvage a desperately mediocre league campaign. And yet, look closely, and those benefits might just be there, staring everyone in the face. Short-term gains Diego Costa, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Willian are just three targets to have declined employment on Merseyside in favour of rubbing shoulders with the continent's cre\u0300me de la cre\u0300me each midweek But first, the common wisdom. Europa League glory, and the resultant promise of Champions League football, would not only boost Liverpool back among Europe\u2019s elite but also provide substantial enticement for any prospective recruits \u2013 especially ones of the calibre to elevate also-rans into hard-nosed competitors. Why else would Marco Reus, for instance, join England\u2019s eighth-best team? It's an incentive that\u2019s regularly incensed Liverpool in recent years: Diego Costa, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Willian are just three targets to have declined employment on Merseyside in favour of rubbing shoulders with the continent's cre\u0300me de la cre\u0300me each midweek. Willian interested the Reds before Chelsea stole the Brazilian late on Similarly, the cash that would land in Liverpool's coffers from UEFA\u2019s broadcasters and prize money fund (Juventus earned themselves \u20ac89m en route to last year\u2019s final) isn\u2019t to be sniffed at. The bigger picture The extra football could certainly harm his players, though. In fact, it already has But while players may be lured to Liverpool by the Champions League, the inverse is also true: the current squad has precisely no in-demand superstars for whom another season outside of the competition would prove too much to bear.

Klopp has already shown himself to be a dab hand on the training ground \u2013 note the sharp upturns in Adam Lallana, Divock Origi and Dejan Lovren since he's arrived \u2013 and so to be granted a week of uninterrupted bibs-and-cones work between league games may well see such improvements become steeper still. MORE LIVERPOOL What Adam Lallana\u2019s Liverpool rebirth can teach us about football Klopp's methods depend on his players' ability to comprehend and carry out what is, to use Liam Neeson parlance, a very particular set of skills. His tactical blueprint is arguably more demanding than most, hinging as it does on his players recognising 'pressing triggers', being able to compress space as a unit, and then marauding forward as quickly and as dangerously as possible \u2013 all en masse and in sync. Such coordinated strategies can only benefit from training-ground practice. Two years: a long time But in practical terms, Liverpool\u2019s 2013/14 campaign was notable for its near-total lack of commitments beyond league fixtures It\u2019s worth remembering, too, the conditions that brought about Liverpool's last title charge. Yes, there was the elevatory stardust of Luis Suarez, and the gladiatorial presence of a fleetingly revitalised Steven Gerrard. But in practical terms, Liverpool\u2019s 2013/14 campaign was notable for its near-total lack of commitments beyond league fixtures: the previous year's seventh-place finish saw the club limbo underneath the Europa League spots, and Brendan Rodgers' men hot-footed it out of both domestics cups by the fifth round. The glorious goal-blitz with which Liverpool stormed the league over that second half-season (once the cups were done with), led by the free-scoring Suarez-Sturridge-Sterling triumvirate, is often looked back on as a kind of inexplicable, unrepeatable marvel; a team of tyros surfing an intangible tidal wave of exuberance all the way to the final stretch. SAS - or Suarez and Sturridge - powered Liverpool to a title challenge But exuberance, spontaneous as it might appear, comes a lot easier after a full week's training \u2013 just ask the current Leicester squad. Claudio Ranieri's men, along with Mauricio Pochettino's and Diego Simeone's, have helped drum home the overriding theme of this season: that the sport\u2019s moneyed giants can be felled by hard-running, high-aggression sides that exceed the sum of their parts. It\u2019s a notion that Klopp, football\u2019s self-styled underdog, fully buys into. That he espouses a similar high-energy, counter-attacking game to the above teams adds weight to the theory that extra hours on the training ground would be of disproportionate value to his side. Ranieri, Simeone and Pochettino have all enjoyed success this season from rivals participation in various competitions Add to the equation the fact that the rebuilding job required by Klopp is not perhaps as colossal as many seem to think: a couple of well-considered embellishments to a squad that already boasts the most elusive of figures \u2013 a world-class centre-forward \u2013 alongside the continued improvement of what\u2019s already there, and who\u2019s to say a title charge (if that\u2019s all there is to concentrate on) couldn\u2019t be viable with a solid pre-season under the belt? Look long Champions League qualification, while it might lure one or two high-pedigree players, will not suddenly bestow Liverpool with a glut of galacticos; either way, next season\u2019s squad will look rather similar to this season\u2019s. And as this term\u2019s league position shows, spreading resources thinly enough to compete in Europe means results can end up being spread pretty thinly too, with outrage-inducing team selections like Rodgers' perceived surrender in the Bernabeu being the alternative. All this is admittedly academic for now. Liverpool head to Basel fully imbued with Blanchflower\u2019s mantra: glory will be the only thing on their minds, as indeed it should. But painting the result as a pivotal moment in Klopp\u2019s project is at odds with the recent experiences of a club whose best season in years came without the competition, and whose one recent campaign in it was an abject disaster. Klopp will be keen to end the first term of his tenure with a trophy Of course, Liverpool is a club than prides itself on its European trophies. But at its heart is a deep longing for the domestic title \u2013 and the strange truth is that missing out on the former could perhaps give them their best shot at the latter.

After a 29-year career in the Army, including three combat tours, he has moved on to a dream job as a fundraiser for a nonprofit -- in Louisville, Kentucky, a city he loves. I can hear the excitement in his voice as he tells me I must visit Louisville. \"You\u2019ve gotta come, dude -- it\u2019s awesome,\" Johnson told me. \"This is an up-and-coming town.\" But Johnson might not have been able to find the job and community of his dreams were it not for Where Opportunity Knox, an innovative new veterans re-integration program. Last year, Johnson was one of more than 100,000 soldiers leaving active duty Army service. Every single one of them passes through Fort Knox before re-entering the civilian world. Those Army veterans are looking for jobs and communities where they can begin a new life as civilians. The greater Louisville, Kentucky, area where Fort Knox is located has a vibrant cultural scene and growing economy in need of capable workers and young families. Visions of America/Getty Images The Louisville, Kentucky, skyline. Until recently, however, there was no coordinated effort to connect the soon-to-be civilians in Fort Knox with job opportunities and communal life in Louisville. So in September 2014, three regional chambers of commerce launched Where Opportunity Knox to try to change that. The program has the enthusiastic backing of the U.S. Army, but it does not take a dime from the government. It relies exclusively on funding from philanthropic foundations. And it has already racked up some impressive numbers. Where Opportunity Knox claims credit for connecting 1,500 veterans to jobs in the region already. And it has the goal of navigating 10,000 veterans to jobs in the greater Louisville area by 2017. Filling A Void The transition to civilian life for soldiers being processed at Fort Knox has two stages, according to retired Col. Walter Herd, the director of the Army\u2019s Transition Assistance Program: preparation for a career outside the Army and connection to opportunities in the civilian world. The Army spends two weeks on the first part, Herd said, helping soldiers with \"everything from their own personal and psychological understanding, to their budgetary needs, culminating with a re\u0301sume\u0301 and job preparation.\" Connecting those soldiers to a career and community is how Where Opportunity Knox complements the Army\u2019s work. Representatives of the group are often on premises at training sessions in Fort Knox to assess soldiers' needs and answer questions. They advertise their availability to talk by email or phone on RallyPoint, an internal military professional networking site. Where Opportunity Knox emphasizes that it is not a job placement program. It just gives veterans the personal support, insight and connections to the employer community that they are less likely to find on, say, Monster.com. In addition to a team of several permanent staff members, Where Opportunity Knox uses a proverbial army of \"regional veteran connectors\" -- 35 trained volunteers -- to help veterans identify job opportunities in the region, and a local community to live in that meets their needs. The latter component means helping veterans identify everything from a quiet neighborhood to buy a home to educational services for children with disabilities to adult recreational sports leagues. I\u2019m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community. Retired Col. Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program Herd said there is no veterans reintegration program in the United States as comprehensive as Where Opportunity Knox. \"The Army does not owe it to a soldier to get them a job, but we believe we do owe it to a soldier to get them ready and get \u2018em introduced to something on the outside so they can at least begin that conversation,\" Herd said. \"The preparation piece is the easy part, the hard part is the connection piece. I\u2019m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community.\" The feeling is mutual. For Kentucky\u2019s business community, Where Opportunity Knox is a portal to a pool of reliable, skilled workers that they say would otherwise be lacking. \"As economic developers, workforce is a challenge,\" said Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant and co-founder of Where Opportunity Knox. \"We have this ongoing problem and certainly now since we\u2019ve gotten past the recession, we\u2019re starting to see growth and we need people with the right skills.\" The population of the greater Louisville area has grown 2.8 percent since 2010 -- in no small part due to its relatively successful recovery from the Great Recession. Unemployment in the Louisville metropolitan area went from a peak of 11.9 percent in February 2010 to 4 percent today. That is a better record than the country as a whole, which went from a peak official jobless rate of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5 percent today. Daniel Marans Retired Col. Walter Herd is director of the Army's Transition Assistance Program. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis points to the greater Louisville area as a model for successful diversification of what was once a primarily industrial economy. The city and surrounding areas now also boast a thriving service sector. Louisville proper is home to UPS\u2019 Worldport air hub, as well as two Ford production plants and the corporate headquarters of health insurance giant Humana. And while the city is known for its bourbon distilleries -- think Maker\u2019s Mark, Woodford Reserve and Evan Williams -- it is also the base of Yum! Brands, parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Army veterans are ideal candidates for the mid- and high-skill jobs that make the region\u2019s businesses tick, Herd and Pickett insist. For one thing, a person must be healthy, free of a criminal record and have completed high school to get into the Army in the first place. Soldiers then learn concrete skills in the Army that often translate into civilian occupations -- everything from truck driving to supply chain management to computer science. But more valuable than the skills the Army teaches soldiers are the \"attributes\" that service instills, Herd said. Soldiers are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline, a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their feet before they emerge from Fort Knox\u2019s walls to return to the civilian world. And those are often the intangible qualities that make people reliable employees and innovators. \"The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they\u2019re healthy, they stay out of trouble,\" Herd said. \"So we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few years and then we give them back to society.\" The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they\u2019re healthy, they stay out of trouble. Retired Col. Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program The Visit To An Army Base That Inspired A New Initiative Pickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of Fort Irwin, the Army\u2019s training center in California. There she saw the life-size replicas of entire towns in Afghanistan and Iraq that soldiers trained in before being deployed to war zones overseas. It is the crucible that turns young high-school graduates into hardened adults, ready to face unknown physical and mental challenges in a foreign nation. \"What was so striking to me -- this was really my first kind of up close with the military -- I remember this captain who told us, their job is to make every soldier that comes through there have their worst day in the service happen at Fort Irwin so it doesn\u2019t happen somewhere else,\" Pickett said. To Pickett, it was obvious that any soldiers that underwent training at that base -- let alone the experiences that followed -- would make for terrific employees and members of the community. If they could make it through Fort Irwin, wouldn\u2019t they make a superb supply chain manager for UPS? \"I wish every American could go through there,\" Pickett said. \"I was just inspired by it.\" Daniel Marans Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant, co-founded Where Opportunity Knox. Translating \"Army-Speak\" To \"Corporate-Speak\" Given how intuitively appealing these veterans sound as employees, one would think veterans would have a relatively low unemployment rate. But unemployment among young, post-9/11 veterans has been higher than among their non-veteran peers. In 2014, the unemployment rate among post-9/11 veterans was 7.2 percent, compared with 6 percent among non-veterans. For post-9/11 veterans ages 18 to 24, the jobless rate was 16.2 percent, compared with 12.5 percent among non-veterans of the same age. (The figures have since declined, but on the advice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy.) The reasons are complicated. The high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans no doubt plays a role -- though that may be more due to employers\u2019 stigmas about the conditions than their actual effects. There are other factors, however, that have more to do with the military\u2019s separation from civilian society. The networks that soldiers rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world. As a result, it is hard to make professional connections with peers in the civilian world that are so essential to finding a job in today\u2019s economy. Herd believes that departing soldiers are also sometimes unsure how to present the broader attributes they acquire in the military as professional assets in the civilian world. The hard part comes in translating those skills from Army/Navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable. Kathy Robinson, founder, Turning Point Kathy Robinson, founder of TurningPoint, a Boston-based career counseling firm, and a former human resources executive, has worked alongside veterans, recruited them to work for companies and advised them on finding work. \"Veterans bring a lot to the table when it comes to collaboration, ability to assess a vision and execute on that vision. When I was working with veterans they were often the most effective people in their jobs,\" Robinson said. \"The hard part comes in translating those skills from Army/Navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable.\" In fact, those with the most easily translatable skills often have a harder time realizing the value of the attributes they have honed in the military -- let alone communicating them in terms employers can easily grasp. Herd notes that machine gunners and infantrymen, who worked in positions that do not exist in the civilian world, are less likely to be unemployed than Army truck drivers, who can easily become civilian truck drivers. Fred Johnson Fred Johnson volunteers with Healing and the Arts to help younger veterans cope with PTSD. \"You Can Actually See The Community Change.\" Johnson, the Army vet, sees another challenge in the transition to civilian life. Like many veterans, Johnson wanted a job that provided him with a sense of purpose like the kind he enjoyed in the Army. Given Johnson\u2019s worries about the applicability of his Army skills in the civilian world altogether, he did not think he would have the luxury of finding a job that fit that description. That was before he met with the folks at Where Opportunity Knox. They told him about an opening at Fund for the Arts, a Louisville nonprofit that raises money for arts supplies and programs in Louisville\u2019s underprivileged schools. Johnson is now the organization\u2019s director of workplace giving. \"I had a certain idea in mind for what I wanted to do and they helped me work through that,\" Johnson said. \"They helped me learn how to go through the civilian interview process. I knew what I wanted and they helped me articulate that in a way that made sense.\" Through his work at Fund for the Arts, Johnson sees himself as part of a process of community building in the underserved west side of Louisville. He compares it to the reconstruction work he did in the Iraqi city of Baquba after the Army brigade he led helped conquer it. I tell them, 'Follow your heart, not the money.' You can actually see the community change. Fred Johnson, Army veteran and director of workplace giving, Fund for the Arts \"When we attacked that city it was like a wasteland,\" Johnson said. \"Then we helped rebuild the city. We are trying to do that here in Louisville. On the west side, it is almost barren -- it almost reminds me of Baquba.\" In addition to the Army instilling in him a desire to be a part of something greater than himself, Johnson said his service equipped him with communication skills and a comfort with diversity of all kinds. Both of those characteristics are assets to him in his fundraising work. \"The vast majority of people in the Army -- unless you don\u2019t do your work, who cares? Same thing with a female, a gay person, or any ethnic or racial minority,\" Johnson added. \"The west side [of Louisville] is very poor and racially diverse. I fit in as well there as at Humana or Brown-Forman where everybody is wearing suits.\" But Johnson said he was also fortunate that Fund for the Arts was willing to give him an opportunity to prove himself despite his lack of formal fundraising experience -- and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"I told [Fund for the Arts CEO] Christen Boone, this is what [my PTSD] means and this is what I am doing to overcome it,\" Johnson said. \"I said I am bringing more positive baggage than negative. She took a chance on me. I wish more CEOs and executives had the courage.\" And prove himself Johnson has. Local magazine Business First recently named him one of Louisville\u2019s top 20 veterans in business. Now Johnson is using his experience to help younger returning veterans find their way. He volunteers with a joint civilian-military initiative called Arts and Healing. The group uses art to help veterans cope with PTSD. \"I tell them, \u2018Follow your heart, not the money,\" Johnson said. \"You can actually see the community change.\" Where Opportunity Knox helped give Johnson the confidence that the skills he acquired in the Army had prepared him well for a civilian career. He explains to younger veterans that they too have attained those skills, even if they do not yet know it. \"A lot of time the younger kids do not realize what they\u2019ve learned,\" he observed. \"They are 21 years old -- I say, \u2018No, dude, you experienced a lifetime in that short span. You just don\u2019t realize how many tools you have.\u2019\"", "The only schmear, political or otherwise, that President Obama is interested in is the one on his bagel.

(NJ.com) Anthony Senatore never disputed leaving his rifle under his bed, unsecured and loaded. The New Jersey father pleaded guilty in 2014 to child endangerment after his 4-year-old son accidentally used the gun to shoot and kill Brandon Holt, a 6-year-old neighbor, at Senatore\u2019s Toms River home, according to NJ.com. More than three years after the shooting, a judge had to do the unthinkable: Determine how much the child\u2019s death was worth monetarily to the people who loved him most \u2014 his parents. The answer: $572,588.26 That\u2019s how much was awarded Monday to Christine and Ronald Holt in a wrongful-death suit the couple brought against their former neighbors, Anthony and Melissa Senatore, according to NJ.com. The calculation, the site reported, was based on several factors that included the future companionship Brandon would have provided his family, as well as \"his pain and suffering before his death and for the family\u2019s unpaid medical and funeral expenses.\" The judgment also included punitive damages, in an amount that hasn\u2019t been determined. \"On April 9, 2013, we had to watch my sweet, beautiful, 6-year-old boy take his last breath,\" Christine Holt told a judge during a sentencing hearing in 2015, according to the Asbury Park Press. \"We used to imagine what he would be like when he got older and grew up.

So far in 2016, at least 95 children younger than 18 have picked up a firearm and accidentally shot themselves or someone else, according to data from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control group funded by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. The advocacy group, which compiles shooting data using news reports, found that 278 such shootings occurred in 2015. An Everytown analysis of publicly reported gun deaths from December 2012 to December 2013 found that \"at least 100 children were killed in unintentional shootings \u2014 almost two each week\" during that time \u2014 the same period during which Brandon Holt was fatally shot in New Jersey. \"These aren\u2019t accidents,\" Everytown says. \"They\u2019re preventable. More than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them.\" The boys were playing a \"pretend shooting\" game at the Senatore home when the family\u2019s preschooler fired one shot that struck Brandon Holt in the head from about 15 yards away, according to NJ.com. He was rushed to a hospital, where he died the next day, according to the Asbury Park Press. During this week\u2019s court appearance, Anthony Senatore testified that he was only 10 feet away when his son fired the fatal shot. \"When the gun went off, I turned around and realized what gun it had been,\" Senatore said, according to video published by the Press. \"I immediately removed it from his hands and threw it into my garage up on my work bench. With that, I was going back to discipline him when my daughter had came running around the side of the building and said, \u2018Dad, dad, Brandon was shot.'\" [\u2018My 4-year-old gets jacked up to target shoot,\u2019 mom brags hours before he shoots her] Senatore\u2019s attorney, Robert Ebberup, told the paper last year that his client \u2014 a sportsman who hunts and fishes \u2014 had originally removed the rifle from a gun locker after hearing a noise in the middle of the night. Senatore testified that the weapon was wrapped in a towel and loaded at the time, according to the Press. The gun was under the bed for months. \"He left that gun under his bed for what he thought would be a couple of days, just in case that noise was an intruder trying to come into his house,\" Ebberup said. \"However, he forgot that it was there \u2014 and we know the rest.\" Senatore previously told the Press that he is \"not a monster,\" but acknowledged that he\u2019ll be haunted by what happened for as long as he lives. \"Each and every one of us have hobbies and other recreational activities that we pursue,\" he said. \"I am no different than any other person in that respect, but for one horrible mistake, one terrible lapse in judgment, which will define the remainder of my days.\" And yet, the rifle wasn\u2019t the only weapon that was left unsecured in the Senatore home, according to NJ.com. During a court appearance in 2014, Atlantic County Prosecutor Jim McClain said Senatore also kept multiple shotguns in the house, including a Remington 12-gauge and two Harrington & Richardsons. The weapons were placed near ammunition, the prosecutor said, in a household with three children aged 12, 8 and 4. [\u2018A child who commits first-degree murder cannot be willy-nilly turned loose into society\u2019] Senatore was sentenced in February 2015 to serve three years in prison, according to NJ.com. He was released on parole after serving nine months. Before he was sentenced, Senatore told a judge he accepted his role in Brandon Holt\u2019s death, according to the Press. \"The events of April 8, 2013, have left a permanent mark in the life of two families who could not have imagined that such a horrific event would occur,\" he said. \"Although I will be sentenced this morning to a term of imprisonment, the torment of these thoughts will occupy me throughout my existence on this earth.\" He added: \"Brandon played with my own three children regularly and was a guest in my home on many occasions, including many times for dinner. We considered him part of our family. I cannot begin to fathom the loss of any of my children. Therefore, I cannot imagine the depth of pain and sorrow that Ron and Christine experience on a daily basis.\" Christine Holt attempted to explain her pain in the same hearing last year, according to the Press. Holt said at the time that she was plagued by feelings of guilt. \"I still deal with it every day, that I couldn\u2019t protect him, I couldn\u2019t save him,\" she said. \"I would have done anything to be able to.\" The judge imposing the prison sentence noted that the shooting dealt a crushing blow to two families. \"Both sides are in great pain and are deeply suffering,\" he said, according to the Press. On Monday, in announcing the judgment, Superior Court Judge Robert E. Brenner scolded Anthony Senatore. \"To leave this rifle under the bed for five or six months, in this court\u2019s mind, is an act of willful or wanton disregard of the rights of another,\" the judge said, according to the Press. \"There were children in the house.\" Outside the Ocean City Courthouse, after the Holts were awarded $572,588.26, the slain boy\u2019s grandmother, Donna Elefante, declared: \"The money is not going to bring Brandon back.\" Asked by a reporter after the ruling if she could forgive Anthony Senatore, Christine Holt shook her head. \"I don\u2019t know if I can answer that,\" she said, noting that the ruling was about more than money. \"It\u2019s justice and it\u2019s also awareness,\" Brandon Holt\u2019s mother added. \"I just want everyone to know \u2014 just lock up your guns. Just lock up your guns.\" There appears to be no statistics keeping track of how many U.S. children fire a gun and intentionally or unintentionally harm someone. Yet, for many it feels like a month doesn't go by that we don't hear about a child pulling the trigger and killing someone with a firearm. These incidents have added fuel to the gun control debate.

Can you stream Mr Robot on Netflix? When will seasons 1 and 2 of Mr Robot be on Netflix? All will be revealed as we take a look at the deals surrounding USA Networks juggernaut show and determine its status on Netflix in the US and abroad. Mr Robot was one of the best shows to debut in 2015. Period. It\u2019s emphasis on technology, big business and subject matter as a whole as never been more relevant and with pleasing visuals, impressive acting from everyone and plot twists you never see coming, it makes for great television that everyone should be watching. We follow Elliot, an anti-social computer genius who is in a boring life grinding away in the system. He joins a force that is attempting to break the cycle and get the truth out. As I say, the show is brilliant and is actually not given the full credit it\u2019s deserved. It\u2019s a masterpiece. With season 2 rolling around in 2016, we\u2019ve been asked loads about the status of Mr Robot on Netflix and the news isn\u2019t so great I\u2019m afraid. For those in the US, you\u2019ve probably noticed that as of right now, the season 1 or 2 of Mr Robot cannot be found streaming. The first step to look at why Mr Robot isn\u2019t on Netflix is to see the network. USA Network, while not completely new, is relatively new and while some of their content (mainly third party titles) are available on Netflix, their first party library is pretty much vacant. This is a similar stance the cable giant HBO has, refusing to add its shows to Netflix. So if you can\u2019t watch on Netflix, what options do you have? Thankfully that\u2019s easy to answer. As of the time or writing, you can watch the entirety of season 1 on Hulu for free and it\u2019s available as part of your Amazon Prime subscription too. Looking abroad, Amazon Prime in the majority of regions have the show locked up and therefore won\u2019t be coming to Netflix, particularly given the shows popularity. It really sucks that some of the best shows out there at the moment, Game of Thrones, Modern Family and Mr Robot are all vacant from Netflix but as always, if anything changes, we\u2019ll let you know here on What\u2019s on Netflix.", "Republican presidential nominee Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has offered a litany of racist comments, which it turns out may be rooted in his deeper belief in the inherent superiority of some people \u2015 and not others.

But for me, and thousands of other women like me, it is the reason we have to work harder to be able to earn, succeed, and claim our power like men can. Two years ago, I was working as the director of operations of a research institute at a major university while finishing my MBA in the evenings. When I got pregnant, I assumed combining motherhood with my professional life would be easy. I also assumed I would have access to paid maternity leave.  While I had worked full-time for over two years, I was originally hired as a consultant and had only been an official employee for 23 months \u2014 one month shy of qualifying for six weeks paid leave. In this, I was far from alone: just another one of the 88% of women in the U.S. who don\u2019t have access to paid maternity leave.  When I got pregnant, I assumed combining motherhood with my professional life would be easy. I also assumed I would have access to paid maternity leave. I was, however, entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). I was lucky. Approximately 60% of employees \u2014 those who work full-time for at least one year for a company with at least 50 staff members \u2014 are eligible for unpaid leave. The remaining 40% are not guaranteed any time off, paid or unpaid. Not even one single day to give birth. I worked for a professor who travelled frequently and whom I rarely saw in person. Many of our staff members were located at campuses abroad, and much of our work was done via Skype. I had worked remotely from rural Ghana many times before, and could have easily worked from my apartment. When I first discussed flexible working and telecommuting, my boss was open to the idea. As my due date neared, he changed his mind. I started to visit day care centers in Manhattan, and was shocked to learn that monthly rates were anywhere from $1,900 to $2,900. In fact, in 28 states and the District of Columbia, the average annual cost for an infant in day care is higher than a year\u2019s tuition and fees at a four-year public college.  Fees for two children in day care are higher than the average annual rent in every state. I added my name to a number of waitlists, and was eventually offered a part-time place at one center. My boss still would not consider a flexible work schedule, and my daughter, now 2 years old, is still waiting on that full-time list. I worked until my water broke, trying to save the little paid sick and vacation time that I had. After 23 hours of labor, my daughter was born via an emergency c-section. I took my baby home and was grateful that I at least had the time to recover. Giving birth is a physically grueling event, and too many women are forced to go back to work while they\u2019re still bleeding, have stitches, and can barely walk. I worked until my water broke, trying to save the little paid sick and vacation time that I had. Over the next 12 weeks, I had regular panic attacks at the thought of handing my baby over to strangers. At three months, she wasn\u2019t sleeping through the night, had only had one round of vaccines, was nursing every hour, and still very much needed me. As much as I loved my job, I chose to resign.  In that, too, I was far from alone. For the first time since the women\u2019s liberation movement of the 1970s, the share of mothers who choose to stay at home rather than return to work after their children are born has been increasing \u2014 it has now reached 29%. While 71 countries provide paid paternity leave, there are only two countries that don\u2019t offer any paid federal maternity leave: the United States and Papua New Guinea.  Like many women who find themselves stifled by this country's inflexible work options, I wanted to work. But I couldn\u2019t justify leaving my infant. So, when my daughter was a year old, I finished my MBA, left the city, and moved my family to Long Island, so we could be closer to my mom, who was able to help out. We knew we wanted to have another baby but still wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to spend $5,000 a month on day care. I also still wouldn\u2019t be ready to leave our second baby at just 12 weeks. I was terrified that I was giving up my career that I worked so hard to build terrified that I wouldn\u2019t be able to find consulting work from home, that there would be a break in my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I was worried that I would eventually be \"mommy-tracked,\" viewed only as someone\u2019s mommy, rather than as a serious professional. While staying home with our daughter \u2014 and now infant son \u2014 was the best decision I could have made, I still lost out financially. I was lucky enough to find consulting work from home in my field, and I can run down from my office to nurse my babies anytime my mother calls, but I lost retirement contributions, paid sick and vacation leave, as well as the social aspect of grabbing a cup of coffee with a colleague without a demanding, sticky little human hanging off my body. I was terrified that I was giving up my career that I worked so hard to build that there would be a break in my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Our country\u2019s antiquated parental leave policy dates back to when men were the sole breadwinners who could easily support a family while women stayed home to care for the children. It ignores the fact that today two incomes are usually needed to make ends meet, that many women enjoy their careers, and that even when working full-time, women spend twice as much time as men do on child care.  Studies have repeatedly shown that paternity leave helps fathers bond with their infants and take more responsibility in child care. It also promotes gender equality and helps keep women connected to the workforce and contributing to the economy.  It\u2019s time for the U.S. to catch up to the rest of the world, and provide paid parental leave \u2014 for both mothers and fathers. Our children deserve the best starts in life, and parents shouldn\u2019t be forced to choose between caring for their infants and financially providing for them.", "Millennials get bad a rap, especially when it comes to their workplace reps. Gen X and Baby Boomer managers tend to judge millennials harshly for their work style and expectations and are often left wondering: \"What do millennials really want at work anyway?\" According to a 2014 study by IBM\u2019s Institute for Business Value, they want the same things we all do. In fact, it turns out there are minimal differences between millennials and other generations when it comes to career aspirations. IBM researchers looked at 1,784 employees from 12 countries and six industries. The survey revealed that as many millennials want to make a positive impact at their workplace as their Generation X and Baby Boomer counterparts. Researchers also concluded that while millennials' \"digital proficiency\" sets them apart, they share similar attitudes with other generations around career, goals, recognition, engagement and leadership styles. By 2020, millennials will make up half of the American workforce so it's time to give up the blame game and start working together. We can and should leverage the unique gifts this group brings to the workplace and ride the wave known as \"millennial momentum\" to business success. Here are five lessons you can learn from your millennial colleagues: 1. Pay people with what motivates them Millennials appreciate diversity and understand that people aren't one size fits all. And like many workers today, they aren\u2019t always motivated by bags of money. The work of Harvard University psychologist David McClelland on social motives taught us that we all have innate needs that drive us in our work lives. I use the four motivators of motivational currency: performance, people, power, and purpose. Successful motivational leadership is about being able to recognize primary motivations, read what motivates your team and lead with intention so you can motivate others quickly and efficiently. 2. Don\u2019t be afraid to disrupt things Disruption is the new innovation, and millennials have the confidence to ask the right questions that lead to innovative products and approaches. They're persistent and they won\u2019t simply stop at the first solution to a problem. But it's important to remember that disruption isn't about \"blowing things up\" just for the sake of it. It's about being open to change. A smart approach I learned from a millennial leader is to allow talent to pitch an innovative idea and then try it out internally to see if it has potential. The point is to not stifle the flow of ideas because that only stifles progress. 3. Use technology wisely, but not exclusively Contrary to popular opinion, millennials aren\u2019t digital addicts who want to share everything on Snapchat and Instagram. You may be surprised to learn that while they\u2019re great at navigating the digital landscape, they actually prefer face-to-face communication so sit down and have a conversation. That said, millennials know how to find information and create a buzz, so start seeking, whether it\u2019s an app you've never heard of or business strategy you haven't used before. 4. Don't worry, be happy (it's healthy!) I know I am wired to worry and so are many of the Fortune 500 executives I work with. What I've learned is that millennials are better at connecting with people than problems. I recently talked to a hedge fund manager who has over $20 billion in assets under management, and yet he's still worried about making money. At some point there is a diminishing return on our worry investment. The lesson from millennials: Be driven when you need to be and enjoy the ride when and while you can. 5. Make excellence an expectation Instead of seeing millennials as entitled, look at it this way: Millennials believe they are destined for excellence. That desire for success, combined with guidance from you on how to navigate workplace challenges, is a stellar business strategy. While it\u2019s effective to give clear feedback to someone who isn\u2019t pulling his weight, it is not a smart business practice to vilify an entire generation. Labels limit innovation so lose them. Get out of the habit of talking about what millennials don\u2019t do. Instead, find ways to build on what millennials naturally do. Engage in conversations about what their signature strengths are, what motivates them and the ideas they have. The return on your investment will pay dividends for yourself, your people and your business.", "This couple is getting press for some scary death threats they received, but the kicker is the reason that they got them.

But if you fail to do these two simple things, it can create quite the beautiful disaster. On this week's beauty list, celebrities show us how not to wear eyeshadow. R&B singer Chante\u0301 Moore and actress Rosario Dawson went overboard with Crayola-colored eye makeup. Meanwhile, \"Pretty Little Liars\" star Ashley Benson's smokey eye could have used way less shimmer. Learn from these celebrity eyeshadow mistakes below (and see which stars nailed it with their hair and makeup). BEST: Kate Winslet Winslet's tousled, blonde hair gives her sexy red dress casual flair. And her simple makeup is a breath of fresh air on the red carpet. BEST: Shailene Woodley This is probably the most makeup we've seen the \"Divergent\" star sport, but the hint of eyeshadow, liquid eyeliner and black mascara is just enough. BEST: America Ferrera Ferrera has us floored with her lush waves, peachy cheeks and apricot lip gloss. This is the perfect spring makeup! BEST: Lucy Hale There is nothing prettier than a well-done braid, and Hale's thick side plait allows us to see her stunning face. BEST: Lea Michele This look just screams, \"Dewy, glowy skin!\" Michele's complexion is positively glowing and we can't stop staring at her bold brows and lashes.

WORST: Chante\u0301 Moore Moore looks like she is stuck in the '80s with this curly, undercut hairstyle, dramatic purple eye makeup and hot pink lipstick. WORST: Ashley Benson This \"Pretty Little Liars\" star could have scaled back (all the way back) on the shimmering eyeshadow and blush. And it would have been nice to see her with a sleek updo to balance out her menswear-inspired outfit. WORST: Jenna Ushkowitz Ushkowitz's heavy blue-gray eyeshadow makes her eyes appear smaller, and it takes away from her natural beauty.

Nvidia (NVDA, Tech30), a company most well known for graphics processing chips used for video games, has also developed the Drive PX autonomous car computer and Drive CX digital cockpit. Nvidia's technology also powers in-car navigation and entertainment systems. Honda (HMC), Daimler's Mercedes Benz, Volvo and Tesla (TSLA) are some of Nvidia's bigger automotive partners. Autos are still a small business for Nvidia, but it is growing rapidly. Sales from its car customers surged 75% last year. And the company said in its latest annual report that its automotive technology, which is currently in more than 10 million cars, offers processing power greater than 150 Macbook Pro notebooks. Investors are getting behind the wheel too. Nvidia's stock surged nearly 65% in 2015 and is up another 34% so far this year. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang has been a bit of an evangelist for autonomous cars. He's appeared at tech conferences with Tesla CEO Elon Musk to discuss them -- and proudly tweeted about his new Model X last year. Love my new rocket! Congrats, Elon and the @TeslaMotors and NVIDIA teams. - Jen-Hsun Huang pic.twitter.com/KXdkuSMr3j \u2014 NVIDIA (@nvidia) October 27, 2015 Nvidia will face tough competition in the market though -- most notably from chip company Mobileye (MBLY). Semiconductor giants Intel (INTC, Tech30), Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30) and Texas Instruments (TXN) are also dipping their toes in the autonomous car waters. Earlier this year, Intel bought an Italian company called Yogitech, which is working on making driverless cars safer. But the good news for Nvidia is that even as it looks to become a bigger player in autonomous cars, its core business is still doing quite well. Revenue from its gaming chips unit surged more than 35% last year. That division accounts for 56% of Nvidia's total sales. And that appears to be the main reason why Nvidia is thriving while Mobileye, which is more of a pure play on driveless tech, has been struggling lately. GM (GM), Nissan (NSANF), BMW and Hyundai (HYMTF) are four of Mobileye's biggest customers. Shares of Mobileye are down 13% this year and 23% over the past 12 months, in part due to fears of increased competition. Still, the self-driving market may be big enough for more than one player, especially since auto companies aren't the only ones building autonomous cars. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) is developing self-driving vehicles and rumors are running rampant that Apple (AAPL, Tech30) also has a car in the works. So there may be enough wealth to spread around for Mobileye, Nvidia and other developers of what will wind up being the guts of self-driving cars.", "Or, you know, any day that you exercised, had sex, masturbated, or moved enough that you got at all sweaty below the belt, Dr. Darius Paduch, urologist and male sexual medicine specialist at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, tells BuzzFeed Life.

MIRED! \u00a9 Provided by The Huffington Post The paragraph in question, which was noticed by a content editor at The paragraph in question, which was noticed by a content editor at Mic , reads: With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. The problem is with the name \"Luke\" in the phrase, \"She is desperate to find her brother Luke.\" The name doesn\u2019t have any commas around it, making it information that\u2019s essential to the sentence. But the only reason it\u2019d be essential is if Leia had more than one brother and Luke\u2019s name had to be specified. Yeah, that\u2019s pretty heavy. If Luke was Leia\u2019s only brother, as we all believe, there would be commas around the name because it\u2019s nonessential, i.e., the sentence has the same meaning without it. The comma exclusion implies that Leia has more brothers \u2015 perhaps some missing sibling we haven\u2019t met.

The NSO Group\u2019s spyware finds ways around encryption by baiting targets to click unwittingly on texts containing malicious links or by exploiting previously undiscovered software flaws. It was taking advantage of three such flaws in Apple software \u2014 since fixed \u2014 when it was discovered by researchers last month. The cyberarms industry typified by the NSO Group operates in a legal gray area, and it is often left to the companies to decide how far they are willing to dig into a target\u2019s personal life and what governments they will do business with.

Credit NSO Group Since it is privately held, not much is known about the NSO Group\u2019s finances, but its business is clearly growing. Two years ago, the NSO Group sold a controlling stake in its business to Francisco Partners, a private equity firm based in San Francisco, for $120 million. Nearly a year later, Francisco Partners was exploring a sale of the company for 10 times that amount, according to two people approached by the firm but forbidden to speak about the discussions. The company\u2019s internal documents detail pitches to countries throughout Europe and multimillion-dollar contracts with Mexico, which paid the NSO Group more than $15 million for three projects over three years, according to internal NSO Group emails dated in 2013. \"Our intelligence systems are subject to Mexico\u2019s relevant legislation and have legal authorization,\" Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement. \"They are not used against journalists or activists. All contracts with the federal government are done in accordance with the law.\" Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said that the sale of its spyware was restricted to authorized governments and that it was used solely for criminal and terrorist investigations. He declined to comment on whether the company would cease selling to the U.A.E. and Mexico after last week\u2019s disclosures. For the last six years, the NSO Group\u2019s main product, a tracking system called Pegasus, has been used by a growing number of government agencies to target a range of smartphones \u2014 including iPhones, Androids, and BlackBerry and Symbian systems \u2014 without leaving a trace. Among the Pegasus system\u2019s capabilities, NSO Group contracts assert, are the abilities to extract text messages, contact lists, calendar records, emails, instant messages and GPS locations. One capability that the NSO Group calls \"room tap\" can gather sounds in and around the room, using the phone\u2019s own microphone. Pegasus can use the camera to take snapshots or screen grabs. It can deny the phone access to certain websites and applications, and it can grab search histories or anything viewed with the phone\u2019s web browser. And all of the data can be sent back to the agency\u2019s server in real time. In its commercial proposals, the NSO Group asserts that its tracking software and hardware can install itself in any number of ways, including \"over the air stealth installation,\" tailored text messages and emails, through public Wi-Fi hot spots rigged to secretly install NSO Group software, or the old-fashioned way, by spies in person. Much like a traditional software company, the NSO Group prices its surveillance tools by the number of targets, starting with a flat $500,000 installation fee. To spy on 10 iPhone users, NSO charges government agencies $650,000; $650,000 for 10 Android users; $500,000 for five BlackBerry users; or $300,000 for five Symbian users \u2014 on top of the setup fee, according to one commercial proposal. You can pay for more targets. One hundred additional targets will cost $800,000, 50 extra targets cost $500,000, 20 extra will cost $250,000 and 10 extra costs $150,000, according to an NSO Group commercial proposal. There is an annual system maintenance fee of 17 percent of the total price every year thereafter. What that gets you, NSO Group documents say, is \"unlimited access to a target\u2019s mobile devices.\" In short, the company says: You can \"remotely and covertly collect information about your target\u2019s relationships, location, phone calls, plans and activities \u2014 whenever and wherever they are.\" And, its proposal adds, \"It leaves no traces whatsoever.\"", "The Detroit home where Eminem spent part of his childhood burned in a blaze Thursday, just days after a woman reportedly offered to purchase it and turn it into a museum dedicated to the rapper. Firefighters responded to battle the fire at the small, two-story bungalow just south of 8 Mile Road at 6:20 p.m., the Detroit Free Press reports. The boarded-up home was on a street with numerous other vacant homes and overgrown yards. According to the Associated Press, an immediate cause wasn't known for the fire that damaged the top floor of the house. A Detroit Free Press video shows some of the aftermath: The house will look familiar to fans of the Detroit MC. It appears on the cover of Eminem's 2000 release \"The Marshall Mathers LP,\" and makes a comeback on the cover of \"The Marshall Mathers LP 2,\" released this week. The vacant house has been up for auction through the Michigan Land Bank for months with an apparent minimum bid of $1. But just Monday, MLive reported a Tennessee woman was in the process of bidding on the home, though her offer had not yet been accepted by the Michigan Land Bank. The news site describes 28-year-old Shelly Hazlett as an \"avid Eminem fan\" who wanted to turn it into a museum dedicated to the rapper. Before falling into disrepair, the home belonged to Eminem's mother for several years, according to records obtained by the Detroit Free Press. In her book My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem, Deborah Mathers spoke fondly of the house at 19946 Dresden St. \"Marshall loved it so much that he had a model of it made to take on tour with him,\" she wrote. \"Even though we'd moved a lot, he always said the house on Dresden was his childhood home.\" You can see Eminem walking on a dark street past the boarded-up house at the end of his video for \"Survival,\" starting at minute 4:06.

But sometimes discomfort is due to doing nothing whatsoever. Case in point: Sitting at your sedentary desk job. Spending too much time sitting has been linked to a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, metabolic syndrome and earlier death, and even the most dedicated of exercise regimens won't undo all the damage. \"We were built to move,\" Steven Conway, Ph.D., a chiropractor and attorney in Athens, Wisconsin, and a spokesperson for the American Chiropractic Association, tells The Huffington Post. \"The non-moving is the hardest thing on us.\" Most of us can probably recall a time when our backs ached or our heads pounded after a tough day at the office, but sometimes the cause of the pain isn't so obvious. Below you'll find some of the most common sitting-related ailments and Conway's tips on how to protect yourself, stat. If your low back or hips hurt... The problem: You're probably slouching -- and your chair might not be at the right height, either. The fix: Adjust your seat to maintain the normal curve in the lower spine. Tilt the seat of the chair to angle slightly down. You should be able to fit one or two fingers between your knees and the edge of the seat to alleviate pressure on the legs. Also consider using an alternative desk chair that incorporates movement or supportive cushions behind the lower back. If your mid back hurts... The problem: You're probably slouching, and you're definitely not moving enough. The fix: Move more. A lot more. If you can, once every 20 minutes. Because your head, neck and shoulders are typically forward as you sit in your chair, focus on stretching the opposite way. Look up at the ceiling, stick the chest out and roll the shoulders back. Sitting up straight will keep your shoulders and mid-back in this neutral position naturally. If your hands or wrists hurt... The problem: Stretching and twisting your hands and fingers to type, and typing with furious speed and force. The pain and fatigue here may also be due to carpal tunnel syndrome, which can include tingling, numbness and shooting pains through the hands and wrist. The fix: If your keyboard is angled up, switch the stand on the back of it to keep it laying flat. Adjust the height of your chair to keep your elbows as close as possible to a 90-degree angle and keep your arms close to your sides. If your neck hurts... The problem: You're cradling the phone between your shoulder and your ear, you're slouching and you're probably looking downward at a computer screen. (You might also feel pain in your jaw or get frequent headaches.) The fix: Use a speakerphone, headphones or a headset if you're going to be talking and typing at the same time. Adjust the height of your computer screen -- even if that just means stacking it on top of some books -- so that your chin is even with the center of the screen. Position the screen straight in front of you so you're not constantly turning to the side.", "Jed Udall, the son of Sen.

However, as they were celebrating the wonderful news, the doctor came to them with information that would break their hearts.

However, West, the self-proclaimed \"greatest artist of all time\" pulled major visual inspiration from another artist \u2014 realist painter Vincent Desiderio, whose 2004 piece, \"Sleep\" debuted at New York's Marlborough Gallery and was later completed in 2008.

The data, compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), also indicate that approximately 9.3 million adults, or about 4 percent of those Americans ages 18 and up, experience \"serious mental illness\" \u2013 that is, their condition impedes day-to-day activities, such as going to work. This data does not diverge greatly from the last SAMHSA report, released in 2012, which found that 45.9 million American adults, 20 percent of this demographic, experienced mental illness at least once annually. (Though there is a 1.8 percent difference, the statistics do have margins of error, and methods of compiling them are often revised, so this dip does not necessarily mean there has been a long-term decline in mental illness.) The SAMHSA paper comes amid increasing scrutiny of the ability of America\u2019s health care system to handle issues of mental illness. For example, the American Mental Health Counselors Association released a study earlier this week claiming that adults with mental illness who live in those states electing against expanding Medicaid under Obamacare will be denied insurance. According to the study, care could be denied to up to 4 million patients. The SAMHSA study breaks down mental illness rates by state. Perhaps surprisingly, New Jersey had the lowest national rates of overall and severe mental illness \u2013 14.7 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively. The states with the most mental illness? In Utah, 22.3 percent of the adult population experienced mental illness, and in West Virginia had the most cases of severe mental illness among adults, at 5.5 percent. It may be tempting to look at the map that accompanies the study and try to make guesses at why, say, the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest seem to suffer more from mental illness than other regions. However, because there is so much mental health illness in all the states \u2013 and lots of uncontrolled variables \u2013 it would be hard to draw any real conclusions. According to the study, \"factors that potentially contribute to the variation are not well understood and need further study.\" Not all psychiatric statisticians are satisfied with SAMHSA\u2019s findings, with some alleging that the agency grossly understates the prevalence of mental illness. Ronald Kessler, McNeil Family Professor of Health Care at Harvard and expert in large scale mental illness surveys, tells Newsweek that SAMHSA\u2019s assessment of serious mental illness is \"pretty good\" but that he believes that the \"prevalence for any mental illness is too low.\" Kessler, who is familiar with SAMHSA\u2019s computational methods, said that the agency did not measure all of the ailments in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -- including some major ones like attention deficit disorder. \"I find it objectionable that they use this term \u2018any mental illness,\u2019\" he says. \"What they really mean is any mental illness that they decided to measure. What they ask about is anxiety and depression and drinking and drugs, but there are many things beside that they totally ignored.\"\u2019 Kessler estimates that the prevalence of mental illness might range from 25 to 30 percent of American adults. A 2011 report published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pegs the number at 25 percent. SAMHSA\u2019s statistics division disagrees with Kessler\u2019s assessment. \"This captures the majority of people suffering from mental illness in the country,\" Dr. Kevin Hennessy, deputy director of the Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, tells Newsweek. According to the report, the state-level estimates are based on data collected from 92,400 adults 18 and over from the 2011 and 2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. The survey itself was built around the DSM, but also includes an \"improved prediction model\" developed based on previous survey attempts. Ultimately, the experts might be splitting hairs; even the state with the lowest rate of mental illness still nears 15 percent. Perhaps more importantly, only 62.9 percent of adults nationwide with serious mental illness received mental health treatment in the year they reported this illness. Dr. Peter Delany \u2013 director of the \"the government\u2019s lead agency for behavioral health statistics,\" the Center for Behavioral Health and Statistics and Quality, according to SAMHSA\u2019s website \u2013 tells Newsweek that the information shows policymakers, in black and white terms, that mental illness impacts a large portion of the population, regardless of statistical caveats. \"These are real people that have very serious problems,\" he says. \"The data should be helping us think through how we want to approach helping them get services that they need.\"", "It's something that most people do at least twice a day but for anyone whose ever skipped cleaning their teeth, you may want to read on. According to dentists, skipping the twice daily cleanse can lead to all sorts of health issues such as loose teeth, bleeding gums and even coronary heart disease.  Here, Dr Ken Harris of Riveredge Cosmetic Dentistry in the North East, Dr Sameer Patel, Clinical Director of elleven and Dr Adam Thorne of Harley Street Dental Studio, reveal what really happens when you skip brushing your teeth.  Bad breath: If you fall into the habit of not brushing your teeth and your tongue regularly, this can cause a build-up of plaque, a clear sticky film on your teeth, and bacteria. Aside from bad breath, not removing plaque can lead to decay, cavities in your teeth and irreparable damage to the tooth structure. If you don\u2019t brush your teeth then the bugs that live in your mouth will literally take over. It also means that food particles will remain in your mouth which can cause bacteria to grow and cause bad breath. Coronary heart disease: The toxins and bacteria in your mouth can get into your blood stream and connect themselves to the coronary arteries, causing a potential blockage, which could lead to a heart attack. Brush teeth twice a day for at least two minutes, in the morning before breakfast and in the evening before you go to sleep Use fluoride toothpaste and a softly bristled brush The bristles should come into contact with both the gumline and surface of your teeth, the brush should be held at a 45-degree angle against your gums and rather than scrubbing teeth back-and-forth, gently move your brush in circular motions Replace your toothbrush every three months  Bleeding gums: Brushing your teeth stimulates blood flow to the gums, which is an important part of oral health. If the teeth aren\u2019t brushed, then you\u2019re setting yourself up for inflamed, bleeding gums. Loose teeth: Failing to clean your teeth can eventually lead to periodontitis, which, if not treated, can damage the bone in your jaw and open up spaces between the gums and your teeth, which can lead to teeth becoming loose. No kissing! The chances of anyone wanting to get up close and personal when you\u2019ve got teeth that are decaying through lack of care and bits of food which are stuck between your teeth are going to be minimal.  Teeth staining: This is also inevitable, as the colour from food and drink with staining properties such as red wine, curry and coffee stick to the plaque, which has formed and causes discolouration if not brushed away. ", "Many people are afraid of bugs, even if they\u2019re completely harmless. Something about all of those wiggling legs and fluttering wings can be too much for certain folks to handle. While a fear of insects is totally understandable, it\u2019s rarely justified. The vast majority of insects are pretty much harmless. But what one man in the southern United States found skittering around in his house is actually worthy of your nightmares, and it\u2019s got a creepy habit so bizarre that you won\u2019t sleep for a week. This freaky scorpion/wasp hybrid recently appeared in the home of  Reddit user Synnyr. After posting the photos, he found out that it was actually a scorpionfly. Even though they look terrifying, these insects are largely harmless and pose no danger to humans. However, they do have one rather unsettling habit. They have a real affinity for human flesh, but not in the way you might think. Turns out, scorpionflies actually feed on human corpses and even use them to lay their eggs inside. In fact, the practice is so common that forensic investigators in Texas look for scorpionflies to determine a person\u2019s time of death.

It doesn\u2019t matter if you happened to wear your best fedora. It doesn\u2019t even matter if you could be a voice double for Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes himself. If you value your life, do not allow yourself to be seduced by \"My Way\" when you see it in the selection book\u2014it\u2019s literally a killer. In 2007, a man was performing the song in San Mateo in the Philippines when a security guard loudly informed the singer that he was off-key. When man continued to croon, the guard pulled out a .38 caliber pistol and shot the performer in the chest, killing him. Freak occurrence? Nope. Since 2000, at least half a dozen people have been murdered after (or while) performing the Sinatra classic. Dubbed the \"\u2018My Way\u2019 Killings,\" the strange phenomenon has gotten so bad that some bar owners have removed it from the selection list entirely. Theories abound as to why this particular song seems to evoke such violence. It could be that the song is just so Sinatra that anyone else who sings it is bound to pale in comparison. It could be, according to singing school owner Butch Albarracin, that the lyrics inspire \"pride and arrogance in the singer, as if you\u2019re somebody when you\u2019re really nobody.\" Pop culture expert Roland Tolentino believes it\u2019s all about location\u2014these killings have all occurred in the Philippines. \"The Philippines is a very violent society, so karaoke only triggers what already exists here when certain social rules are broken,\" he said. While the \"My Way\" Killings do seem to be limited to a certain locale, karaoke rage seems to happen all over the world.

And Huang announced last year that the company will pay college tuition for employees' kids out of his own pocket. Weddings will be paid for with company money, though.

For example, the outlet reports that the company's warehouse employees are paid $14 an hour. \"Building culture is a money-saver over time,\" Huang told Quartz. He estimates about 10 percent of employees will take advantage of the wedding offer. So what if you don't want to get married or just aren't into the idea of a wedding?

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) President Obama President Obama commuted the sentences of 214 federal prisoners on Wednesday. At least 67 of them were serving life sentences, many of those for nonviolent drug crimes. The White House The White House points out that Obama has granted \"more commutations than the previous nine presidents combined and more commutations than any individual president in nearly a century.\" This is true, but it's also a slightly misleading statistic. When it comes to granting relief to people convicted of crimes, presidents typically have two options: They can commute a prisoner's sentence or they can pardon the prisoner completely. A commutation \"reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, that is then being served, but it does not change the fact of conviction, imply innocence, or remove civil disabilities that apply to the convicted person as a result of the criminal conviction,\" When it comes to granting relief to people convicted of crimes, presidents typically have two options: They can commute a prisoner's sentence or they can pardon the prisoner completely. A commutation \"reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, that is then being served, but it does not change the fact of conviction, imply innocence, or remove civil disabilities that apply to the convicted person as a result of the criminal conviction,\" according to the Justice Department A pardon, on the other hand, \"is an expression of the president\u2019s forgiveness and ordinarily is granted in recognition of the applicant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for the crime and established good conduct for a significant period of time after conviction or completion of sentence.\" In other words, as legal scholar Michael Walden of New York University In other words, as legal scholar Michael Walden of New York University once explained , a \"pardon wipes out the conviction while a commutation leaves the conviction intact but wipes out the punishment.\" Obama has been issuing commutations at a rapid pace in his last few years in office. But he's only issued 70 pardons so far, Obama has been issuing commutations at a rapid pace in his last few years in office. But he's only issued 70 pardons so far, according to the Justice Department . That's fewer pardons than any president going all the way back to William McKinley, the earliest president for which the Justice Department tracks clemency statistics. For a fuller picture of presidential clemency actions, it's best to compare the average number of pardons and commutations issued by each president per month of their presidencies. That way, you don't have to worry about different amounts of time in office skewing those numbers. Here's what that chart looks like for all pardons and commutations, including the latest batch announced by the Obama administration. At an average of seven pardons or commutations per month, Obama is now issuing clemency actions at a faster pace than any president since Jimmy Carter. But those numbers are still well under historic norms for most of the 20th century. Woodrow Wilson granted pardons and commutations at a rate of nearly 30 per month. Herbert Hoover issued an average of 25 per month. But the clemency picture under Obama is now very different than it was just two years ago, before Obama's clemency work started in earnest. Back then, he was issuing pardons and commutations at a slower rate than any president of the past century. The latest commutations are welcome news for criminal justice reform groups, such as The latest commutations are welcome news for criminal justice reform groups, such as Families Against Mandatory Minimums , which are working to reduce overall prison populations. But absent much larger commutation efforts on a massive scale, a single president's efforts aren't likely to make a huge dent in the federal prison population. Obama's 562 commutations and 70 pardons represent approximately one-third of 1 percent of the total federal prison population of 205,000 inmates \u2014 to say nothing of the more than 1.3 million people currently held in state prisons.

Currently, there are nine states with no state income tax: Alaska Florida New Hampshire Nevada South Dakota Tennessee Texas Washington Wyoming New Hampshire and Tennessee, however, tax dividends and income from investments. Be sure to check for other taxes such as property taxes and sales tax, for example, that might be levied in lieu of state income taxes. 2. Move to a state with no tax on Social Security or pension income According to CCH, the Tax Foundation and Vertex Research, there are 12 states that do not tax Social Security or pension income: Alabama Alaska Florida Mississippi Nevada New Hampshire Pennsylvania South Dakota Tennessee Texas Washington Wyoming 3.

Refinance Parent PLUS Loans If you borrowed a Parent PLUS loan for your child to attend college, and your child has now graduated, your retirement is an optimal time to refinance your Parent PLUS loan. A direct Parent Loan from the federal government for undergraduate students, also known as a Parent PLUS loan, has higher interest rates than student loans as well as fees. There are two ways to refinance a Parent PLUS loan: As the parent borrower, you can refinance the Parent PLUS loan in your name; or Your child can refinance the Parent PLUS loan in his or her name If your child refinances the Parent PLUS loan into a student loan, he or she will need to have sufficient income and credit history to be approved for the student loan refinancing and also will be financially responsible for the student loan. Since the federal government does not refinance Parent Loans or student loans, you or your child would refinance with a private lender. If your child refinances the Parent PLUS loan into his or her name, the parent borrower could act as a co-signer to help him or her receive a lower interest rate. A co-signer, however, would be financially responsible for the refinanced student loan. 6. Remove yourself as a co-signer of a student loan If you are a co-signer of your child's student loan and no longer want to be financially responsible for your child's student loan, your child can refinance their student loan with a private lender. In this case, you as the parent co-signer would no longer be financially responsible for your child's student loan (and your child would have full responsibility). If your child already refinanced his or her student loan with a private lender, and you are a co-signer to your child's student loan, you should check with the lender regarding a co-signer release option (which would absolve you the parent borrower of financial responsibility).

In a roundtable with the Hollywood Reporter, Broad City's Ilana Glazer dished on some of the subtle sexism she and co-star Abbi Jacobson face even on the set of their own show. \"Recently, this guy was calling us 'ladybugs\" and 'love bugs,'\" Glazer told the Reporter. \"We're like, 'We have a show \u2014 you are helping run the promo for the show that we created!'\" Glazer said people also tend to blur the lines between her and her character and believe they are entitled to her body. \"People go to touch me a lot,\" Glazer said to the other actresses at the round table, which included Rachel Bloom, Allison Janney, Niecy Nash, Gina Rodriguez and Lily Tomlin. \"They think I want to have sex with them, I guess, because my character's horny.\" Bloom, who lived with Glazer in Brooklyn after college, said she learned tactics for dealing with street harassment from Glazer. \"Her advice for it was to go, 'Suck my dick!'\" said Bloom, who stars in My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. \"Because here's what it does: The guy is having a mental image of you, like, naked, and then when you go, 'Suck my dick' or 'Lick my balls,' it throws them for a loop. They're like, 'Wait, she has balls? What am I picturing now?'\" While it's perhaps not the most sensitive way to go about taking down one's harassers, it's sure to get a woman at least a moment's peace and quiet.", "Recently, he decided to do something with that data trove that was long considered unthinkable: He is getting rid of it. The reason? Gadea fears that one day, the FBI might do to him what it did to Apple in their recent legal battle: Demand that he give the agency access to his encrypted data. Rather than make what he considers a Faustian bargain, he\u2019s building a system that he hopes will avoid the situation entirely. \"We have to keep as little [information] as possible so that even if the government or some other entity wanted access to it, we\u2019d be able to say that we don\u2019t have it,\" said Gadea, founder and chief executive of Envoy. The 30-person company enables businesses to register visitors using iPads instead of handwritten visitor logs. The technology tracks who works at a firm, who visits the firm, and their contact information. In Silicon Valley, there\u2019s a new emphasis on putting up barriers to government requests for data. The Apple-FBI case and its aftermath have tech firms racing to employ a variety of tools that would place customer information beyond the reach of a government-ordered search. The trend is a striking reversal of a long-standing article of faith in the data-hungry tech industry, where everyone from Google to the latest start-up has predicated success on the ability to hoover up as much information as possible about consumers. Now, some large tech firms are increasingly offering services to consumers that rely far less on collecting data. The sea change is even becoming evident among early-stage companies that see holding so much data as more of a liability than an asset, given the risk that cybercriminals or government investigators might come knocking.

Andreessen\u2019s firm, Andreessen Horowitz, is an investor in Envoy. The government abandoned its effort to force Apple to help unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino terrorists and paid professional hackers to crack the phone instead. But experts say the issue is far from settled, and will probably be the subject of court and legislative battles. Start-ups are particularly wary, Andreessen said, of legislation proposed recently by Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would compel tech companies to build technical methods to share customers\u2019 encrypted data, at a court\u2019s request. \"They believe there\u2019s this window of opportunity that if we build strong encryption now, we can make it a fait accompli. But if we let five years pass, it may never happen,\" Andreessen said. In the past two years, more companies have embraced encryption, which scrambles information so that it looks like a stream of unintelligible characters to an outsider who accessed it without permission. What\u2019s changed more recently, industry officials say, is that companies are encrypting data and throwing away the key to prevent their gaining access, a move which started with Apple but is spreading across the Valley. This latter tactic is the most worrisome to law enforcement. Government officials have said repeatedly they do not want to outlaw encryption; FBI Director James B. Comey has called strong encryption a vital means of protecting the public\u2019s personal information from hackers. But officials insist that there must be a technical means to access that information when companies are served with warrants. Otherwise, there will be \"profound consequences for public safety,\" Comey told Congress in March. Terrorists and criminals are already using messaging services to which tech companies have thrown away the key, he said. Investigators say two such services, WhatsApp and Telegram, were used by terrorists in the Brussels bombings that killed more than 30 people and wounded hundreds. \"This is a Silicon Valley delusion that the government wants to outlaw encryption,\" Stewart A. Baker, a former National Security Agency general counsel, said in an interview. \"I grant that there is a radicalized subculture of engineers that is very prone to that delusion, but it is a delusion.\" Surely not every company will resort to building such systems. Many simply can\u2019t. Their business relies on targeted advertising or the mining of customer data, and cutting off access would be a recipe for failure. But many start-ups that wouldn't have considered it before the Apple FBI fight are now doing so and discussing the accompanying trade-offs, said Bret Taylor, formerly Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer and now chief executive of the start-up Quip. The trade-offs can be significant: Heavy encryption risks slowing down your service. It limits the ability to analyze customer behavior or introduce new features. (Encrypting email, for example, would make it harder to search through email.) Once you give customers the only key to their data, you can\u2019t give them a backup if they lose it. Such efforts among over the last few years have been described as part of an arms race between large tech companies and potential invaders, spurred largely by the growing threat of cyberattacks. To some extent, they\u2019ve also been prompted by a newfound wariness of government after Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about government surveillance, as well as a growing awareness among entrepreneurs of the sheer sensitivity of the data on their services. Apple led the pack, launching end-to-end encryption with its popular messaging app, iMessage, in 2011. In 2014, the company blocked its own access to information stored on iPhones -- data that disappears permanently after ten failed passcode attempts. (End-to-end encryption enables only the partners trading messages to decode them. The companies providing the means to transmit them cannot.) WhatsApp, the global messaging service owned by Facebook, announced end-to-end encryption this year, as did Viber, a messaging app that is popular in Europe. These years-long technical efforts predated the FBI case. Cloudera and Box, two larger tech start-ups selling data storage and processing systems to large corporations, have built encrypted systems over the past year in which only the customer has the keys needed to unscramble data. The case between Apple and FBI and the possibility of so-called \"backdoor\" legislation \u2014 mandating encryption bypasses for law enforcement \u2014 is a new inflection point. Earlier this month, Google launched Allo, a chat app which allows users to switch on end-to-end encryption, and Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos said he was exploring measures to encrypt data and throw away the keys on devices owned by the Seattle, Wash.-based company. Stealth Worker \u2014 a start-up funded six months ago by the prominent incubator Y-Combinator \u2014 provides contract cybersecurity experts to early-stage start-ups which often operate on a shoestring budget. Stealth Worker\u2019s chief executive Ken Baylor, said that in the past month, he had been approached by a half-dozen companies looking for ways to build tougher encryption and other secure technical architectures. But many don\u2019t want to talk about it, he said. \"They are afraid of a phone-call from someone high up saying that they are unpatriotic,\" Baylor said. Bracket Computing, a 70-person Silicon Valley start-up, embarked on an encryption project about a month ago intended to make it easier for customers to hold the keys to their own data. That way, \"I can\u2019t get subpoenaed the way Apple did,\" Bracket chief executive Tom Gillis said. \"This clears up the whole issue: If you have an issue with my customer, go talk to my customer, don\u2019t talk to me. I\u2019m just a tech guy, and I don\u2019t want to be in the middle of these things.\" Gillis said that initially, customers seeking the ability to hold the keys to their data were large, sophisticated financial services companies, such as Goldman Sachs and Blackstone. Today, a broader array of companies, including media and automotive firms and small banks, are making these requests. Advances in Intel\u2019s chips, he said, have made it possible to build these complex systems 13 times as fast as in 2010. Building systems that cut off a company\u2019s access to customer data is time- and resource-intensive, and these systems don\u2019t come without risks. Envoy CEO Gadea, an engineering prodigy who was hired by Google when he was just 18, estimates that his company\u2019s data-wiping project will take a few months and about three engineers working full time. Currently, when a visitor enters a building with an Envoy registration system, a message is sent alerting the appropriate employee that they have a guest. Envoy can send such messages \u2014 by text, email or other messaging services \u2014 because the customer data is stored on its servers, which are hosted remotely by Amazon Web Services, the cloud division of Amazon. The information is encrypted, but Envoy holds the keys to unscramble it. (Amazon CEO Bezos owns The Washington Post). Under the new protocol, the engineering team will have to reconfigure the system so that the keys to unscramble the data are kept by the customers on the iPads used to sign people in. Envoy will no longer have the ability to access the keys. The technical challenge will be making it possible for the iPads to alert people when they have visitors, instead of having the alerts come from Envoy\u2019s servers. The goal is to make the change unnoticeable to users, Gadea says, but it could take months to get there. There will undoubtedly be many trade-offs, Gadea said. Not only will Envoy sacrifice the ability to send visitor notifications directly, but customer service also could be become more challenging. Today, if one of Envoy\u2019s 2,000 customers asks for help correcting a mistake in a visitor name or resetting a password, an Envoy customer service rep can lend a hand. Under the new system Envoy\u2019s reps could have their hands tied. The new system could also make it harder to fix software errors because Envoy will no longer be able to push out automatic updates from its servers. And if a customer loses its passwords or keys, Envoy won\u2019t have the ability to restore the lost data. It will be inaccessible forever. Gadea said he is not anti-government and would sell Envoy\u2019s services to the FBI if the agency wished to become a customer. \"It\u2019s like with your friends,\" he said, \"you\u2019re always going to find one thing you don\u2019t like about them. But you\u2019re not going to hate a person because of one disagreement.\" And he said he understands the trade-offs. \"\"For a small startup trying to iterate quickly, it definitely slows things down,\" Gadea said. \"But in the long run, it\u2019s a competitive advantage and it reduces risk on our company. I can sleep better at night.\" Staff writer Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report", "Let's be honest: 2016 was rough.

As legend has it, the team was cursed in 1945 when tavern-owner William \"Billy Goat\" Sianis was kicked out of Game 4 of the Cubs' World Series game against the Detroit Tigers for bringing his smelly billy goat, Murphy. On his way out, Sianis is reputed to have declared, \"Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more,\" thus spawning the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat that lasted seven decades. Several women of color made political history last month when they were elected to prominent leadership positions within their respective states. California Attorney General Kamala Harris became the first black woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the Golden State; Ilhan Omar became the first Somali-American lawmaker in the U.S. with her election to the Minnesota legislature; Catherine Cortez Masto became the first Latina senator in history when she won her U.S. Senate bid in Nevada; and Pramila Jayapal became the first Indian-American congresswoman with her victory in Washington state. Few albums in history have managed to be as simultaneously vulnerable and powerful as \"Lemonade\" \u2014 Beyonce's sixth solo record that laid bare an important slice of black womanhood.

But it wasn't the only great album of 2016: Frank Ocean, A Tribe Called Quest and Beyonce's own sister, Solange, also created stunning music this year. For most people, any bad day can be made slightly brighter by the mere thought that \"Hamilton: An American Musical\" is out there and might, one day, be enjoyed by you again or for the very first time. In June, the hip-hip Broadway sensation took home 11 Tony Awards \u2014 including Best Musical, the biggest prize of all. But the most moving moment of the ceremony came when show creator Lin-Manuel Miranda delivered his emotional \"Love is love is love\" speech while accepting the award for Best Score. Hours earlier, a lone gunman had killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando. President Obama made history in March when he became the first U.S. leader to visit Cuba in 88 years, culminating 15 months' worth of effort to reestablish diplomatic relations between the two countries.

They just let the music flow, riffing off something that exists and creating something new. That's what we call creative genius. But where does this improvisational ability come from? Charles Limb, a music-obsessed otolaryngologist and surgeon, wanted to know exactly that. Over the past few years, he's put jazz musicans and rappers into MRI machines to see what's happening in their brain as they freestyle and improvise. Results showed that when someone is creating something new, parts of the brain associated with self-expression (language and at times, especially while freestyle rapping, parts associated with visual imagery) are highly active. At the same time, and perhaps more interestingly, another part of the brain associated with inhibition quiets down. At a TEDx talk in 2010, he said it looks like it does this \"so that you're not inhibited, so that you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses\". Below is a graphic from Limb's studies that shows that while improvising, areas of the brain involved in self-monitoring \u2013 the sort of thing that might stop creativity \u2013 quiet down (those are blue); while areas of the brain connected to expression and language become very active (in red). TED It's important to be cautious about research like this, as Limb notes, because we're just scratching the surface here. We know very little about how the brain works. Plus, images of what's happening in the brain \u2013 as fascinating as they are \u2013 are still a sort of observational science. We see something that's happening but don't know what's driving it and certainly can't manipulate it yet, flipping a creative switch. But this is a start to understanding what creativity looks like. To first look at what was happening as a jazz musician came up with something new, Limb had six musicians go through a set of steps. First he had them play scales, then improvise on them. Then they played a memoriSed piece of music, and finally an improvised version of that \u2013 all while inside an MRI scanner. But they were up to the challenge. And all showed similar results while improvising \u2013 a dampening of parts of the brain associated with inhibition and an increase in activity associated with self expression. Here's another graphic showing the way that brain activity changed. Blue is a decrease in activity, red is an increase: TED When Limb first published his research on the topic, co-author Allen Braun noted the similarities between the brains of improvisers and the brains of people in REM sleep \u2013 while they were dreaming. \"It's tantalising to think some connection exists between improvisation and dreaming, which are both spontaneous events. These musicians may in fact be in a waking dream,\" Braun told Hopkins Medicine. Limb has followed this up with other research since then. He's shown that while improvising with partners, musicians' language centres in the brain are highly active, lending support to the idea that their music may actually be understood by the brain as a 'language' on its own. More than anything else, it's fascinating to start to look at what creativity is on a neurological level. After all, the brain is perhaps the greatest unexplored frontier in understanding how people work. We've mapped the human genome but are still trying to understand the massive network of neurons and glial cells beneath our skull. Concepts like creativity \u2013 the ability to make a mental leap and come up with something new \u2013 are even more mysterious. \"We know very little about how we are able to be creative,\" Limb says in the TED talk. But as he told Hopkins Medicine before, creativity is a fundamental part of humanity. \"Without this type of creativity, humans wouldn't have advanced as a species,\" says Limb. \"It's an integral part of who we are.\"", "If you've ever traveled far and long to see a famous monument, you know it's an exciting experience.

Heigl's behavior has sparked some sour reactions in the past. Most notably, the actress publicly knocked her two biggest successes, calling \"Knocked Up\" sexist and announcing she would not seek an Emmy for her role in \"Grey's Anatomy,\" because the writing wasn't up to her standards. According to Hollywood insiders, the issue extends to her conduct on set. One source from the 2010 film \"Life As We Know It\" recalled \"desperately difficult situations\" with the actress, saying, \"she can cost you time every single day of shooting ... wardrobe issues, not getting out of the trailer, questioning the script every single day.\" Except it wasn't just Heigl causing problems on set ... her mother was often part of the problem. The \"Life As We Know It\" source added: \"I have never experienced anything like Nancy Heigl. It's about the mouth. 'F--- you. You are a f---ing liar.' ... Whatever you'd say, you were an idiot. The call would be, 'This is the worst craft service we've ever had! There's nothing to eat! This is the worst wardrobe!' You knew that every day, you were going to get slammed.\" A producer at a major network, who reportedly turned down Heigl for a project, explained Heigl's difficult behavior, simply saying, \"She's not worth it.\" Heigl's latest films, \"The Big Wedding\" and \"One For The Money,\" have collectively pulled less than 10 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, and returning to the small screen after her big screen failures is certainly a questionable move.

Her fear made filming some scenes in the movie quite scary because her character's treatment includes water therapy. \"I was a kid and I was riding this tricycle around a swimming pool and I drove my tricycle into the swimming pool and I didn't let go and my brother tried to [help me],\" Aniston explained. \"So, I can't go underwater and no one will believe me.

This is mint. It is an invaluable ally in the fight", "It\u2019s been a strange year in politics\u2014have you noticed? Republican voters turned up their noses at what might have been the most diverse group of presidential hopefuls the Party has put on offer, settling on (way) outsider Donald Trump, who's headlining a riotous convention in Cleveland this week. Democrats will officially nominate Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia next week, concluding a fierce challenge from self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders that she and most observers hadn't anticipated gaining nearly as much support. And if the drama on this side of the Atlantic weren't enough, Brits narrowly voted to part ways with the European Union. There\u2019s a single, powerful psychological force that makes all three of these political surprises a lot easier to understand: loss aversion. In general, we work much harder to avoid losses than we do to pursue gains. Here's how it seems to be working lately in U.S. and U.K. politics. Over the past few months, Trump, Sanders, and Brexit campaigners have all met success by reiterating the message that things are headed in the wrong direction\u2014that sticking with the status quo is equivalent to a sure loss. Here\u2019s a sampling: We tried it President Obama\u2019s way\u2014doesn\u2019t work. He gave the world his apology tour. We got ISIS and many other problems in return. \u2014 Donald Trump The global economy is not working for the majority of people in our country and the world. This is an economic model developed by the economic elite to benefit the economic elite. We need real change. \u2014 Bernie Sanders If people feel they have lost control completely, and we have lost control of our borders completely as members of the EU, and if people feel that voting doesn\u2019t change anything, then violence is the next step. I find it difficult to contemplate it happening here, but nothing\u2019s impossible. \u2014 Nigel Farage Disavowing business as usual and calling for a clean slate is nothing new. To a certain extent, it's just how most politicians speak. But the the fact that these politicians in particular have each been this successful campaigning almost exclusively on such a message is remarkable. And it highlights a pattern in human behavior that's well-known to psychologists: Our aversion to losses is often powerful enough to cause us to take risks that don\u2019t always make much sense (at least not in the modern world). There are lots of voters who aren\u2019t just clambering for change; they\u2019re willing to take a chance of making things worse in exchange for a chance at making things better. This isn't a political question, it's a probabilistic one. Suppose, for example, that you're facing a certain loss of $3,000. The person to whom you owe that large sum, however, is willing to offer you a type of lottery: You can spin a wheel (one that's been verified as legitimate and will lead to a fair outcome) that will come up red 80% of the time and green 20% of the time. If you spin green, you will owe nothing; if your spin lands on red, however, you'll owe him $4,000. What do you do? On average, the lottery is less attractive than just paying the $3,000 outright. That is, if you spun the wheel over and over you could expect to lose $3,200 per spin. But when faced with this decision in rose . On average, the lottery is less attractive than just paying the $3,000 outright. That is, if you spun the wheel over and over you could expect to lose $3,200 per spin. But when faced with this decision in a study , the overwhelming majority of subjects chose the lottery over the sure loss; their appetite for riskrose Our aversion to losses and our willingness to accept risk are closely intertwined. As of this week, Our aversion to losses and our willingness to accept risk are closely intertwined. As of this week, more than two-thirds of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and the sentiment in the U.K. on the eve of the Brexit vote wasn\u2019t much better . In other words, there are lots of voters who aren\u2019t just clambering for change; they\u2019re willing to take a chance of making things worse in exchange for a chance at making things better. If most voters see the status quo as a loss, the Clinton camp may be making things harder for its candidate than necessary. Without question, there are additional psychological forces that have contributed to the Brexit, Sanders, and Trump surprises (not to mention the political ones). Our tendency to focus on the present and our commitment to upholding the group, for example, Without question, there are additional psychological forces that have contributed to the Brexit, Sanders, and Trump surprises (not to mention the political ones). Our tendency to focus on the present and our commitment to upholding the group, for example, are two other tendencies that are both clearly at work . It would be wrong, too, to paint the policies of a candidate like Sanders and those of somebody like Trump with the same brush. But it's nonetheless true that loss-aversion is the obvious common thread tying these calls for radical change together. Brexit has come and gone, and Sanders has bowed out to endorse Clinton. Much of the rest of the U.S. presidential campaign will revolve around how the candidates frame themselves and their opponents. But the past year in politics has made one thing abundantly clear: If most voters see the status quo as a loss, the Clinton camp may be making things harder for its candidate than necessary. As recently as last month, As recently as last month, Clinton framed Trump as too risky and too negative, saying: We cannot put the safety of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America. This approach may fall on deaf ears among undecided voters who believe things are headed the wrong direction already. To them, such a risk isn\u2019t as off-putting as Clinton might think. There\u2019s a lot that can and will unfold before the election comes to a close in November. By my reckoning, much of what happens will depend on how undecided voters see the status quo\u2014and how the candidates choose to tap into our natural aversion to losses.

You can order it in multiple editions (including an audiobook recorded by Matt and me) at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, iBooks, Google Play, Kobo, or your favorite indie bookseller. We're very proud of the book, and can't wait for people to start reading, but if you still need a taste or two to push you over the buying edge, The Ringer ran an excerpt last week featuring part of our explanation for how the top 100 was chosen, along with our joint essay on Deadwood, while Matt's home base at Vulture this morning has the essay on our top-ranked show, The Simpsons(*). (*) Maybe my favorite section of the book \u2013 and the favorite of many of the early reviewers \u2013 is called The Great Debate, where Matt and I argue out what should get the top pick after we initially wound up with a five-way tie for first place. Included below is the essay I wrote about a little show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which finished in a tie for 25th place \u2013 alongside, appropriately enough, fellow classic high school dramas Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life \u2013 among our Pantheon of series, coming up just as soon as I get the mustard out... Buffy the Vampire Slayer (WB, 1997\u20132001; UPN, 2001\u20132003) Total score: 94 TV show titles rarely bring viewers into the tent, but they can keep them out. If you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like Trophy Wife, don\"t be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away. (See also Terriers, Selfie, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...) Now, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because UPN was looking to steal a hit from its rival the WB), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in Angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire TV network for the short but memorable existence of the WB. By any standard you want to measure, Buffy was a success. Except maybe this one: If you tell someone who\"s never watched it that a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer is among the best TV dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy. Would a Buffy the Vampire Slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? Certainly, you can imagine WB executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get Joss Whedon to shorten the title to just Slayer. Whedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like \"Reign in Blood\" and \"Mandatory Suicide.\" He knew that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make. You could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy. The name tells you all of that, and suggests that if you\"re turned off by it, you\"re probably not going to like the series to which it\"s applied. It was a tonal balance that director Fran Rubel Kuzui didn\"t even bother attempting with the campy Buffy movie adapted from Whedon\"s first script. The show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by Gellar, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, and the rest of the cast. It was a series made cheaply even by the standards of TV\"s fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for Gellar. If it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter (\"I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.\"), it could. If it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible. And if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it. If anything, the exaggerated nature of the various undead villains only made the high school setting more effective, because what is adolescence if not a time when every problem gets blown wildly out of proportion? In the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldn\"t need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with Buffy and her vampire love interest Angel (David Boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while. And a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player Oz (Seth Green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full. Turning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the show\"s three seasons set in high school. Buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best TV shows ever set in high school, but it wasn\"t entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college. Even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like Buffy\"s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world). (Those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including \"Hush,\" an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; \"The Body,\" a stripped-down outing where Buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mother\"s death from natural causes; and the musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling,\" where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song.) Back to that title. Whedon once suggested to the New York Times, \"If I made Buffy the Lesbian Separatist, a series of lectures on PBS on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. The idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium.\" Whedon didn\"t invent feminism in TV storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes. (For much of its run, Buffy overlapped with Xena: Warrior Princess.) But he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them. And it was.", "NEW YORK -\u2013 The horrific deaths of James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria brought worldwide attention to the dangers journalists face in war zones. The beheadings reflected an alarming trend in 2014 in which international journalists were increasingly targeted and killed. There were at least 60 journalists killed globally in connection to their work in 2014, according to an annual report from the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization that advocates for press freedom around the world. The latest death was Afghan cameraman Zubair Hatami, who died Saturday from injuries he sustained in a Taliban attack. Committee to Protect Journalists is still investigating whether the deaths of 18 journalists were related to their work. Reporters Without Borders recently cited 66 journalist killings in its 2014 survey. The difference likely results from each organization's methodology and the ongoing investigation of some cases. Syria, mired in civil war since 2011, ranked as the most dangerous country for journalists for the third year in a row. Seventeen journalists were killed in the war-torn country this year, bringing the total to 79 in the conflict. The organization found four journalists and three media workers killed covering the war in Gaza, five journalists in Iraq, and five journalists and two media workers in Ukraine. While this year\u2019s overall toll is down from the 70 killed in 2013, the Committee to Protect Journalists found that international journalists were more frequently targeted this year than in the past. \"Reflecting in part the increasingly volatile nature of conflict zones in which Westerners are often deliberately targeted, about one quarter of the journalists killed this year were members of the international press, about double the proportion CPJ has documented in recent years,\" the report concluded. \"Over time, according to CPJ research, about nine out of every 10 journalists killed are local people covering local stories.\" As threats against international correspondents grew in 2014, the organization noted that \"the overwhelming majority of journalists under threat for their work continue to be local.\"", "Bank account a little bare? There's a better way to save: just use envelopes. Kristin Lee / Getty Images/Tetra images RF Have extra cash? Put it in an envelope. In fact, put it in several. That's how \"Broke Millennial\" author Erin Lowry saved $500 in a year on a $25,000 salary. The theater major moved to New York City in her early 20s after landing a job as a page on the David Letterman Show. The aspiring actress' job was to entertain the audience before the show started. It was fun, she said, but paid little. \"I had a vision of a starving artist and it's almost this romanticized thing that kids do in college,\" Lowry told NBC BETTER. But Lowry soon realized her paycheck wasn't nearly enough to cover the $950 a month she owed in rent. To make up the difference, she picked up extra work as a Starbucks barista and babysitter, often working all three jobs in revolving shifts in a single day. \"It was a pretty tiring time in my life,\" said Lowry. But she was determined to make it work and save money in the process. Lowry got paid in cash whenever she babysat, and got tips working at Starbucks. Instead of putting the money in a bank account, she deposited into envelopes. She split her budget into four categories and marked an envelope for each: Rent Money for Anna (Lowry's roommate, who paid the utilities) Savings Fun Fund \"Every time I came home from either of those jobs, I would usually put 50 percent into 'rent,' 25 percent into 'money for Anna,' and then 25 percent into 'savings,'\" she said. Extra cash would go into the \"fun fund\" envelope, which she joked was \"usually pretty empty.\" The 27-year-old said the envelope system is effective because you can see how much money you have in each of your budgets. \"I think it's incredibly helpful to look into your rent envelope and see, 'Hey, it's half way through the month, but I still need $300,'\" she said. \"Or to look into your savings envelope and think, 'Wow, in the last three months I've saved $200.' Especially when you're in a stage in your life where every penny counts.\" The system keeps you focused on your budgets and prevents you from overspending, according Lowry. \"If you're doing it the right way, it should be getting funded more towards the beginning of the month,\" Lowry said. \"You're saying, 'OK this is May 1 and this month I have $300 to be spending on groceries so that by the time you get to May 25, if you only have $30 left, that's all you have left to spend.\" She said it also helps prioritize your budget \"especially if you're trying to get your financial life together.\" \"I think it helps illuminate that what you thought were your priorities aren't based on how you've been spending your money and it can help you redirect and refocus,\" Lowry said. Now a full time author, blogger, and public speaker, Lowry no longer gets paid in cash. She said she still uses the same system, but with multiple checking and savings accounts in place of envelopes. \"It's the exact same system, just digital,\" she explained, noting that many banks will allow you to open multiple accounts. You can automate contributions from your paycheck to a savings account, which makes saving easy, according to the the blogger. \"When I'm logging into my checking, which I do a little more frequently than savings, I'm not seeing my savings there, so I'm not tempted to pull money out,\" Lowry said. While Lowry achieved her financial goals, there is one thing she regrets: not putting enough in her \"fun fund.\" \"I'm thankful I had that experience, but I'm also now trying to be a little bit better about finding balance in my life and saying yes sometimes and not solely always focusing on making money,\" Lowry concluded.", "Editor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the light as emanating from within a black hole, rather than beside it. Corrections have been made to reflect this small but important distinction. In the epitomizing blackness of space, few natural phenomena can compete with the darkness of black holes. After all, with their inexorable gravitational pull, nothing, not even light, can be seen ... right? Well, mostly. Last week, for the first time ever, scientists observed visible light emanating from beside a black hole with nothing more than a 20 cm. telescope. Apparently, the rather beautiful phenomena occurs when, as the Guardian explains , \"material from surrounding space falls into them and releases violent bursts of light.\" Essentially, when some matter is sucked into one of these massive pits of gravity, they emit an incredible amount of energy, which can manifest itself as light. When this happens, it looks like we\u2019re seeing light coming out of a black hole. Back in June of 2015 , a team of scientists led by Mariko Kimura of Kyoto University, became the first to ever see this sort of light through a telescope when a black hole named V404 Cygni, one of the closest to planet Earth, began showing activity after lying dormant for 26 years. Around every six and a half days, Cygni and its partner star (a celestial body a bit smaller than the sun) would circle one another, and when the black hole came to life again, it began feasting on the star. For two weeks, the astronomers were able to see flashes of light \u2014 some lasting just minutes, while others continued for several hours \u2014 as Cygni worked its magic.", "Rumors about his retirement have been swirling for months, and the time may be close at hand for Allen Iverson to officially hang up his NBA jersey.

But for many of us, cutting out carbs entirely leaves us tired, hungry, miserable and very often constipated. So what's the solution? Here, Rob Hobson, Head of Nutrition at Healthspan, busts common carb myths \u2013 and reveals the smart way to incorporate them into your diet... WHAT ACTUALLY ARE CARBOHYDRATES? Carbohydrates are the sugars, starches and fibres found in fruits, grains, vegetables and milk products \u2013 and they're our main source of energy. When it comes to sugars, there are two basic types. Intrinsic sugars are those found naturally in fruits, vegetables and milk. Extrinsic sugars are those found in table sugar, fruit juice and natural sweeteners such as honey, agave and maple syrup. These are broken down very quickly in the body, causing blood sugar spikes and troughs that can lead to energy slumps, cravings and fat storage. When you eat carbohydrate foods they increase blood sugar levels and the body releases a surge of insulin. This is a hormone that controls blood sugar by messaging muscle, liver and fat cells to take up glucose from the blood to be used for energy. When the body has enough glucose to meet its energy needs, what's left over goes to the liver and muscles to be stored as glycogen. But once the liver has stored all the glycogen it can, fat cells take up glucose and store it \u2013 hence weight gain. Excess glucose also raises levels of very low density lipoproteins \u2013 a cholesterol linked to heart disease. Starches, made up of many sugar units bonded together, are found in foods such as bread, rice, potatoes and pasta. Fibre is the name given to a range of compounds found in the cell walls of plants. It helps slow the breakdown of carbohydrate foods \u2013 preventing blood sugar fluctuations - and has been shown to help reduce the risk of many diseases. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'GOOD' AND 'BAD' CARBS The crucial thing to remember is not all carbs are the same. The key is the amount of fibre they contain. Carbs such as wholegrains (brown rice, oats), pulses (beans and lentils), quinoa, nuts and vegetables are all high in fibre. It's the carbs that have little or no fibre that are often the issue. Called refined carbs, they've been stripped of almost all fibre and a significant amount of nutrients such as vitamins and minerals during processing, A prime example of this is white flour made from refined wheat. Sugar is also classed as a refined carb and contains no nutrients, which is why it is often referred to as a source of empty calories. Sweeteners, honey, agave and maple syrup also fall into this category. Refined carbs are bad because they cause sharp spikes in blood sugar levels. This leads to large amounts of insulin being produced as the body works to lower the amount of glucose in the blood. In excess, not only can this encourage weight gain, it may also raise the risk of heart disease and insulin sensitivity, which may ultimately cause type 2 diabetes if left untreated.  WHY THE BAD RAP? Essentially, all carbs are broken down to become sugar in the end \u2013 and it's partly because of this they've become so maligned. Many of the current diet trends, such as the Dukan, Paleo and Atkins, favour a low carbohydrate approach (less than 50g per day - equivalent to two thick slices of white bread). Instead, you're advised to eat high quantities of fat and moderate amounts of protein. The rise in popularity of gluten-free eating has also led to carbs being frowned upon and even considered unhealthy by some. However, this could not be further from the truth. This is one of the most carbohydrate-rich foods and made from highly refined flour, which is lower in fibre, vitamins and minerals than wholegrains and pulses. (However it is worth noting that white flour is fortified with vitamins and minerals including thiamin and niacin, which helps to compensate for this). NUTRITION  Rich in: Nothing above the recommended amount of 30% of daily nutrients you should get from each meal.  However it is a source of the B vitamins thiamin and niacin. These help release energy from the foods we eat and keep the nervous system and skin healthy. It's only in the last few decades have we seen an explosion in obesity. Other populations around the world also have very good health with low rates of disease \u2013 yet and still eat a diet high in carbohydrates, such as Asian communities. It's highly processed foods rich in refined carbohydrates (plus factors such as excess sugar intake and a lack of activity) - not diets containing healthy portions of unprocessed carbs \u2013 that have contributed to obesity and soaring levels of disease associated with it around the world. Small servings of wholegrains and other high-fibre foods, when eaten as part of a healthy balanced diet, are fine. Research by the Mayo clinic concluded low carbohydrate diets are effective for weight loss - but should only be followed short-term, as the long-term effects of this type of diet are yet unknown. It also found when compared with a with a traditional low fat diet, the difference in weight loss was small and of questionable clinical significance in the long-term. So, eating them in moderation is still recommended. However \u2013 and crucially - when we talk about including carbs in your diet, this doesn't mean free rein to load up on large bowls of white pasta or sugar - but switch to moderate portions of high-fibre varieties as part of a balanced diet. WHY WE NEED CARBS As a nutritionist, I firmly believe there is no need to cut out carbs from your diet completely. Unprocessed foods such as brown rice, oats and wholegrain bread provide a good source of nutrients, including much needed fibre. These foods also provide a good base to making many quick and easy to prepare meals as well as being cost effective, especially when feeding families. They also keep your energy level up and combat fatigue, due to the magnesium, iron and B vitamins they contain. THE BEST GAME PLAN As with any diet, the most effective is one that you can stick to - but if you're not prepared to forgo carbohydrates then that doesn't mean you won't lose any weight. The key is to stick with whole, unprocessed foods and cut back, rather than completely cut out carbs. Below, I reveal the five of the healthiest varieties \u2013 and how to make delicious recipes with them...  TOP FIVE HEALTHIEST CARBOHYDRATE FOODS Recipes taken from The Detox Kitchen Bible, published by Bloomsbury, \u00a311.99  1. QUINOA (COOKED) NUTRITION Rich in (more than 30% of the recommended daily amount, or RDA): The energy boosting B vitamins B6, thiamin, riboflavin, folate (needed to form healthy red blood cells), iron (a lack of this can cause tiredness), magnesium (for strong bones and energy), zinc (for a strong immune system WHY EAT IT  Quinoa is a seed and has a higher protein content than many grains. It's full of essential amino acids - the building blocks of protein in the body- making it a great food for people who do not eat animal proteins. The carbohydrate content per serving is lower than many white cereal grains (found in white pasta, for example). It's also high in fibre and this, combined with the high protein content, will keep you fuller for longer \u2013 preventing hunger pangs and cravings. HOW TO EAT IT  You can easily replace rice with quinoa and it can also be thrown into salads, stir-fry's and soups rather than being served as an accompaniment if you are trying to reduce your carbohydrate intake. Serves 2, 405 calories per serving INGREDIENTS:  METHOD: 2. PEARLED SPELT (COOKED) NUTRITION Rich in (more than 30% of the RDA): niacin, thiamin, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper (helps energy production) WHY EAT IT Pearled spelt is like barley but cooks in half the time. This grain is slightly lower in carbohydrates than white refined grains but is higher in fibre, keeping your blood sugar stable. It's also rich in B vitamins and magnesium that can help to convert food into energy, warding off fatigue. HOW TO EAT IT Spelt makes a great alternative to white rice in dishes such as risotto. You can also add cooked spelt to salads, soups and stews to add a little carbohydrate to your dishes. Serves 4, 420 calories per serving INGREDIENTS: METHOD:  3. PINTO BEANS (CANNED) NUTRITION Rich in (more than 30% of the RDA): folate, iron, magnesium, zinc and calcium WHY EAT THEM  Although beans and pulses are often associated with being a vegetarian source of protein, they're also a good source of 'good' carbs. They contain about half the carb content of white refined grains but more iron, zinc and calcium - invaluable for people who don't eat meat or dairy foods. They're also an extremely rich source of fibre. HOW TO EAT THEM You can serve beans and pulses whole by adding them to salads, soups and stews, or mash them to serve as a low carbohydrate accompaniment. They also make great lower carb dips: blend them with root vegetables such as black beans and sweet potato. Serves 4, 380 calories per serving INGREDIENTS: For the chili: For the guacamole: METHOD: 4. OATS NUTRITION  This is for oats' dry weight  Rich in (more than 30% of the RDA): thiamin, iron, magnesium and zinc WHY EAT THEM This wholegrain makes for a highly nutritious breakfast and contains less carbohydrates than many other breakfast cereals that are often loaded with quickly digested sugars. Oats also contain a greater amount of protein and fibre than many other breakfast cereal options, which work together to help maintain fullness. Even better, they contain a type of soluble fibre known as beta-glucans, which help reduce bad cholesterol levels in the body. High in iron, they also help to maintain healthy red blood cell production \u2013 warding off fatigue. 5. BUTTERNUT SQUASH NUTRITION Rich in (more than 30% of the RDA): vitamins A, B6, C, thiamin, magnesium, potassium (vital to control the balance of fluids in the body). WHY EAT IT Starchy root vegetables such as butternut squash are low in carbs and have the added benefit of being higher in fibre. Brightly coloured root vegetables also count as one of your five-a-day and are rich in phytonutrients such as beta-carotene (found in orange vegetables) that acts as an disease-fighting antioxidant in the body. This group of vegetables also has a higher water content than other carbohydrate foods making it lower in calories. HOW TO EAT IT You can roast or mash most root vegetables and those such as squash and carrot can be spiralized to make nice (and far healthier) alternatives to foods such as spaghetti.

In the Middle Ages, you would be lucky to live to 40, while for many people today, 90 or even 100 isn\u2019t out of the question. But one man not only figured out the secret to a long life, he might have been the oldest person to ever live. And when you hear his story, you\u2019ll be totally captivated! This is Li Ching Yuen. According to a 1930 article from The New York Times, he reportedly lived to be 256 years old... In 1928, professor Wu-Chung Chieh of Chengdu university discovered documentation congratulating Li on his 150th birthday in 1827, and even more documents congratulating him on his 200th birthday in 1877. According to the Times article, the old men in the neighborhood claimed that Li was already a grown man when they were just children. Li began his career as an herbalist at just ten years old, and for almost forty years, had a diet of mostly herbs, goji berries, lingzi, wild ginseng, he shoo wu, gotu kola, and rice wine. He continued this for the next 100 years of his life. At the age of 71, in 1749, he joined the Chinese army as a martial arts instructor. He was a beloved member of his community, and reportedly married 23 times, fathering some 200 children in the process. But supposedly, he wasn\u2019t even the oldest man that he knew! One of his disciples claimed that Li once met a 500-year-old man that taught him Qigong exercises and a special herb-rich diet that can help people live extraordinarily long lives. When asked about the secret to his long life, Li had this to say: \"Keep a quiet heart, sit like a tortoise, walk sprightly like a pigeon, and sleep like a dog.\" Whether or not you believe the story, that certainly sounds like sage wisdom. We could all stand to take a page from this incredible man\u2019s book!", "Do Americans love their neighbors as themselves? Although \"love\" might be pushing it, most Americans are pretty happy with their neighbors. To understand how Americans feel about their neighbors, Trulia surveyed 3,014 American adults on September 25-27, 2013. Hey-Diddly-Ho, Neighborino! Let's start with the good news. Unlike Homer Simpson, who lives next door to the annoying Ned Flanders, two thirds of all Americans like their neighbors, and that number jumps to 80% among people who know their neighbors' names. But even among people who don't know their neighbors' names, 53% like their neighbors. Does renting versus owning make a difference? You bet. Homeowners are much more likely than renters are to like their neighbors (74% for owners, 58% for renters) and to know their neighbors' names (61% for owners, 39% for renters). How about geography? Looking across regions, Midwesterners are most likely to know their neighbors' names: 60% do, compared with 51% in the Northeast and the South, and 49% in the West. But perhaps Westerners are easier-going, since they're the most likely to like their neighbors (72% in the West vs. 67% nationally), despite being the least likely to know their names. More suburbanites, too, like their neighbors and know their names than people who live in more urban areas. % who generally like their neighbors % who know their neighbors' names Owners 74% 61% Renters 58% 39% Northeast 67% 51% Midwest 67% 60% South 65% 51% West 72% 49% Urban 65% 46% Suburban 68% 54% Very few people - just 5% - say they dislike their neighbors, and only 5% are thinking about moving away because of them. If a disagreement arose with a neighbor, 61% would try to fix the conflict by getting to know their neighbor better and patching up the relationship, while only 4% would get into a fight or argument. All in all, Americans should consider themselves lucky to have such good neighborly relationships. Most didn't plan it that way: in fact, few people considered their prospective neighbors as a \"very important\" factor when they chose their current home. The cost and condition of the home, as well as the location of the neighborhood, were far more important considerations. Few People Said Neighbors Were \"Very Important\" in Choosing Homes Consideration When Choosing Current Home % \"very important\" Cost of home 57% Condition of home 54% Location of neighborhood 46% Character of neighborhood 37% Size of home 30% Neighbors 16% Despite neighbors taking a back seat compared with other considerations when choosing a home, harmony reigns in neighborhoods across America. Won't You Be My Neighbor? Even though the majority of Americans like their neighbors, most are picky: 75% prefer that their neighbors have particular traits, characteristics, or behaviors. Among all respondents (not just those with preferences), 35% said it was important to them that their neighbors are homeowners, including 51% of respondents who were homeowners themselves. More than race, age, education, politics, and religion, one in three (33%) Americans said it was important that they and their neighbors speak the same language. Among the respondents who really care who their neighbors are - that is, those that said that the neighbors were a very important consideration when choosing their home - 40% want neighbors who speak the same language. Even though only 10% of respondents said it was important that neighbors are of the same race or ethnicity as they are, language was important - and language differences often go hand in hand with racial or ethnic differences. \"It is important to me that my neighbors...\" All respondents Respondents who say neighbors \"very important\" in choosing current home Suburban respondents Urban respondents Are homeowners 35% 39% 38% 29% Speak the same language as me 33% 40% 34% 27% Are as involved with our neighborhood as I am 22% 31% 22% 24% Have lived in our neighborhood a long time 22% 31% 22% 23% Have the same family structure as me 16% 25% 17% 13% Keep the same hours as I do 13% 17% 12% 15% Are of the same race or ethnicity as me 10% 17% 11% 8% Are the same age as me 9% 12% 8% 10% Have children of the same ages as mine 8% 14% 8% 9% Have the same education level as me 7% 11% 6% 8% Have the same political views as me 4% 5% 3% 5% Practice the same religion as me 3% 6% 3% 2% Overall, suburbanites are pickier about their neighbors than urban dwellers, even though the urbanites live closer to their neighbors. Suburbanites were more likely than urbanites to want neighbors who are homeowners (38% for suburbanites vs. 29% for urbanites) and who speak the same language (34% vs. 27%). It's also more important for suburbanites to have neighbors who have a similar family structure (like married, having kids, etc.), race or ethnicity, and religion. Urbanites, however, were more likely than suburbanites to want neighbors who keep the same hours, have same education level, and have same political views. (All of the differences called out in this paragraph are statistically significant at the 10% level.) Furthermore, urbanites yearn for a greater sense of community. The number one thing people wish their neighborhood had more of is local restaurants. But the second most popular wish in urban areas is for a stronger sense of community, which 26% of urban dwellers want, compared with only 20% of suburbanites. \"I wish my neighborhood had more ...\" All Suburban Urban Local restaurants 27% 26% 29% Local grocery shopping options 22% 22% 22% Sense of community 22% 20% 26% Parks 21% 21% 23% Peace and quiet 20% 19% 23% Public transportation options 18% 19% 17% Local commercial shopping options 17% 17% 18% Local coffee shops 16% 14% 21% Block parties 15% 16% 16% Police presence 15% 13% 19% Community pools 14% 14% 14% Private security guards/Neighborhood watch members 11% 10% 14% Families with children 9% 9% 10% Highway access options 6% 6% 7% There Goes the Neighborhood Although most people like their neighbors - which means most of your neighbors probably like you - you should probably stay on guard. Some neighbors, even the friendly ones, can be judgmental, passive-aggressive, or be a little on the nosy side. One fifth of Americans say they judge their neighbors based on the appearance or condition of their home or property. But passive-aggressive neighbors are more common than judgy neighbors: 31% would actively ignore a neighbor they were in a disagreement with, and 30% would complain to a higher authority. Finally, some neighbors get awfully curious when a neighbor's home goes up for sale: 27% check out the home online, and 11% attend the open house. Statement % choosing or agreeing with statement If I were in a disagreement with a neighbor, I would actively ignore them 31% If I were in a disagreement with a neighbor, I would complain to landlord, homeowners' association, police, or other local authority 30% When a home goes up for sale in my neighborhood, I check out the home on an online real estate site 27% I judge my neighbors on the appearance or condition of their home or property 20% When a home goes up for sale in my neighborhood, I attend the open house 11% Still, most Americans like their neighbors - despite the fact most would prefer that their neighbors are homeowners, speak the same language, or have other traits similar to themselves - even if they don't know their names. And although few people say that their prospective neighbors were a very important consideration when they chose their current home, most end up liking their neighbors after all. METHODOLOGY This survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Interactive on behalf of Trulia from September 25-27, 2013 among 3,014 adults ages 18 and older. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. For complete survey methodology, including weighting variables, please contact pr@trulia.com. To compare \"city\" versus \"suburb,\" we classify neighborhoods as either urban or suburban based on how dense or spread out the housing is. We define urban neighborhoods as those where a majority of the housing is apartments, attached townhouses, or other multi-unit buildings; suburban neighborhoods are those where a majority of the housing is single-family detached houses. We used this methodology rather than simply identifying the biggest city in a metro as \"urban\" and treating the rest of the metro as the \"suburbs,\" as other reports on cities-versus-suburbs often do. The problem with using city boundaries is that many neighborhoods outside of the biggest city are actually much more urban than some neighborhoods within a city's boundary. For instance, our definition classifies Hoboken, NJ, Central Square in Cambridge, MA, and Santa Monica - which are all very dense - as urban neighborhoods, even though they're outside the city boundaries of New York, Boston, and Los Angeles, respectively.", "By Jeff Russell, B. Comm., MA Published : September 13, 2016 Which Is the Fastest Growing Economy in 2017? When the discussion comes to naming the fastest-growing economy in the world, China seems to always be under the spotlight. But there\u2019s a whole other world out there, full of countries that are also undergoing explosive growth. You may even be surprised to learn that China doesn\u2019t top the fastest-growing economies list. The following list of the fastest-growing economies in the world is based on 2017 growth projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). (Source: \"World Economic Outlook October 2016,\" International Monetary Fund, last accessed October 5, 2016.) Take a look at our list of the top 10 fastest-growing emerging economies in the world. 10. Nigeria 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 0.6% Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest country and economy, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of about $490.0 billion in 2015. The country is rich in resources, especially oil, but it is moving toward a service sector economy. In 2014, the country reached a record GDP of $568.51 billion, when the service sector contributed 57% to Nigeria\u2019s growth. As the country is reliant on oil, its economy has faced some scrutiny. But if you look at the long term, Nigeria\u2019s growth has been simply amazing. Over the past decade, Nigeria\u2019s government has made economic reforms to accelerate growth. From 2000 to 2012, Nigeria\u2019s GDP per capita has roughly doubled, from about $1,400 per person to about $2,800 per person. 9. Colombia 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 2.7% Colombia is one of the biggest economic hubs in Latin America. Petroleum is the country\u2019s main export, accounting for about 45% of total exports. Colombia\u2019s government has made sound economic policies and has aggressively made free trade agreements in recent years to stimulate economic growth. Growth in 2014 was 4.4%. Sadly, low oil prices have impacted the growth rate for the country. Its long-term outlook remains solid regardless. 8. Turkey 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 3.0% Turkey\u2019s free market economy is increasingly driven by its industry and service sectors, although employment in agriculture still accounts for about 25% of its workforce. The country\u2019s government has recently undergone steps to privatize institutions and reduce state involvement in basic industry, banking, transport, and communication. The emerging middle class is adding vigor to the economy and helping to expand production beyond the traditional textile and clothing sectors. 7. Romania 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 3.8% Romania joined the European Union in 2007 and has since made considerable economic reforms to its institutions to align it with a market economy and stimulate economic growth. Domestic consumption and foreign direct investment have helped drive that growth. Romania has a diversified economy, but its service sector is growing, accounting for about 52% of GDP, while agriculture and industry accounts for 12% and 36% of GDP, respectively. Poverty used to be a huge problem for Romania, but the country\u2019s explosive economic growth has greatly alleviated it. 6. Egypt 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 4.0% Since 2000, Egypt\u2019s government underwent economic reforms to attract foreign direct investment and spur economic growth. The reforms and policies helped Egypt\u2019s economy grow at a rate of eight percent annually between 2004 and 2009. Egypt\u2019s growth rate over the past decade has taken a hit since the 2011 revolution. The country\u2019s government faces numerous challenges as to how to get back up to past growth rates by restoring market and investor confidence. Regardless, the country continues to accelerate at a decent pace. 5. Pakistan 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 5.0% Pakistan is currently liberalizing its economy, including privatization of all government corporations, with the goal of attracting foreign direct investment. About 40% of the country\u2019s population is employed in the agricultural sector, but economic growth is being led by foreign direct investment and the services sector. Pakistan has made substantial reductions in poverty. It fell from 35% in 2002 to about 13.6% in 2011. With a solid growth rate expected going forward, it wouldn\u2019t be shocking to see the poverty rate decline further. 4. Indonesia 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 5.3% Indonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia and the 16th largest economy in the world. Even though economic growth has slowed down in recent years, the country\u2019s growth is still outputting impressive numbers. Gross national income per capita has grown aggressively since 2000. In 2000, GDP per capita was $560.00, rising to $3,650.00 in 2014. Indonesia has also made great strides toward reducing poverty, more than halving the poverty rate to 11.2% in 2014. Indonesia is in the third phase of a 20-year development plan that will focus on infrastructure development, education, and healthcare. These, along with foreign direct investment, will be the main drivers of growth. 3. China 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 6.2% Since the 1970s, China\u2019s government has reformed its economy from a closed, centrally planned system to more of an open market-oriented one. The restructuring of the economy and reforms have led to an over-tenfold increase in GDP since 1978. In 2010, China became the world\u2019s largest exporter, as it has become a manufacturing powerhouse. Over the past two years, there\u2019s been a significant amount of noise that suggests that China\u2019s headed toward a slowdown. Despite this, the country continues to register phenomenal growth rates. 2. Bangladesh 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 6.9% Bangladesh\u2019s economy has grown about six percent annually since 1996. Cheap labor and a young consumer base of about 160 million (with increasing purchasing power) have led this development. More than half of the country\u2019s GDP comes from the services sector, even though about 50% of the population is employed in agriculture, with rice being the largest product. The country\u2019s main export is garments, accounting for more than 80% of total exports and surpassing $25.0 billion in 2015. 1. India 2017 GDP Growth Estimate: 7.6% India is developing into an open-market economy, as its government is taking steps toward economic liberalization. Measures such as industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reduced controls on foreign investment that began in the early 1990s accelerated the country\u2019s growth to about seven percent annually per year from 1997 to 2011. The services sector is the major source of growth, even though about half of the workforce is employed in agriculture, accounting for about two-thirds of GDP.", "(CNN) In recent years, FIFA has made news not just for enforcing rules on the soccer field, but also for allegedly breaking them off it. The body that governs soccer, the most popular sport in the world, is a multibillion-dollar behemoth. Great power, yes. Great responsibility? Not so much, critics say. FIFA has been regularly accused of bribery and kickbacks, allegations that reached a fever pitch after it awarded Russia and Qatar the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, respectively. Afterward, the group carried out its own internal investigation and cleared itself. So why is the United States, a country where soccer ranks far below football and basketball in popularity, now taking top FIFA officials to court on corruption charges Most of the 14 people indicted aren't Americans. But as U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch lays it out, the suspects planned their crimes in the U.S.; they used the U.S. banking system; they planned to profit through schemes that targeted the \"growing U.S. market for soccer.\" \"This is a U.S. case,\" David Zirin, sports editor for The Nation magazine, said Wednesday on CNN. In order to understand how, we'll have to take you through a journey that, as you'll see, involves Americans at all stages. First up ... Michael Garcia Michael Garcia: The World Cup is a big deal. It comes around every four years, and when it does, it's the biggest sporting spectacle on the planet. When FIFA awarded the 2018 games to Russia and followed that with the even more head-scratching choice of Qatar in 2022, critics and other governments cried foul. They smelled shenanigans. They wanted a transparent account of the bidding process to see if Qatar and Russia cut any corners. FIFA brought in Michael Garcia, a onetime U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. He was tasked with looking into the behavior of the two nations. He spent 19 months scrutinizing the bids to host the two tournaments. By the time he was done, his findings stretched to 350 pages. So what did FIFA do? It suppressed the report, released a puny 42-page summary -- and cleared itself of any wrongdoing in November. Garcia hit back. He labeled FIFA's findings on his report \"incomplete and erroneous.\" Then you have ... Loretta Lynch James Comey and Loretta Lynch: As we mentioned earlier, Garcia is a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The guy who held that job before him? James Comey. He's the current FBI director. And the corruption charges are a result of a three-year FBI investigation. Then there's the second New York connection: Attorney General Loretta Lynch She oversaw the case in Brooklyn before she was appointed to lead the Justice Department. But why did U.S. authorities start looking into FIFA to begin with? When FIFA cleared itself of wrongdoing, the FBI wasn't ready to do the same. It wanted to know whether any of the allegations of bribe-taking and kickbacks by FIFA officials took place on American soil. Enter ... Chuck Blazer sits behind FIFA President Joseph Blatter in 2011 in Switzerland. Chuck Blazer Chuck Blazer, an American, was the No. 2 man in CONCACAF, the FIFA-affiliated governing body for North America and the Caribbean. The organization has its headquarters in Florida. Blazer had found himself in a bind. He had amassed $11 million in unreported income, the IRS said, and he hadn't paid his taxes for many, many years. He was looking at some serious prison time. He pleaded guilty in 2013 on corruption charges and became a wire-wearing informant for the feds. He provided documents and recordings of meetings with FIFA colleagues that hinted at not-so-kosher dealings, law enforcement officials said. That meant looking into the dealings of ... Jeffrey Webb, head of CONCACAF CONCACAF Remember when we mentioned CONCACAF? U.S. soccer falls under that governing body. With Blazer as a cooperating witness, American officials set out to see whether corruption touched tournaments held in the Americas. The feds say it did. One of the people facing charges now is Jeffrey Webb. He's a FIFA vice president; he heads CONCACAF; and he was Blazer's boss. Webb \"used his position of trust to solicit bribes from sports marketing executives,\" acting U.S. Attorney Kelly T. Currie of the Eastern District of New York said In return, they provided media, marketing and sponsorship rights to soccer matches in the Americas. Prosecutors said those arrested accepted bribes and kickbacks totaling more than $100 million, from the early 1990s until now. For example, $110 million in bribes changed hands in bringing Copa America , a soccer tournament usually held in South America, to the United States in 2016, Lynch said. But can the U.S. actually go after FIFA officials? Yes. Because it is ... The seal of the FBI The United States of America: The United States brought charges against the suspects because the plots were allegedly hatched on American soil. \"According to U.S. request, these crimes were agreed and prepared in the U.S., and payments were carried out via U.S. banks,\" the Swiss Office of Justice said. Prosecutors also say they think the broad reach of U.S. tax and banking regulations aid their ability to bring the charges. In addition, U.S. authorities claim jurisdiction because the American television market, and billions paid by U.S. networks, is the largest for the World Cup.", "[Daily Advice] Do Not Buy a Car Until You Read This This is the one simple truth car salesman and dealerships don\u2019t want you to know. Most people looking for a car that have had a job for 3+ months that pays more than $1,800 per month can drive away in a new car today. And the best part is, any credit is accepted from good to bad, or even no credit. Additionally, even with foreclosures, bankruptcy, or repossessed cars, there\u2019s still an excellent possibility drivers can qualify for fair interest rates. This is the one simple truth car salesman and dealerships don\u2019t want you to know. Most people looking for a car that have had a job for 3+ months that pays more than $1,800 per month can drive away in a new car today. And the best part is, any credit is accepted from good to bad, or even no credit. Additionally, even with foreclosures, bankruptcy, or repossessed cars, there\u2019s still an excellent possibility drivers can qualify for fair interest rates. But do you think your auto loan company will tell you that? When Canadian car buyers enter their postal code and information at EasyAuto123.com , many are shocked at the results they find. We weren\u2019t surprised when we got questions from car buyers if these rates are real. The truth is people say it\u2018s possible to spend as low as $147 /month with $0 down on their car payment2 and some say they were eligible for lower rates due to new government programs. When we heard about these claims, we decided to investigate for ourselves. We sent out our very own Tim Palmer to test these online comparison services and see if they lived up to the hype. After a few days of research what he found was very exciting. \"A few years ago I went through a foreclosure and my credit took a big hit,\" Tim told us.\"I applied online and was amazed that I qualified for a Ford Escape for the low rate of $166.72 /mo. \"3 Tim\u2019s circumstances may vary from your own so we suggest applying today to see what you qualify for. Tim found that many people with bad or no credit are indeed able to get a car the same day using car loan comparison websites like EasyAuto123.com \u2013 offering the lowest rates possible. What most people don\u2019t realize is a car loan agent typically makes money off of the loans they sell, so the higher the premium the more they can get paid.

Unable to identify the creatures and what kind of help they might need, he called the Daursky Nature Reserve. Little did he know that he had just begun a journey that would change his life. When a Russian farmer found four strange little kittens in his barn, their eyes hadn\u2019t even opened yet. They were going to need a lot of help if they were going to survive. radzhana-daur.livejournal.com He called the Daursky Nature Reserve. The reserve quickly identified the animals as Pallas\u2019s cats, also known as manuls, a rare species of wild cat that is native to Central Asia. radzhana-daur.livejournal.com Manuls are the same size as domestic cats, but there are some big differences. Their build is stockier, their legs are shorter, and their fur is thicker so that they can survive in harsh climate. Their faces are wider and ears are flatter, as well. radzhana-daur.livejournal.com They decided to see if two domestic cats at the facility would nurse the babies. Luckily, the cats took them in and nursed them as their own, saving their lives. The kittens began to grow, and the reserve\u2019s staff began to fall in love! radzhana-daur.livejournal.com The cats flourished at the reserve, and their caretakers knew what the next step would be. As sad as it was to say goodbye, they would be sending these kitties into the wild, back where they belong. radzhana-daur.livejournal.com See what happened on the next page!", "Initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell. Claims, which count the number of people who applied for unemployment insurance for the first time since the past week, fell to 234,000. This marks the 101st week straight of claims being below 300,000. Economists had forecast that claims would tick up slightly to 249,000, up from the prior week's unrevised reading of 246,000. Moreover, the four-week moving came came in at 244,250, which is the lowest level since November 3, 1973 when it was 244,000.

Pokemon has been around for what seems like forever, well actually 20 years now. For some of you readers, Pokemon may have been around since before you were born, which makes me feel even older considering I played link-battles on the school bus with my friends. With Nintendo's upcoming release of two new Pokemon titles, Pokemon Sun and Moon, I don't think they ever thought that their beloved games would wind up getting so complicated. But when you starting renaming one of the most famous characters in the franchise, it's easy to see why things are getting so complicated. With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see: Now Nintendo wants to unify them: Poke\u0301mon in Greater China will be officially called \u7cbe\u9748\u5bf6\u53ef\u5922, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Poke\u0301mon). Earlier in Hong Kong, it was \u5bf5\u7269\u5c0f\u7cbe\u9748 Pet Little Elves (or Spirits), while in Taiwan, it was \u795e\u5947\u5bf6\u8c9d, Magic Babies. This probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists. Hong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin. Because Pokemon Sun and Moon will be translated into Mandarin now, it's causing a stir because Pikachu now has a new name! That's Right, I said it, Pikachu is now Pikaqiu Pikachu was originally translated as \u6bd4\u5361\u8d85 (Bei-kaa-chyu) in Hong Kong. Now it is named \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 (Pikaqiu). While the name \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 in Mandarin sounds similar to the global name Pikachu (as it was always called in China and Taiwan), it reads as Pei-kaa-jau in Cantonese, which doesn\u2019t sound the same at all. Fans of the bright electric mouse have been protesting NIntendo's translating choice saying that they will never buy from Nintendo again. Although the protest has gained over 6,000 signatures for a petition against the decision, it looks as though Nintendo is sticking with the new translation.", "The House passed a bill on Wednesday that would delay the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s new ozone regulations for perhaps another decade -- a move that could endanger the health of millions of Americans. The EPA\u2019s October 2015 regulations lowered the limit for ground-level ozone pollution -- otherwise known as smog, which forms when nitrogen oxide reacts with volatile organic compounds in the air. The rules had been in the works for seven years, and even the updated standard was not low enough to please a number of public health and environmental groups. But business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argue that the new standard is too strict and will hurt industry. They scored a win with the House bill, sponsored by Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas), which would push back implementation of the rules by 10 years. Olson said in a statement that the bill is simply a \"common sense\" effort to provide \"needed flexibility so that states and localities can adequately achieve new, lower standards with time for compliance.\" Business advocates are understandably pleased. \"Manufacturers are encouraged to see House leaders pursue much-needed legislation to reduce the burdens and inflexibilities associated with the 2015 ozone standards,\" said Ross Eisenberg, NAM's vice president of energy and resources policy, in a statement. But environmental, science and health advocacy groups contend that such a delay would increase dangerous air pollution. On June 7, 116 organizations signed a letter warning that the bill \"could well result in communities being exposed to unhealthy levels of smog and soot and sulfur dioxide and even toxic lead pollution.\" The White House has made it clear that President Barack Obama would veto the bill if it passed the Senate, releasing a statement on Tuesday that said it \"would jeopardize progress toward cleaner air and significantly delay health benefits worth billions of dollars for millions of Americans.\" Ozone pollution can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including asthma attacks, wheezing and increased risk of stroke and early death, according to the American Lung Association. The dangers are considered even greater for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and people with pre-existing lung and heart conditions.", "Pizza Hut may be used to making headlines for various insane pizzas but it turns out the company is an innovator of more than just bizarre crusts.

The famous talk show host's travel picks might surprise you. Today, Forbes released its first-ever ranking of the wealthiest American celebrities, giving a peek into the bank accounts of some of the richest people on the planet. Most interesting to us here at Women@Forbes are the women on the list: self-made celebs for whom money is no object and who travel in private planes, sail on sleek yachts, stay in expensive villas and own multimillion-dollar vacation homes. Because we are travel obsessed, we decided to take a look at how the other half   actually, the top 1% of the 1%   spends their vacation time. Women In The Forbes Top 20 Oprah Winfrey's horse farm in California. (Photo courtesy of Sage Auctions/Lands of America) Oprah Winfrey: net worth $2.8 billion The richest woman on the Forbes list has deemed 2017 the Year of Adventure in the January 2017 issue of O. For the cover story of the magazine, Oprah Winfrey even jetted off to one of the nation's most dramatic natural wonders: the Grand Canyon. And yet, she confesses in the magazine's pages that she's actually a homebody. It makes sense: Earlier this year Winfrey bought a $28.9 million equestrian ranch in California. On the 42-acre property is a 4,800-square-foot house with four fireplaces and a pool, plus plenty of horse stables and riding rings. This isn't Winfrey's only cushy crash pad: She also owns a $14 million mountaintop ski chalet in Telluride, Colorado with its own wine mine, as well as over-the-top properties in Santa Barbara, California, and Maui.  Madonna walks along a street in Havana. (Photo courtesy of YAMIL LAGE/AFP/Getty Images) Madonna: net worth $560 million The next woman on the list is the travel-obsessed Material Girl herself, Madonna. She has made most of her riches due to her concert tours (which have grossed a staggering $1.4 billion). For her birthday this August, Madonna jetted off to Cuba with her children and a group of close friends. They danced on tables at a bar in Havana, toured the city in vintage 1950s cars and stayed at the Hotel Saratoga. In the past year alone, the Queen of Pop has had a number of glamorous trips. She has also been spotted in the southern Italy town of Puglia for a friend's wedding; in the African countries of Kenya and Malawi with her adopted children; and in London, just to name a few. And that's not all: Madonna also owns a horse farm in the tony Hamptons enclave of Bridgehampton, a triple-wide townhouse in Manhattan and she reportedly bought a $20 million penthouse in Tel Aviv. It's no wonder one of Madonna's most famous songs is Holiday   she lives it. It's no wonder Barbra Streisand escapes to Malibu, with scenery like this.

Her escape of choice: a clifftop oceanfront compound in the California beach town of Malibu, where Barbra has her own personal shopping arcade that includes stores where she can display her collections of antiques. The singer and her husband James Brolin also like to escape to places like the Spanish island of Mallorca and St. Tropez on the French Riviera.

One noteworthy property is Casa Elizabeth, the Palm Springs estate that used to belong to Elizabeth Taylor and has been dubbed The Jewel of the Desert. Ireland originally designed the four-bedroom five-bath property for Taylor. Other locations for Ireland's staggeringly beautiful vacation villas: Greece, Hawaii and Fiji.

Her new $8.9 million mansion in Naples, Florida mansion is more like a resort, with multiple bedrooms, a lagoon and three waterfalls, no less. She also owns a nine-bedroom manor house in Greenwich, Connecticut; a five-bedroom condo at the luxe Montage Beverly Hills hotel; and an $8.5 million duplex penthouse in Manhattan. It's hard to imagine she has any free time with so many residences, but Judge Judy has also been known to strut her stuff in spots like the Exumas, a chain of islands in the Bahamas.

A new study from the University of Washington\u2019s Foster School of Business found that despite working the same amount of time, a worker who starts the day earlier will come off as more conscientious, and consequently receive better performance reviews, than someone who starts later. Past studies have shown that giving workers a little leeway in setting their hours makes them happier and more productive -- presumably a win for both the employee and the company. That's why companies like Google and Microsoft let employees work from home or adjust their schedules to account for personal responsibilities, like taking a child to school in the morning. But the study suggests a downside: Your boss may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time, regardless of how much work you're getting done. In the study, which will be published in full in the Journal of Applied Psychology later this year, researchers asked 149 supervisors to rate an employee\u2019s performance; employee start times ranged from 5 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. Even when employees who started later in the day worked the same number of hours as those who started earlier, supervisors were inclined to rate employees who began work earlier as more conscientious, and gave them higher performance ratings. Bosses who preferred to work later hours themselves were less inclined to display this \"morning bias.\" In a second experiment, the researchers assigned a group of 141 college students the role of a supervisor, and asked each student to review a profile of a fictitious employee. The performance of the fictional employee was the same in all cases, but start time varied across profiles. Researchers found that employees who worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. were consistently given higher ratings of conscientiousness and performance by the student supervisors than employees who worked from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. The researchers concluded that employees who can opt for flexible work schedules should shift their schedules earlier, not later, to account for managers' morning bias. \"It seems likely that some employees are experiencing a decrement in their performance ratings that is not based on anything having to do with their actual performance,\" the three researchers wrote in a post for the Harvard Business Review. This \"morning bias\" appears to be deeply ingrained. In a word-association experiment designed to test the implicit stereotype that early risers are more diligent workers, the researchers also found that a majority of the 120 working adults surveyed linked words associated with the morning (like \"sunrise\") with words associated with conscientiousness (like \"industriousness\"). Another recent study covered by the New York Times further suggests there may be an implicit view among some managers that employees who take advantage of flexible work policies in any way are less conscientious than employees who work more \"traditional\" hours. \"Most organizations still treat workplace flexibility as an accommodation,\" Erin Kelly, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, told the Times. \"You are implicitly saying, \u2018Most of us will be working these traditional ways and the rewards will come to those working these traditional ways.\u2019 And that is where you have this stigma or career penalties.\" Although the study did not consider gender, it seems women could be more adversely affected by morning biases than men. That's because more women than men are primary caregivers for their children and assume a disproportionate amount of household tasks, according to a 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Studies have shown that women take advantage of workplace telecommuting policies more often than men for the same reason -- and that their careers may suffer as a result of not logging as much face time at the office.", "Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport has topped Beijing International to retain the title of \"world's busiest airport,\" according to Airports Council International (ACI). The Atlanta airport had 96 million passengers in 2014, compared to 86 million who passed through Beijing last year, according to the group that monitors worldwide airport traffic. Atlanta's margin over the second-place airport decreased from a 10.7 million spread in 2013, but traffic at the airport itself went up from 94.4 million that year. The airport group said the growth is a sign of the popularity of air travel in the face of challenging economic factors in several areas of the world. \"Passenger traffic remained resilient in the face of the global uncertainties that beleaguered many economies in 2013 and 2014,\" ACI World Director General Angela Gittens said in a statement. \"International tourism, in particular, was irrepressible in 2014 considering the geopolitical risks that have persisted in certain parts of the world, such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East,\" she continued. \"The Ebola outbreak also presented significant challenges to the aviation sector. Notwithstanding, by and large, the international traveller in 2014 appears to have been immune to these potential dangers. Overall global passenger traffic grew at a rate of over 5 percent. This is above the 4.3 percent average annual growth rate in passenger traffic from 2004 to 2014.\" The title of \"world's busiest airport\" has become a coveted position that allows a city to crow about its attractiveness to visitors. Hartsfield-Jackson has been the passenger traffic titleholder since the 1990s, although the airport group said this year Chicago's O'Hare International Airport had more airplane takeoffs and landings. Los Angeles International Airport was the second-busiest domestic airport \u2014 and fifth worldwide \u2014 in terms of passenger numbers, with 70 million passengers. Chicago's O'Hare was in third place domestically \u2014 seventh overall \u2014 with 69 million.", "With the two year anniversary of the Nepal earthquake approaching, the capital is back on its feet. Now's the time to go, says Martin Symington Why go now? There\u2019s a compelling reason for visiting in 2017. Every rupee spent in hotels and restaurants, shops, taxis or temples, is helping Kathmandu back on to its feet. Nearly two years after the earthquake which devastated swathes of Nepal and severely damaged the capital, Kathmandu is bouncing back to its alluring self with astonishing verve. Rebuilding and restoration is proceeding apace while tourists are returning to bathe in the Himalayan city\u2019s sensory overload: temples and squares; prayer flags and sputtering scooters; merchants yelling behind marigold-garlanded stalls amid wafts of incense, spices and holy cow dung. Get your bearings The old city, known as Durbar Square, lies at the centre of Kathmandu. To its north, frenetic Thamel is a maze of hotels, restaurants, trekking agencies and shops. To the south, the Bagmati River borders peaceful Patan district with its own Durbar Square and expatriate communities. Beyond the former Royal Palace to the east are the smarter shopping centres and embassies. Local tempos (minibuses) and buses are best avoided \u2013 they're crowded, slow and not the safest. However, taxis are cheap and plentiful and rickshaws can be a useful way of travelling short distances. Take a view Puff your way up the 400-step stone staircase to the Buddhist stupa of Swayambhunath (1), known as \u2018Monkey Temple\u2019 on account of the hundreds of \u2018holy\u2019 monkeys who will be your chattering, food-begging companions. If the day is clear, the whole of Kathmandu valley unfurls at your feet. You will see from here how localised the earthquake damage was; isolated pockets have collapsed like cards while large areas remained more or less unscathed.  Take a hike Nowhere is the localised nature of the earthquake damage more apparent that in the area known as Durbar Square, a riot of ancient palaces, temples and royal monuments which comprise the UNESCO-listed historic heart of Kathmandu. Start at the northern, Thamel end check post (2) where tourists pay an entrance fee of 1000Rs (about \u00a37.70) fee for free run of the whole area. Join throngs of pilgrims at Shiva-dedicated Mahendreshwar Mandir (3) with its chiming bells and flickering candles. Follow the flow down to Jagannath Mandir (4), a Hindu temple which attracts gawping fascination on account of its athletic and imaginative erotic carvings which seems to suggest that the earth has always moved in these parts. If it\u2019s between 10am and noon, keep an eye out \u2013 the Kumari Devi, or living \u2018child-goddess\u2019 might put in an appearance at her window above the courtyard of her magnificently carved sacred home, the Kumari Dar (5). However, now that you are down at the south end of the historic region, the heartrending extend of the earthquake damage becomes unavoidable. Cordoned off for safety is the red brick old Royal Palace, (6) whose walls are now cracked, while the adjacent Basantapur Tower (7) somehow remain precariously erect. Exit via \u2018Freak Street\u2019 (official name Jochne) (8), the legendary 1960s hippy hangout (though its glory days are now over). Lunch on the run Climb six flights of stairs to the rooftop Kasthamandap Cafe\u0301 (9) at 23 Maru (00 977 1 6219177, no web) for an open-air coffee and snack under a sun umbrella. There are commanding views over Durbar Square. Window shopping The Thamel district, north of Durbar Square, survived the earthquake more or less intact and remains the backpacker hub (a successor to Freak Street). It\u2019s a carnival of noisy alleys and tiny squares, packed with hundreds of trekking agencies and shops hawking everything from tourist tat to genuine Tibetan antiques. One good bet for quality thanka paintings and woven rugs, is Amrita Craft (10) on Chhetrapait. An aperitif Owner Prakash will probably be around to welcome you in person to Zibro (11) on Chaksibari Marg (00 977 984 1059449, no web), his laid-back rooftop bar where young Nepalis shoot the breeze with holidaying Indians and European travellers. The music is on multi-cultural message too, with songs from little known local bands playing Nepali folk-rock fusion in the background. It\u2019s a great place to make new friends over a glass of local craft beer Khumbu Kolsch. Dine with the locals At Bhojan Griha (12), on Dilli Bazaar in the eastern district of Kathmandu, traditional \u2018Newari\u2019 dishes are served to guests in a 19th-century mansion, restored with painstaking attention to detail. Dishes include buffalo meat or vegetable-filled momo dumplings, and duck with peanuts and spiced lentils. The restaurant says that all produce is organic and no plastic is used. Mains around \u00a36-8. Take a ride For the ride of your life, board a small propeller plane for a dawn \u2018Mountain Flight\u2019 along the crest of the Himalayas. You\u2019ll pass up close and personal many of the world\u2019s highest peaks, including Mount Everest. Flights are in the early mornings when conditions are generally clearest, but good views are weather-dependent and weather-related cancellations are frequent.  An hour-long flight with Buddha Air costs US$192 (\u00a3158). Sunday morning: out to brunch La Dolce Vita (13), at Chaksibhari Marg (00 977 1 4700612, no web), doesn\u2019t have the best coffee in Kathmandu, but what it lacks in a caffeine fix it makes up for with delicious Italian pastries, pasta and gnocchi, sprinkled with grated yak\u2019s cheese. Sit on the sunny terrace watching the street dramas of chaotic Thamel below. Open from 11am, meals around \u00a38-10. A walk in the park It says a lot that Swapna Bagaicha (14) on Kaiser Mahal, Tridevi Marg, is also known as the Garden of Dreams. A botanical park and serene retreat from the frenetic city, it\u2019s just a few minutes\u2019 walk from central Thamel. Sadly, the park took a hard hit in the earthquake, damaging some of the neo-classical pavilions, statues, ponds and fountains. Nevertheless, the plants are still lovingly tended and the Rs 200 (\u00a31.50) entrance fee is being put to good restorative use. Cultural afternoon The historic Buddhist city of Patan \u2013 effectively a suburb of Kathmandu \u2013 is a 20-minute taxi ride across the tea-coloured Bagmati River. Patan is a repository of temples, palaces and stupas strewn around its own Durbar Square. Sadly, several of these took hits in the earthquake. The fac\u0327ade of the Kwa Bahal (15), also known as the Golden Temple, is one almost untouched highlight; the four giant, prayer flag-festooned Ashoka Stupas (16) are another. And then there\u2019s the fact it\u2019s guarded by scores of \u2018holy tortoises\u2019.

When a fan asked Rowling what form Hagrid's Patronus would take \u2013 a great question, considering Hagrid's unusual taste in pets \u2013 she replied : \"Hagrid couldn't produce a Patronus. It's a very difficult spell.\" In both the books and the films, the Patronus charm is one of the most powerful defense spells a witch or wizard can cast to ward off Dementors, the dark creatures that feed off human happiness. It's one of the most complex spells in the wizarding world, and in order to conjure a Patronus, a wizard needs to draw upon his most powerful happy memory. The Charm conjures a magical guardian in the shape of the animal with whom the witch or wizard shares the greatest affinity. Rowling's response may point to the fact that the spell is simply too difficult for Hagrid, who was expelled from Hogwarts as a teenager, to perform. But fans were also worried that the lovable half-giant, abandoned by his mother as a child, may just not have enough happy memories to produce a Patronus. Oh, Hagrid!", "Um, so, Oxford University is older than the Aztecs. THE AZTECS. 1. Cleopatra lived closer in time to the invention of Snapchat than to the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Cleopatra died a little more than 2,000 years ago in 30 BCE, while the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed around 2560 BCE. That\u2019s a difference of more than 2,500 years. 2. Also, the Great Pyramid was older to the Romans than the Romans are to us. Even in its earlier years, the Roman Empire was still further removed from the construction of the Great Pyramid than they are from us. 3. Oh, and the Stegosaurus was older to the Tyrannosaurus rex than the T. rex is to us. Not only did they not exist at the same time, but the T. rex (which lived 85 to 65 million years ago) became a species about 74 million years after the Stegosaurus died out. 4. The oldest living person was born closer to the signing of the US Constitution than to today. Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, the oldest living person today at age 117, was born in 1899. That\u2019s 112 years after the signing of the Constitution, which was signed in 1787. 5. The 10th president of the United States has two grandchildren who are alive today. John Tyler had a son, Lyon Tyler, at age 63. Lyon went on to have children late in life as well, including Lyon Tyler Jr. and Harrison Tyler, both of whom are alive today...and are only in their eighties. 6. Oxford University is older than the Aztec civilization. Oxford began teaching in some form all the way back in the year 1096. By most accounts, the Aztecs didn\u2019t begin their civilization until the beginning of the 13th century. 7. Harvard University was founded before Isaac Newton published his laws of motion and gravity. While not nearly as old as Oxford, Harvard is still an old university. It was founded in 1636, almost 50 years before Isaac Newton published his Principia Mathematica in 1687, which outlined his laws of motion and law of universal gravitation. 8. We made it to the moon only 66 years after the Wright brothers invented human flight. The Wright brothers\u2019 first flight was in 1903, and the Apollo 11 moon landing was in 1969. There\u2019s so much Americans can accomplish when we get in a pissing contest with Russia. 9. Woolly mammoths were still alive when the Great Pyramid at Giza was built. In fact, the pyramid was roughly 1,000 years old when the mammoths went extinct completely, which wasn\u2019t until about 1560 BCE. 10. When the first Star Wars movie came out, France was still executing people by guillotine. The final execution by guillotine in France occurred in 1977, when a man by the name of Hamida Djandoubi was executed for torturing and killing his girlfriend. That was the same year the first Star Wars movie hit theaters. 11. When the fax machine was invented, people were still traveling the Oregon Trail. The first major wagon train hit the Oregon Trail in 1841. Just two years later, Scottish inventor Alexander Bain created a preliminary version of the modern fax machine. 12. The Ottoman Empire still existed when Paramount Studios was founded. The Ottoman Empire was founded around the year 1300, but it lasted all the way until 1922. Paramount was founded 10 years earlier in 1912. 13. Betty White is older than sliced bread. Speaking of 1922, that\u2019s the year Betty White was born. By contrast, the first commercially produced, automatically sliced loaves of bread weren\u2019t made until 1928. 14. Will Smith is now older than James Avery (Uncle Phil) was when Fresh Prince of Bel-Air started. Not sure how it\u2019s even possible, but Will Smith is now 48 years old. James Avery was 45 when Fresh Prince premiered back in 1990. 15. If they made a That \u201990s Show and waited the same amount of time after the decade as That \u201970s Show waited after the \u201970s, the show would be made in 2017. It might seem like That \u201970s Show was made way after the end of the \u201970s, but that gap is exactly the same as the gap between now and the \u201990s. 16. The Eiffel Tower was inaugurated the same year Nintendo was founded. Most people know that the Eiffel Tower was inaugurated for the 1889 World\u2019s Fair. What you might not know is that Nintendo started out as a playing card company, and was founded in the same year. 17. Anne Frank, Martin Luther King Jr., and Barbara Walters were all born in the same year. Though they\u2019re often thought of as having lived in very different times, Anne Frank, Barbara Walters, and MLK Jr. were all born in 1929. 18. Some of the world\u2019s whales that are alive today were born before Moby-Dick was written. Some bowhead whales are believed to have a lifespan of more than 200 years. Since Moby Dick was published in 1851, that means there may be whales out there who are nearly 50 years older than the book. 19. Pluto didn\u2019t even get to complete one orbit around the sun between the time it was discovered and the time it was declassified as a planet. Pluto was discovered thanks to an observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, back in 1930. It was heartbreakingly demoted in 2006. Because of its distance from the sun, Pluto takes 248 Earth-years to orbit the sun just once. That means it didn\u2019t even get halfway around during the time it was being called a planet. 20. 9/11 happened closer to the fall of the Berlin Wall than to today. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, only 12 years before 9/11, the 15th anniversary of which just passed this year. 21. If the history of the universe were placed on a calendar year, humans would only exist starting around 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31. This was famously outlined by Carl Sagan in Cosmos. If you compressed the entire history of everything, going back to the Big Bang, into a calendar year, all of human history would only take up just a little more than the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the year. 22. More than 6% of all humans who have ever lived are alive today. Thanks to a boom in population growth following advances in technology and medicine, the current human population living on Earth right now is about 6% of the entire human population in the entire history of the planet. 23. Everything you see happened in the past, not the present. Since it takes about 50 milliseconds for visual information to process in your brain, by the time you actually \"see\" something, it happened in the past.", "Grigory Rasputin, a mystic peasant who captivated the Russian imperial court, met his death at the hands of aristocratic enemies 100 years ago. Artem Krechetnikov of BBC Russian examines the grisly murder of Rasputin and finds that some details are more myth than reality. Few characters in Russian history are as well-known as the mystic from Tobolsk in Siberia, whose name is forever linked to scandal. He has been called a \"sex machine\" and \"lover\" of the Tsarina, Alexandra Feodorovna. The first description is probably an exaggeration, and the second is simply false. Russians' opinions of him, at the time and later, ranged from \"holy man\" to \"reptile\". The latter was how the reformist prime minister of the time, Pyotr Stolypin, contemptuously spoke of him. With the outbreak of war in 1914 there was hysteria about \"dark forces around the throne\". The Empress Alexandra, wife of Tsar Nicholas II, believed Rasputin had mystical healing powers that could help her haemophiliac son Alexei, the heir to the throne. Supporters of Russia's alliance with France, keen to see Germany defeated militarily, suspected Rasputin of undermining Russia's foreign policy. In early 1914 Rasputin told an Italian journalist: \"God willing there won't be a war, and I'll get busy on that score.\" Night rendezvous Mystery still shrouds Rasputin's last moments. Why did he go to the palace of Prince Felix Yusupov in St Petersburg? According to two of the assassins - Prince Yusupov and Vladimir Purishkevich, a member of parliament - Yusupov collected Rasputin on the night of 30 December 1916 on the pretext that his wife Irina wanted to meet him. But Irina was actually away at the Yusupovs' estate in Crimea. Yusupov claimed that he took Rasputin into a basement where he fed him cakes laced with poison. But Rasputin allegedly did not succumb, and kept asking to meet Irina upstairs. Yusupov's co-conspirators made lots of noise on the floor above, faking a party, and played the American song Yankee Doodle on the gramophone. But this version of history seems improbable. Political intrigues Rasputin was uneducated, but no fool. The Yusupovs were fabulously rich - Irina was a member of the royal family - so Rasputin could hardly have thought she would let herself be seduced so easily. According to Rasputin's daughter Maria, Russian Interior Minister Alexander Protopopov had warned Rasputin that there was a plot to kill him. He advised him to avoid socialising for a few days, but Rasputin told him \"it's too late\". So it remains a mystery why he visited the Yusupovs. It cannot have been just for the Madeira and jolly music. There were rumours that the Empress Alexandra and Protopopov were planning to dissolve parliament - the Duma - introduce a state of emergency and sue for peace. It was quite feasible for Yusupov to lure Rasputin by promising a meeting with allies of the empress. The rest of the assassins' account of what happened reads like the screenplay of a horror movie. After the poison allegedly failed to work, Yusupov had to open fire, but Rasputin rose up again, like a monster. Even blows to the temple failed to stop Rasputin, who pursued Yusupov out across the courtyard. Then allegedly Purishkevich fired four shots into Rasputin's back, felling him. So, what of the poisoned cakes? People who knew Rasputin well said he always refused sweet things, believing them to be harmful to his special powers. Guards questioned about the murder reported hearing about four shots, in quick succession. A pathologist determined the cause of death to be a shot to the stomach, causing heavy blood loss. No drowning There were contradictory testimonies about the shirt Rasputin was wearing. He may well have been killed before taking off his fur coat. The assassins probably killed him as soon as he stepped inside, shooting him at point-blank range. Five aristocrats, led by Prince Yusupov, were involved, though some speculate that even more participated in the plot. According to another myth, Rasputin's defiance of death was such that the plotters had to drown him in icy water. But the autopsy said: \"No evidence of drowning was found. Rasputin was already dead when he was thrown into the water.\" Yusupov went into exile in Paris after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and lived to 80. Purishkevich was arrested in Petrograd in 1918, then released on the orders of secret police chief Felix Dzerzhinsky. He died of typhus in 1920, during the Russian civil war. The violence and chaos of the revolution and Bolshevik terror make Rasputin's words sound prophetic: \"Without me everything will collapse.\" He had also predicted his own murder, in a letter to Nicholas II. If nobles did it, he warned, it would bring down the monarchy. Communist revolutionaries murdered the royal family in 1918.", "The world can collectively breathe now because Tom Hiddleston is setting the record straight about dating Taylor Swift.

NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri NASA has confirmed that New Orleans and the surrounding areas are sinking at a much higher rate than previously thought. Using airborne radar to map the rate at which the ground is sinking over a period of a few years, they were able to document in fine detail exactly which regions are most at risk, and where planning and building needs to be monitored. The Earth\u2019s surface can sink due to a mixture of natural and man-made causes. The weight of deposited sediment can, for example, cause subsidence, as can the movement of glaciers and the compaction of shallow sediments. But humans can also influence this process by pumping out oil and gas, or in the example of New Orleans, by the withdrawal of water. The extraction of groundwater and dewatering of the region, in which surface water is removed in order to prevent standing water or saturated earth, is causing the city to sink. This has been exasperated by the building of levees, which prevent the natural build-up of sediment that counteract the sinking. The region of Norco is one of the worst affected, sinking 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri This is most acute in regions upriver along the Mississippi River, specifically the industrial areas of Norco and Michoud, where the ground is sinking by a worrying 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. Other areas of concern were in New Orleans Upper and Lower 9th Ward, where the subsidence may be related to the water levels of the Mississippi. Of particular concern is the changes in ground level around the levees built to prevent flooding, as they found regions behind the levees sinking by 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) a year. The data used by NASA to build the maps, published in a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was created using NASA\u2019s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), which is able to track changes in elevation on the Earth\u2019s surface down to a centimeter difference. This by itself can\u2019t tell the researchers what is causing the change in ground level, so they then have to disentangle all the possible causes, which operate at different time and space scales. While the fact that the region is sinking is not new, NASA have highlighted that the degree to which it is happening is much greater than previously thought, and that it could be putting certain regions at a much greater risk of flooding, as if there wasn\u2019t a big enough one to begin with. It is hoped that the data can be used to attempt to reduce or reverse the subsidence in the most severely affected areas, as well as help with planning decisions for the future.", "When you\u2019re stuck in the wilderness, you\u2019ve got to learn how to do things you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily have to. Making a fire is probably first and foremost among those tasks, and there are several well-known ways to do so \u2013 but you\u2019ve most likely never heard of this method before. In the incredibly popular YouTube video below, user NorthSurvival showcases a trick using a lemon, of all things, to start a fire. Now, it\u2019s clear that the likelihood of having nothing but a lemon and several pieces of copper, zinc, electric wire and steel wool to start a fire with ing the wilderness is essentially nonexistent. But rather than a survival tip, this definitely makes for a fun experiment \u2013 as long as you exercise caution. NorthSurvival\u2019s video shows how inserting copper clips and zinc nails into a softened lemon, then connecting the clips and nails with wiring, can produce a short-circuit which will then start a fire, with the help of steel wool and kindling. If this feels reminiscent to a certain grade school science project, it should. The process used to start a fire with a lemon is essentially the same as the one that involves using a lemon to conduct electricity and power a light bulb or a battery. Bright Hub Engineering explains this is due to the copper and zinc creating a breakdown in the atomic structure of the electrodes within both metals and the lemon simultaneously, leading to the generation of a new flow of electrons in the lemon. Be careful: If you attempt this trick yourself, it is important that you use covered wiring like NorthSurvival does in the video \u2013 rubber gloves, even, to be safe \u2013 in order to avoid electrocuting yourself. Because that\u2019s really the last thing you need to be doing in the wild.", "Another Spice Girls reunion may be in the works -- at least if Scary Spice has anything to say about it. Mel B recently spoke to The Daily Mail about the future of the beloved girl band and her hopes for a reunion. \"The truth is I was always the one that wanted the Spice Girls to continue. I didn\u2019t want it to end and I still don\u2019t,\" Mel B told the publication. \"Even though I\u2019ve always had my own career going on, I\u2019m always up for a reunion.

The Spice Girls famously performed together for the first time in years at August 2012's Olympics Closing Ceremony in London.", "The pharmaceutical industry has become a major health hazard to the American people. Our nation pays - by far - the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. As a result of these outrageous prices, nearly one in five Americans cannot afford to fill their prescriptions. Meanwhile, the five largest prescription drug companies made a combined $50 billion in profits last year. That is unacceptable. A lifesaving product does no one any good if a patient cannot buy the medicine they need, and that is now happening far too often in the richest nation in the world. A new report out today from Americans for Tax Fairness explains how a pharmaceutical company, Gilead Sciences, games the system to charge high prices, shift profits offshore and avoid billions in U.S. taxes. Gilead sells a drug called Sovaldi, which is used to treat the hepatitis C virus. The drug was developed with taxpayer funds by a researcher who worked at the Department of Veterans Affairs and founded a small drug company. Gilead bought the company for $11 billion, acquired the government-provided monopoly rights and set the price at $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 per treatment in 2013. U.S. public and private insurers, taxpayers and patients spent more money on Sovaldi in 2014 than on any other prescription drug. Gilead made its investment back in less than a year. If gone untreated, hepatitis C can end in what one nurse-practitioner called \"some of the worst deaths I've ever seen.\" She said, \"At the end, you die not knowing who you are, your belly looks 12 months pregnant, you're malnourished, and you're bleeding to death.\" Patients with hepatitis C are often low-income and a disproportionate number of them are veterans. Yet many Medicaid programs have had to limit access to the drug, and despite spending literally billions of dollars on the new hepatitis C drugs, the Department of Veterans Affairs initially struggled to provide the medication to every veteran who needed it. Meanwhile, Gilead's profits have quintupled since it started selling the drug, from $4 billion in 2013 to $22 billion in 2015. It gets worse. The Americans for Tax Fairness report finds that Gilead has dodged nearly $10 billion in U.S. taxes. How is that possible? Gilead claimed that despite making \"two-thirds of its revenues here and charging higher drug prices than anywhere else in the world, it made only about one-third of its profits in the United States,\" according to the report. The company pays an effective tax rate of just 1 percent in the foreign countries where it claims to do business. And in 2013, Gilead's chief financial officer said the formula for Sovaldi was being transferred to Ireland in order to lower the company's effective tax rate. The strategy worked: Gilead's worldwide effective tax rate dropped from 27 percent in 2013 to 16 percent in 2015. Many American corporations use this practice to avoid paying U.S. taxes, but Gilead's greed is particularly reprehensible because the American public paid for these drugs twice: first taxpayers bankrolled the research behind the hepatitis C drugs and then they paid a second time when Gilead decided to charge Americans the highest price in the world for the treatment. And now Americans are getting cheated a third time as Gilead stashes its profits abroad to avoid taxes. But Gilead is not the only company taking advantage of our public research funding and tax loopholes. Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Meyers Squibb and many others engage in similar offshore tax dodging to avoid billions in U.S. taxes each year. At what point do we say our tax system, our publicly funded research and our patent system are not serving the public interest? At what point do we realize that they have been distorted to serve the private interests of a few billionaires like John C. Martin, Gilead's CEO until this past March, whose compensation peaked at almost $200 million in 2014? At what point will Congress have the courage to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and say enough is enough? Last year I asked the Department of Veterans Affairs to use an existing law allowing the federal government to break patents in order to make hepatitis C drugs available to veterans. I also introduced a bill last year, the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act, which would tax all profits of American corporations the same way regardless of where they are earned. This would eliminate the incentive for companies to hide their profits overseas. I have also supported legislation that would lower costs for consumers by rewarding developers of medicines on the basis of a drug's benefit to consumers. Under such a system, Sovaldi would have been awarded a substantial monetary prize as it represented a major advancement for patients with hepatitis C, but under my proposal, the drug would immediately come on the market as a generic drug, saving consumers a decade or more of paying exorbitant prices for brand-name drugs. I also strongly support instructing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and reducing the barriers to the importation of prescription medication from Canada and other countries. Other countries strictly regulate what pharmaceutical companies can charge, but in the U.S. there is no limit to the egregious profiteering of corporate CEOs. Coupling outrageous prices on drugs with new and inventive ways to avoid paying taxes is truly shameless. That must change. Americans who suffer from hepatitis C today and from many other serious illnesses -- including veterans, retirees, and children -- need a government that works for them, not just the CEOs of large pharmaceutical companies and the billionaire class.", "Phish debuted a new song and made a major announcement on Wednesday. The band will release \"Fuego,\" its first album in five years, on June 24. The record is available for pre-order right now. According to the band's announcement, the bulk of the album was recorded in Nashville last year and was produced by rock legend Bob Ezrin. \"Fuego\" will be Phish's 16th studio album. Last year, as a preview, Trey Anastasio told Rolling Stone that while making the record, the band \"created an atmosphere where it's just the four of us again.\" Drummer Jon Fishman echoed this sentiment in a press release. \"For years, there's been a distinct difference between how we did things live and how we did them in the studio,\" he said. \"But the way we go about things live, the way the musical ball is passed around, is now happening much more in the studio \u2013 not because we're trying to duplicate how we play on stage, just because this is how we operate as a band, period.\" As a teaser, Phish posted the album's eighth track, \"Waiting All Night,\" on YouTube.

Dame Helen Mirren. We already know she\u2019s exceptionally untouchable when it comes to playing powerful roles. She\u2019s played a vixen-esque assassin in Red, an army colonel in Eye in the Sky (a role that was originally created for a man) and the Queen. She may be 70, but don\u2019t think for one send that Dame Helen Mirren is thinking of slowing down. Quite the opposite, actually. The venerable actress \u2013 one of Hollywood\u2019s sexiest if you ask me \u2013 has confirmed she will appear in the latest film in the Fast and Furious franchise, according to CNN. The news comes after Mirren proved she was even more bad ass, saying she\u2019d like a sleeve tattoo and would love to star in the Fast and Furious films. And it looks like the film\u2019s producers heard her. Mirren told Elle magazine: \"I said, \u2018I\u2019ll be in it, but only if I\u2019m allowed to drive if I do drive in it. But we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see how it transpires.\" It\u2019s not her first action film \u2013 if her performance in Red and Red 2 is anything to go by, we\u2019re sure her appearance in Fast and Furious will be nothing short of spectacular. Mirren said last year that she\u2019d want to play the villain in a Fast film. Summit Entertainment She told Yahoo News: My great ambition is to be in a \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019 movie. I so want to be a mad driver in a Fast and Furious movie. My claim to fame is I always do my own driving \u2014 I was on Top Gear, and I did [my lap] in a very good time.

This will definitely be a film worth watching.", "After three winning quarters for the market, what will the fourth bring? If history repeats, stocks could be in for a sweet end to the year. In the last seven years in which the S&P 500 rose in each of the first three quarters, only in one of them \u2014 2007 \u2014 did the index drop in the fourth. Actually, when one looks at the entire performance history of the S&P 500 going back to 1928 (which is available despite the fact that the index was technically created in 1957) one finds that out of the 19 years in which the market rose in the first, second and third quarters, a negative fourth quarter only followed five times. In these 19 years, the S&P's median performance was a 4.1 percent gain, according to a CNBC analysis of FactSet data. That 74 percent \"win rate\" and impressive median gain for fourth quarters following three consecutive winning quarters compares to a 62 percent win rate for the S&P over all of its 355 quarters, and average quarterly performance of a 2.5 percent gain. However, it is also the case that the fourth quarter just happens to be better for investors in general; the market rose in 73 percent of fourth quarters, and actually turned out a better median performance of a 4.5 percent gain. The recent rises seen in fourth quarters can thus be ascribed to market seasonality \u2014 or, perhaps more credibly, to mere randomness. But for the bullish strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who has pointed to similar figures in the past, something more is at work. Lee argues that in years when stocks are doing well, active managers will invest heavily in an attempt to avoid lagging the market too badly \u2014 creating an additional bullish force in the market. The fact that 2016 has been a good year so far is therefore a reason to bet that stocks will rise, he concludes. So will the fourth quarter, which begins on Monday, continue the bullish trend? Unfortunately, marshaling stats all day can obscure but can never alter the fact this question is patently unanswerable.", "HealthCare.gov, the online portal to Obamacare enrollment, will reliably allow consumers to shop and sign up for health coverage by late November, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama said Friday. Nearly a month after the launch of the health insurance exchanges that are central to Obama's health care reform law, the HealthCare.gov website and the information technology behind it continue to pose problems to consumers and health insurance companies alike. On Friday, health care entrepreneur and Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients, who is overseeing a so-called tech surge to repair the site, for the first time offered a concrete timeline for the project. \"By the end of November, HealthCare.gov will work smoothly for the vast majority of users,\" Zients said during a conference call with reporters. \"The bottom line is the performance of the system has been unacceptable,\" Zients said, echoing an assessment Obama offered Monday. \"We're executing a plan of attack and the system is getting better.\" At its worst, HealthCare.gov only allowed three out of 10 users to get all the way through the application for financial assistance, he said. \"The HealthCare.gov site is fixable. It'll take a lot of work and there are a lot of problems that need to be addressed,\" he said. Zients is a former official at the White House Office of Management and Budget and will become director of the White House National Economic Council at the beginning of next year. The administration has described his involvement with Obamacare implementation as short-term. Reaching this newly announced late-November target would give consumers as little as two weeks to choose a health insurance plan that would be in place at the beginning of next year. Because of lag times between selecting coverage and its effective date, the latest an individual or family could make the first payment to their insurer is Dec. 15 if they want benefits in place by Jan. 1. This latest assessment follows months of assurances by Obama and numerous administration officials that HealthCare.gov would be fully operational when it debuted Oct. 1, including statements made just days before the online marketplace launched. The administration expected to enroll 7 million people into health coverage via the more than 30 exchanges being run by the federal government and the more than a dozen operated by states, based on Congressional Budget Office projections. The open enrollment period for 2014 runs until March 31. The health insurance exchanges have processed about 700,000 applications for financial assistance to date, and almost half came through the federal system, which includes HealthCare.gov, a telephone hotline and paper applications, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille. Applications for tax credits to cut health insurance costs aren't the same as actual enrollments, however. Consumers eligible for financial assistance also must choose a private health plan and make a payment to be enrolled. The Obama administration won't release enrollment figures until the middle of next month, though some state-run health insurance exchanges are reporting tens of thousands of enrollments into private health insurance and Medicaid so far. In a major shift, the administration has assigned a private company as the \"general contractor\" overseeing the federal health insurance exchanges and HealthCare.gov, Zients said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had been responsible for coordinating the multiple contractors working on the technology until now, and contractors at a House committee hearing Thursday said it was the agency's decision to postpone full testing of the system until the two weeks before its Oct. 1 launch. A unit of the health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group will take over this coordination, Zients said. Quality Software Services Inc., or QSSI, is a unit of Optum, a UnitedHealth Group company. UnitedHealth Group was not among the health insurance companies represented at a meeting with White House officials Wednesday. QSSI built the data hub used by the federally managed and state-run health insurance exchanges, which serves as the conduit for information transmitted between consumers, multiple government computer systems and health insurance companies. Despite concerns prior to the debut of the exchanges, the data hub has performed well, Zients said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expanding QSSI's existing contract, Bataille said. The administration will not disclose what other companies or individuals are participating in the Obamacare \"tech surge.\" \"There's a clear path forward,\" Zients said. \"There's a 'punch list' of fixes, and we're going to punch them out one by one.\" Issues include problems on the user end, such as navigating through the registration, application and enrollment processes, and on the back end, like health insurance companies receiving corrupted data about their new customers, he said. \"There will be a relentless focus on speed and execution to work through the punch list. Each week the site will get better.\" The administration also is looking into rectifying a quirk with the enrollment deadlines that could subject some people to a portion of the tax penalties for violating the law's individual mandate to have insurance. Currently, consumers would have to select a health plan by Feb. 15 to avoid partial penalties. The administration is working to ensure that anyone who buys health insurance by the end of enrollment on March 31 won't be penalized, Bataille said. The White House announced it was pursuing this policy on Monday.", "You use it in your coffee every morning, or at least you know someone who does. It's a fixture in your daily routine and at diners across the country. We're talking, of course, about half and half. You may see it everywhere, but do you know exactly what half and half is? Allow us to take the embarrassing fall and ask the question so you don't have to: What the f*ck is half and half? We know it's half of something and half of something else, but what are these two, mysterious halves? Of course, the two halves in half and half aren't mysterious at all. Half and half is simply half whole milk and half cream. In the UK, they call it half cream. According The Kitchn, half and half typically has a 10 to 12 percent fat content, which, it stands to reason, means it's less fatty than cream and fattier than milk. You don't need to wait for your morning coffee for this all to make sense. Half and half isn't just for coffee, either. It's great for cooking, whether you want something creamy but not too heavy, or when your recipes call for both milk and cream. The Kitchn suggests you use half and half for ice cream, chocolate ganache, scrambled eggs, or cream sauce. If you add half and half to a deglazed pan, you'll end up with a rich and flavorful sauce for everything from pasta to chicken. Finally, The Kitchen suggests using half and half for White Russians, if drinking a glass full of cream with your vodka doesn't really appeal. You can add it to oatmeal, whip it into mashed potatoes, and even make a cre\u0300me bru\u0302le\u0301e with half and half. The one thing you can't use it for is whipped cream, because the fat content isn't high enough. Outside the U.S., half and half might also refer to something that doesn't have anything to do with milk or cream. In Ireland it might refer to a drink made of Guinness and Harp Lager, and in Brussels it might mean a mixture of Champagne and white wine. Don't worry: the little containers you see everywhere in America, on deli counters and in coffee shops across the nation, contain no alcohol. You'll have to add Bailey's to your coffee for that.", "LONDON \u2014 A UK city council has made one simple change to its forms and one significant leap in the direction of gender inclusivity. The Oxford City Council is adding the gender inclusive option Mx to all its official forms alongside Miss, Ms, Mrs and Mr. The decision, made following a recommendation by the council's executive board, forms part of the council's \"ongoing work to be as inclusive as possible\", according to a council report. \"The council\u2019s workforce has been changing to look more like the diverse communities that it serves. Good policies have helped to bring this about and tackle discrimination but further improvements are possible,\" said Councillor Tom Hayes, the vice-chair of the group's Scrutiny Committee, said in a statement. Hayes also noted that the council is taking steps to build a workplace that's \"friendlier\" to transgender, gender non-conforming and non-binary employees and that gathering personal information is \"central\" to that. Oxford City Council isn't alone in taking steps to make its forms more inclusive. Brighton & Hove City Council sent a letter to thousands of parents in April this year asking them to support the gender their children \"most identify with\" when confirming school places. The letter asked that parents help their children complete a form and to leave the gender section of the form blank if their child is non-binary. UK politicians have also called for gender options to be removed from passports and drivers' licenses in an effort to \"strip back\" talking about gender unless essential. People have taken to Twitter to praise the Oxford City Council for the move. \"Great to see councils doing this,\" wrote one Twitter user.", "It\u2019s unclear how the It\u2019s unclear how the recall will be handled in other regions, but Samsung will start shipping out a care package to all Galaxy Note 7 owners residing in France on Monday, September 19.

The film made an incredible claim: that Hitler killed himself because his doctor cut off his amphetamine supply. This theory sounded crazy \u2014 I had to look into it \u2014 but when I got back to work, I couldn't find the documentary. I wondered whether I had entered some type of twilight zone (cruise ships have pretty strange channels). But my parents saw it too \u2014 we couldn't have all imagined the same thing. At first glance, I thought it was the 2014 BBC documentary \"Hitler's Hidden Drug Habit: Secret History.\" But I watched the whole thing, and the filmmakers made no mention of this wild can't-get-drugs suicide theory. To be clear, though: Yes, Hitler was very, very into drugs. Variousscholarshaveoutlinedhisextensivesubstanceuse. His personal physician, Dr. Theodor Morell, pumped him full of all sorts of treatments, from nerve tonics to Pervitin, a type of amphetamine common in Germany at the time. Morell's personal journals list 74 medications that he gave the fu\u0308hrer, according to the BBC documentary, sometimes administering up to 20 injections a day. The floor of Hitler's bunker where he spent his last days was also said to be littered with medications when researchers entered it years later. There was apparently a rift between Hitler and his doctor in the days before his death. Morell fled the country, and then on April 30, 1945, Hitler killed himself. But would a lack of access to Morell's cache of drugs explain why Hitler did it? There are simpler explanations for Hitler taking his own life \u2014 the fact that he was rapidly losing the war, for one. I tried to find other people who had seen the same documentary I had and came across just one person on Twitter: Theory that Hitler committed suicide due to withdrawal from crystal meth?! Hoo lawdy. pic.twitter.com/13jjGCn7mt \u2014 Kasia K (@PolPrairieMama) May 17, 2016 @HarringtonBecca America's Greatest Monuments? I watched on Smithsonian channel. @smithsonian maybe knows where to watch it? \u2014 Kasia K (@PolPrairieMama) June 2, 2016 But \"America's Greatest Monuments\" didn't pan out. I ultimately contacted a few researchers who were involved in the BBC documentary to see whether they had heard of the suicide theory. Sarah Bailey, a pharmacologist at the University of Bath, expressed strong doubts to Tech Insider: \"It is clear from the documents of the time that Hitler's medicines were numerous and wide ranging. However, it is not clear how much or how frequently these medicines were given. As a pharmacologist, we have to be careful that the dose of any medicine determines whether it may have a medicinal effect rather than a toxic effect. \"It is documented that Hitler took amphetamine (not methamphetamine which is chemically slightly different, more addictive and faster acting). However this did not appear to be routinely in use and we do not know how frequently or how much he was given. Many other medicines appeared to have been given more routinely. \"From the information we had in preparation for making this film, it is too limited to make any conclusions. My personal feeling is that Hitler was not a meth addict but was an experimental subject for many of Dr Morrell's ideas about medicines.\" The clearest condemnation of this crazy theory came from Sir Richard J. Evans, a historian who has extensively studied World War II and the Third Reich. Evans directed me toward an essay he wrote in a recent book of his titled, \"Was Hitler Ill?\" In it, he outlines how considering whether Hitler was insane or sick is a futile endeavor: \"Hitler was not insane or deranged, or suffering from drug-induced delusions,\" he writes, \"or laboring under the effects of some chronic disease such as syphilis, or acting in an unresolved hypnotic trance: on the contrary, he was sane according to any reasonable definition of the term, and fully responsible for his actions.\" In response to the idea that Hitler killed himself because his amphetamine injections were cut off, Evans was unwavering: \"I'm afraid this is complete rubbish,\" he told Tech Insider in an email. But the most convincing argument came from Roland Jones, a colleague of Bailey's at University of Bath. Jones said he agreed with Bailey's assessment and added that if Hitler wanted to get amphetamine, \"he could easily have obtained it elsewhere.\" After all, he was Hitler. So while we'll label this theory debunked for now, questions about that enigmatic documentary remain. Why would someone make a documentary about it? And where did the filmmakers' evidence come from?", "Nazareth - Israel has agreed to allow the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to send a delegation to Israel and the occupied territories. It was Israel has agreed to allow the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to send a delegation to Israel and the occupied territories. It was revealed over the weekend in a step that could dramatically increase the risk of Israeli officials being tried for war crimes. Emmanuel Nahshon, a foreign ministry spokesman, confirmed to Al Jazeera on Sunday that Israel had agreed to the visit in principle, though the \"when and how\" were still under discussion. The ICC's move comes as human rights groups have harshly criticised Israel for closing investigations into dozens of allegations that its military has broken the laws of war during an attack on Gaza in the summer of 2014. The Hague prosecutors are reportedly interested in examining how effective Israel's legal mechanisms are in investigating allegations of war crimes. Under the terms of its founding statute, the ICC could take over jurisdiction of such probes if it is persuaded that Israel is unable or unwilling to conduct credible investigations itself. So far, only three Israeli soldiers have been indicted on a relatively minor charge - of looting - even though Israel's 51-day offensive , named Protective Edge, in July and August 2014 resulted in some 2,250 Palestinian deaths. The vast majority were civilians, including 551 children. \" We have seen Israel conducting flawed investigations or dragging out the legal process with long delays. The main aim appears to be to place obstacles in the way of the investigations so that Israel's armed forces are not held accountable. Nadeem Shehadeh, a lawyer with Adalah The Israeli military exonerated itself late last month in 13 cases it had been investigating. These included lethal attacks on three Palestinian families, the shelling of a hospital and a United Nations shelter for civilians, and the bombing of Gaza's main power plant. It declined to investigate another 80 complaints. In response, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon criticised Israel for the \"low rate of investigations opened into these serious allegations\". Since Protective Edge, two of Israel's largest human rights groups, B'Tselem and Yesh Din, have refused to cooperate with Israeli investigations in Gaza, accusing the Israeli military of using them to \"whitewash\" its actions. In June, the New York-based monitoring group, Human Rights Watch (HRW), added to the pressure on the ICC, calling for it to open a formal investigation into the Gaza offensive. The credibility of Israel's probes has been further undermined by a report issued last week by two local human rights groups. Adalah and Al Mezan, based in Israel and Gaza, respectively. The report accused Israel of failing to examine properly the evidence they had collected relating to 27 suspected war crimes during the 2014 offensive. Five cases referred to the Israeli attacks on UN schools sheltering civilians.Two years on, the groups noted , Israel had issued no indictments. Investigations, where they occurred, were \"clearly flawed\". Nadeem Shehadeh, a lawyer with Adalah, a legal centre for Palestinian citizens in Israel, told Al Jazeera the possibility of legal redress in many cases was close to \"exhausted\". \"We have seen Israel conducting flawed investigations or dragging out the legal process with long delays,\" he said. \"The main aim appears to be to place obstacles in the way of the investigations so that Israel's armed forces are not held accountable.\" Israel's failure to conduct thorough and transparent inquiries could open the door to the ICC launching its own formal investigation, he said. On Friday, an unnamed Israeli official tried to downplay the significance of the visit, telling the Haaretz daily, \"We have nothing to hide.\" The official added that Israel would point out to the ICC that it \"has neither the authority nor the justification to handle the Palestinians' complaints\". Nahshon told Al Jazeera: \" The goal is to give the ICC a better grasp on Israel ' s legal and judicial system. \" However, he continued, \"That will make things easier if we move to another stage,\" - an apparent reference to the possibility that the ICC may consider launching a formal investigation. Ghazi Hamad, a Palestinian official dealing with ICC matters, said the Palestinian Authority hoped that the visit would \" speed up the opening of the investigation \" by the court into Israel's conduct during Protective Edge. \"That would provide a clear message to Israel that it cannot continue to commit crimes with impunity,\" he told Al Jazeera. Hamad said the PA was not told whether the ICC had requested or was granted permission from Israel to access Gaza This is the first time Israel has agreed to cooperate with an international body over allegations that could ultimately lead to war crimes trials. Israel denied entry to UN commissions of inquiry in 2009 and 2014, following major offensives in Gaza. Officials in Washington have repeatedly voiced their opposition to the ICC exercising jurisdiction over Israeli nationals. Neither the US nor Israel has ratified the Rome Statute, the document establishing The Hague court in 2002. Sari Bashi, director of the Israel-Palestine branch of HRW, said israel's continuing restrictions on human rights organisations entering Gaza had further undermined the credibility of Israel's investigations. The strict controls had made it \"more difficult for [the groups] to do their jobs and to bring relevant information to light\", she told Al Jazeera. Israeli authorities, she added, had previously conceded that human rights groups played an important role in helping to \"overcome the fear that Palestinian residents have of meeting [Israeli military] personnel.\" Al Mezan and Adalah said that, in many cases, Israel had refused to speak to any witnesses outside the military before it dropped inquiries into suspected war crimes. Israel has received a total of 500 complaints relating to 360 incidents in Gaza in which there are suspicions of violations of international law. So far, only a handful of investigations have been opened, relating mainly to physical assaults on civilians, \"unlawful firing\" at buildings, and looting. On August 24, Israeli announced the closure of more than 93 cases. In 80 cases, no formal investigation was conducted. Two years on, Israel is still undecided whether to scrutinise some of the most contentious phases of its offensive, including the massive bombardment of Rafah to prevent an Israeli soldier from being taken as prisoner. The incident, known as Black Friday, is believed to have killed more than 100 Palestinian residents of the area. Aida Burnett-Cargill, a spokeswoman in Gaza for Al Mezan, said Palestinian human rights organisations had sent to the ICC Palestinian witness statements relating to Black Friday in March. \" We hope these materials and others are raising doubts in the minds of the ICC's prosecutors about the seriousness with which Israel is handling its investigations,\" she told Al Jazeera. Hamad said that the Palestinian foreign minister, Riad al-Malki, had met the ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, in The Hague on Friday to promise any help the court might need to launch a formal investigation. The ICC is currently conducting a \"preliminary inquiry\" to examine whether an investigation is warranted into suspected violations of international law, either by Israel or Palestinian factions. Protective Edge is the first major offensive against the Palestinians over which The Hague court has potential jurisdiction. In ratifying the Rome Statute last year, the Palestinians gave the ICC authority from June 2014, a month before Israel's attack on Gaza. Among the investigations Israel closed last month was one looking into the shelling of a UN school in Rafah that was serving as a temporary shelter for 3,000 Palestinians. Some 12 civilians, including eight children, were killed and at least 25 injured. Chris Gunness, a UN spokesman in Jerusalem, told Al Jazeera that Israel had been given the school's coordinates and was warned on 33 separate occasions of its role as a shelter, the last time being an hour before the attack. Human rights groups have challenged Israel's claims that the school was hit because militants riding a motorbike changed course towards the school after a missile had been fired at them. Al Mezan's testimonies suggest that the riders were civilians and should not have been targeted. HRW, meanwhile, discovered that the type of munition Israel used could have been diverted when it was clear it would explode near the school. Adalah and Al Mezan said Israeli authorities had refused to divulge the basis for most of their decisions either to exonerate soldiers or refuse the opening of investigations, claiming the evidence was classified. Human rights groups have criticised the closing of other investigations. In June, inquiries were dropped against Neria Yeshurun, a brigade commander who had admitted to ordering the shelling of a medical clinic \"to raise morale\", apparently in revenge after one of his officers was killed. He was reprimanded instead. In another controversial case, Israel closed an investigation in June 2015 into the killing of four boys as they played football on a beach, close to hotels where foreign reporters were based. Shehadeh said Adalah, which supplied testimonies to Israel about the boys' deaths, had immediately appealed the decision to Israel's attorney general but had heard nothing for more than a year. In May, leading Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said it would no longer submit complaints to the Israeli authorities. It said it was pointless to work \"with a system whose real function is measured by its ability to continue to successfully cover up\".", "Hunger makes us do crazy things. Case in point: A ravenous bear broke into a Lyons, Colorado, bakery and ate 24 pies, as well as several bags of ingredients. The mischievous bear entered the Colorado Cherry Company by breaking through a window and climbing onto the oven, where he proceeded to eat two dozen pies as well as \"bags of cocoa and a bag of sugar,\" the owner's daughter Mikaela Lehnert told The Guardian . While it sounds as if the bear was indiscriminate in his tastes, he actually had quite the discerning palate. \"He went for the apple and the cherry and left behind the strawberry rhubarb, so he was a picky little guy,\" Lehnert said. The morning after the pie raid, Lehnert and her mother arrived to find their store in shambles, with two boxes in the yard. And, with 24 pies devoured without a trace, they have reason to believe that the bear enjoyed his dining experience \u2013 and may return. \"We have a feeling he knows it's here so he's going to come back,\" Lehnert said. Despite the damage (a broken window and vanished food supplies), the publicity from the strange break-in has been much appreciated. \"If anything it's boosted [our business] because it put our pies and product out there.\" This article originally appeared on People.com", "Sometimes, it's not just the drink that's bitter IS a G&T your favourite tipple? This could mean that you\u2019re more likely to have psychopathic tendencies. Research reveals that people who are drawn to bitter-tasting drinks are more likely to be narcissistic and sadistic. Could your favourite boozy treat say something about your personality? The study was led by Professor Christina Sagioglou from Innsbruck University in Austria and involved almost 1,000 test subjects. Findings suggested that people who opted for stronger, sharper flavours were more likely to experience a \"thrill\" when they felt discomfort. The strong flavour of gin could give drinkers a rush of adrenaline Professor Sagioglou explained that the sensation can be \"compared to a rollercoaster ride, where people enjoy things that induce fear\". First, the participants were asked to rank a list of sweet, salty and sour foods on a six point scale ranging from \u2018dislike strongly\u2019 to \u2018like strongly\u2019. After registering their taste preferences, subjects were given four different personality tests that measured aggression, selfishness, psychopathy and narcissism. During the testing, participants were asked to give assessments on statements such as: \"Given enough provocation, I may hit someone\" and \"I enjoy tormenting people\". They were also questioned about extroversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and emotional stability. Coffee drinkers may also tend towards exhibiting these personality trends Trends in the results showed that bitter taste preferences were strongly associated with psychopathic tendencies. This means that those who were drawn to drinks, such as a refreshing gin and tonic or an invigorating cup of coffee, were more likely to be narcissistic. In contrast, those who registered an aversion to bitter foods were linked to more agreeable personality traits, such as being kind, sympathetic and cooperative.", "Everybody wants what feels good. Everyone wants to live a carefree, happy and easy life, to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the Red Sea when you walk into the room. Everyone would like that\u2014it\u2019s easy to like that. If I ask you, \"What do you want out of life?\" and you say something like, \"I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like,\" it\u2019s so ubiquitous that it doesn\u2019t even mean anything. A more interesting question, a question that perhaps you\u2019ve never considered before, is what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for? Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out. Everybody wants to have an amazing job and financial independence\u2014but not everyone wants to suffer through 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchies and the blase\u0301 confines of an infinite cubicle hell. People want to be rich without the risk, without the sacrifice, without the delayed gratification necessary to accumulate wealth. Everybody wants to have great sex and an awesome relationship\u2014but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings and the emotional psychodrama to get there. And so they settle. They settle and wonder \"What if?\" for years and years and until the question morphs from \"What if?\" into \"Was that it?\" And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say, \"What was that for?\" if not for their lowered standards and expectations 20 years prior, then what for? Because happiness requires struggle. The positive is the side effect of handling the negative. You can only avoid negative experiences for so long before they come roaring back to life. At the core of all human behavior, our needs are more or less similar. Positive experience is easy to handle. It\u2019s negative experience that we all, by definition, struggle with. Therefore, what we get out of life is not determined by the good feelings we desire but by what bad feelings we\u2019re willing and able to sustain to get us to those good feelings. People want an amazing physique. But you don\u2019t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that comes with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate-sized portions. People want to start their own business or become financially independent. But you don\u2019t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, and working insane hours on something you have no idea whether will be successful or not. People want a partner, a spouse. But you don\u2019t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. It\u2019s part of the game of love. You can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t play. What determines your success isn\u2019t \"What do you want to enjoy?\" The question is, \"What pain do you want to sustain?\" The quality of your life is not determined by the quality of your positive experiences but the quality of your negative experiences. And to get good at dealing with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life. There\u2019s a lot of crappy advice out there that says, \"You\u2019ve just got to want it enough!\" Everybody wants something. And everybody wants something enough. They just aren\u2019t aware of what it is they want, or rather, what they want \"enough.\" Because if you want the benefits of something in life, you have to also want the costs. If you want the beach body, you have to want the sweat, the soreness, the early mornings, and the hunger pangs. If you want the yacht, you have to also want the late nights, the risky business moves, and the possibility of pissing off a person or ten thousand. If you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy, an idealization, an image and a false promise. Maybe what you want isn\u2019t what you want, you just enjoy wanting. Maybe you don\u2019t actually want it at all. Sometimes I ask people, \"How do you choose to suffer?\" These people tilt their heads and look at me like I have twelve noses. But I ask because that tells me far more about you than your desires and fantasies. Because you have to choose something. You can\u2019t have a pain-free life. It can\u2019t all be roses and unicorns. And ultimately that\u2019s the hard question that matters. Pleasure is an easy question. And pretty much all of us have similar answers. The more interesting question is the pain. What is the pain that you want to sustain? That answer will actually get you somewhere. It\u2019s the question that can change your life. It\u2019s what makes me me and you you. It\u2019s what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together. For most of my adolescence and young adulthood, I fantasized about being a musician \u2014 a rock star, in particular. Any badass guitar song I heard, I would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling. This fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. The fantasizing continued up through college, even after I dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously. But even then it was never a question of if I\u2019d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when. I was biding my time before I could invest the proper amount of time and effort into getting out there and making it work. First, I needed to finish school. Then, I needed to make money. Then, I needed to find the time. Then ... and then nothing. Despite fantasizing about this for over half of my life, the reality never came. And it took me a long time and a lot of negative experiences to finally figure out why: I didn\u2019t actually want it. I was in love with the result\u2014the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what I\u2019m playing\u2014but I wasn\u2019t in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. Repeatedly. Hell, I didn\u2019t even try hard enough to fail at it. I hardly tried at all. The daily drudgery of practicing, the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing, the pain of finding gigs and actually getting people to show up and give a shit. The broken strings, the blown tube amp, hauling 40 pounds of gear to and from rehearsals with no car. It\u2019s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn\u2019t like to climb much. I just liked to imagine the top. Our culture would tell me that I\u2019ve somehow failed myself, that I\u2019m a quitter or a loser. Self-help would say that I either wasn\u2019t courageous enough, determined enough or I didn\u2019t believe in myself enough. The entrepreneurial/start-up crowd would tell me that I chickened out on my dream and gave in to my conventional social conditioning. I\u2019d be told to do affirmations or join a mastermind group or manifest or something. But the truth is far less interesting than that: I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn\u2019t. End of story. I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love not with the fight but only the victory. And life doesn\u2019t work that way. Who you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who move up it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainty of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it. This is not a call for willpower or \"grit.\" This is not another admonishment of \"no pain, no gain.\" This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. So choose your struggles wisely, my friend. This post originally appeared on MarkManson.net. Follow @iammarkmanson on Twitter.", "Even before he took an NFL snap, there were many who believed that Tim Tebow might be better suited as a fullback or H-back-type player if he wanted to have a career in the league. Once Tebow was drafted and he struggled as a signal-caller \u2013 he couldn\u2019t make decisions quick enough and he was inaccurate \u2013 the calls for him to switch positions, or maybe try his hand in the Canadian Football League, only grew louder. But Tebow refused. It was quarterback or nothing. So nothing it is; Tebow spent training camp with the New England Patriots in 2013 and the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015, but the 2010 first-round pick hasn\u2019t played a meaningful snap in the league since 2012. So now Tebow has turned his attention to baseball. He hasn\u2019t played the game since his junior year of high school over a decade ago, but he\u2019s been working out on the diamond, and feels he\u2019s ready to try out for teams. On Tuesday, multiple reporters tweeted that Tebow will hold a showcase in Los Angeles on Aug. 30, and there\u2019s enough curiosity in what the now-29-year-old Tebow can do that more than 20 Major League Baseball teams are confirmed to be sending personnel to watch the workout. Tebow is of course willing to pursue whatever he\u2019d like, and if he can find folks willing to indulge him, all the better. But as noted by The MMQB\u2019s Albert Breer, it\u2019s curious that after refusing to consider other positions and options with the sport (we assume) is his first love, Tebow is now willing to grind it out in baseball. If he\u2019s signed, Tebow isn\u2019t just going to jump onto a Major League roster; he\u2019ll be in the minors, the antithesis of glamour. In the NFL, games are played in front of 65,000 fans, teams travel to road games on chartered planes and have police escort their buses from hotel to stadium. That\u2019s not life in the minors. Tebow is from Florida and played in the SEC with the Florida Gators, so let\u2019s say the Tampa Bay Rays sign him. Their advanced Single-A team is the Charlotte Stone Crabs in Port Charlotte, Fla., in the Florida State League. That means traveling all over his home state, to cities like Bradenton and Dunedin, and the biggest stadium is 11,000 seats for the Tampa Yankees. Assume the Rays place Tebow with their Double-A team, the Montgomery (Ala.) Biscuits. The Biscuits are in the Southern League. You know the other teams in the Southern League? The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Lookouts, the Biloxi (Miss.) Shuckers and the Pensacola (Fla.) Blue Wahoos, among other teams. Again, biggest stadium is 11,000 seats. And the bus rides are a lot longer. Keep in mind, too, those leagues wrap up their respective regular seasons by Sept. 5, though maybe he will play in the Arizona Fall league. For the teams interested in Tebow, signing him is worth it if you believe that he\u2019ll help boost attendance. That makes business sense. Maybe Tebow is prepared for the reality of life as a minor leaguer. It seems odd that he wouldn\u2019t change positions in football but now he\u2019s all in on a baseball career that will almost certainly start in some small city, in front of small crowds, with a paltry per diem as he spends hours and hours on a bus between series.", "November 18 The Grand Tour: Launch Date", "Let's talk booties with Coco! As the new mom continues to soak up every moment with her baby girl, she's also finding time to share some very important questions with her Twitter followers. Ladies and gentlemen, we can't help but ask: What do you call your booty? \"Funny question,\" she began in a new post Saturday afternoon. \"Girls, do u have a nickname for your booty? My sister named mine her crystal ball. She said she could see her future...lol.\"", "Time for your weekly edition of the Deadspin Funbag. Got something on your mind? Email the Funbag. Today, we\u2019re covering egg whites, sex, cats that do dishes, and more. I took my family on a short road trip for spring break, and on the way home, my 2-year-old asked me to pull over so he could go take a crap. So I did. I pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing. He did NOT have to take a shit. So he got back in the car, and we drove for another 30 minutes, and then he announced, for a second time, that he had to go poop. \"You\u2019re not lying this time, are you?\" I asked him. \"If you\u2019re lying, I\u2019ll never stop for you to poop again.\" But he said he had really had to go, so I pull over, and it\u2019s the same thing. He was either lying or he got stage fright in the McDonald\u2019s can. So my wife puts him back in the car, and we get stuck in traffic on the Beltway just as we\u2019re getting home. I think you know where this is going. Once again, the boy screamed out that he had to poop. I told him he could hold it until we got home. Then he started clutching at his tummy and crying out to pull over. \"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying this time,\" my wife said. But I swear to you, we were just a mile from home at that point. And the Beltway is one of those horrible roads that offers very little in the way of ideal places to pull over. Home was the only logical destination for him to go void his bowels. So I told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer. Begged him, really. Sponsored On the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying. And I knew why. I could hear him exhaling forcefully. Kids don\u2019t hide that sort of thing. We pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom. Green shit was CAKED on his legs. It was everywhere. Some of it fell out of his pants (how?) and landed on the front stoop. It was terrifying. Anyway, that\u2019s parenting in a nutshell for you. You take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place. Now, your letters: Dan: I don\u2019t know if this is a good question, because I doubt there\u2019s any kind of satisfying answer to it. But why do no NFL teams seem to care that Jameis Winston maybe raped a girl? The mock drafts all have him going at no. 1 or 2 (most say no. 1). How the fuck?! Especially in light of the year the NFL has just had (and Goodell\u2019s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that NFL teams won\u2019t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? Even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he\u2019s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the \"fuck her right in the pussy\" thing. How are Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? I\u2019m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about Johnny Manziel\u2019s partying and how that would affect his draft stock. HOW DOES RAPE NOT??? Why aren\u2019t they even mentioning it? I think you\u2019re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don\u2019t care. Of course they care. You\u2019d care if you were the GM who decided to risk his job by investing the no. 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist. But the Bucs desperately need a QB (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they\u2019re probably best off drafting Winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to Peter King about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about Winston in studying him for the draft. That strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft Winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, \"Don\u2019t blame us! We talked to 75 whole people about him!\" They just want to make sure he doesn\u2019t commit any FUTURE rapes. And if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame Winston and Winston alone for it. But it is strange that, in the public scouting process, Winston\u2019s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like \"immaturity\" and shit like that. Look at Lovie Smith gush about Winston, even though he can\u2019t possibly know him all that well: \"To me, I think he\u2019s told us an awful lot with how he\u2019s handled it,\" Smith said. \"It\u2019s not like he\u2019s getting ready to go into the NFL and scrutiny is coming his way. He\u2019s gone through it a couple years now, and he\u2019s answered the bell. That\u2019s what you have to do. You have to have tunnel vision and do your job. Looking from the outside, that\u2019s what he\u2019s been able to do.\" I mean, that\u2019s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive. LOOK AT HIM SHAKE OFF DEFENDERS AND CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES WITH SUCH EASE! The fact that Winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the NFL and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word RAPE not be thrown around when addressing Winston, is all Smith needs to sell you on the IDEA of drafting him ... to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the Bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking Earth. That\u2019s why Winston\u2019s rape allegations haven\u2019t necessarily affected his draft stock the way Johnny Manziel\u2019s drinking did. It\u2019s because NFL teams think that Winston is simply a better player. If neither player had baggage going into the draft, Winston would be taken before Manziel every time. That\u2019s the reason the Browns are ready to give up on Manziel already. It\u2019s not the boozing. It\u2019s the fact that they don\u2019t think the little fucker can play. The NFL can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the NFL would rather not acknowledge as still existing. They constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead. If Jameis is gonna go no. 1 no matter what, the NFL has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn\u2019t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft. You know what\u2019s funny about all this? Winston was AWFUL last season, and I\u2019m not talking about just his \"Yakety Sax\" play in the Rose Bowl. He threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit ACC teams. But scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that Winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes. If you look the part, and you\u2019ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football IQ and magical QB unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers. And the rape stuff. It\u2019s quite something. (By the way, SUPERFUCK Jaws and Mike Mayock for their little \"Mariota\u2019s on top of my board now!\" spiel this week. Jaws is an empty-headed attention whore who will say basically anything. And the only reason certain football fans enjoy Mayock is because they haven\u2019t learned to be sick of him yet.) Kyle: Are BIG EGG and BIG NUTRITION teaming up to push the egg white agenda? You have to have roughly double the egg whites to get the same amount of food, thus causing an increase in egg consumption. I\u2019m suspicious of the whole thing. But the yolk has all the cholesterol! If you simply throw out the yolk, and then add bacon, ham, and cheese to your omelet, it can\u2019t hurt you at all! That\u2019s science. I used to be huge on egg whites. True story: In college, I would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way. I thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole \"eating a whole bagel\" part of the enterprise. Sometimes I ate two in one sitting. Do not do this. The truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so that you can eat more food. I hate small portions, so if I eat a 12-pound egg-white omelet, I feel like I just got away with something. But in general, this is untrue. You need portion control in your life, which means you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway. The yolk is the best part. All golden and runny and seeping into the toast nooks ... I could a 50-egg omelet. I swear. There are never enough eggs in the omelet for me. Why are eggs so small? I need eggs to be triple their current size. I don\u2019t like cracking so many of them. I am not a crackpot. Danny: If tomorrow, you could appoint any current non-politician in America as the POTUS for the next eight years, who do you think would do the best job? Give me your top 3, and provide reasons why. It has to be a public figure\u2014don\u2019t get all sappy and say your dad, or your awesome 2nd-grade teacher. Also, assume that anyone who you appointed would drop whatever else it was they were doing and accept their next eight years living in the White House. Well, look, it\u2019s not like politicians are somehow uniquely skilled anyway. Pretty much anyone can be a politician if some shadowy party operative hands them a bag of cash and is like, \"Bill Kristol says you have nice teeth.\" That\u2019s truly all you need to become a prominent politician in America at the present moment. They should probably make you take a test or something. That said, if I had to vote for one random famous person to be dropped into the Oval Office for the next eight years, I\u2019m picking Elon Musk. I need a VISIONARY, man. I want Musk to divert all defense spending into building a giant water slide from New York to L.A. Every other issue facing the country would be solved if such a water slide existed. Don\u2019t tell me it can\u2019t be done. I won\u2019t hear it. I know it\u2019s lame to pick a captain of industry for that job, but I don\u2019t want a fucking actor. I don\u2019t want some comedian like Jon Stewart or Louis CK who would hate the job instantly. A good president needs to believe his own horseshit, and Musk and/or Tim Cook would more than fulfill that requirement. Third choice would be Belichick, because he\u2019d fire everyone and then fuck every Congressman\u2019s wife. And he\u2019d have SO many secrets. Finally, America would have a Putin of its own. SUCK IT, RUSSIA. Brian: Me and my girlfriend have debated this for a while, and we are both dead set in believing the other is 100 percent wrong: What\u2019s the better time of year for sex, summer or winter? She says that summer is better because the heat makes it feel that much more steamy, summer bodies are great, and you can get fully nude without having to keep any layers on because of the cold. I say fuck that. September is the most common birth month in the United States, which means that we Americans seem to prefer fucking in the winter, if only because there\u2019s nothing else to do. Personally, I prefer summer. I don\u2019t want to worry about having to cover up all the sexy business with a comforter because everyone in the bed is colder than shit in January. I want everything out in the open. I want to be hot and sweaty and horny and dying to rip off my sexy striped polo shirt just for YOU, baby. I want the covers off and the lights on and I want to see EVERYTHING. I need good material for when I\u2019m alone. Summer is sexier. TELL THEM, Y&T! HALFTIME! William: Would you rather have a dog that folds laundry, or a cat that does dishes? The dog, I guess. My preference for dogs over cats is greater than my hatred for doing dishes over folding laundry, so there you have it. Doing dishes blows, but folding laundry is also horrible. It\u2019s 8:30 p.m., and the kids are finally asleep ,and I\u2019m just about ready to settle into the recliner when I see that fucking laundry basket filled to the brim over in the corner, and it never ceases to make my blood boil. Fuck that laundry. I should only have to fold MY clothes. My clothes are big and sparse and easy to fold. My laundry is awesome. My wife should thank me for never wearing more than one pair of pants in a week. Corey: Let\u2019s say all members of the Beatles and N.W.A are magically revived and/or returned to their artistic primes. The Beatles then have to go into the studio and record an album of N.W.A\u2019s best hits, and vice versa. Which album ends up sounding better? The Beatles one, because the Beatles would just take the NWA lyrics and arrange some entirely new Beatles song around them, and it would probably be very pretty. As much as I like NWA, I don\u2019t wanna hear them butcher \"Blackbird.\" None of those guys could sing. When Diddy ripped off \"Every Breath You Take\" just so he could milk Biggie\u2019s death one more time, I wanted him to fall into a canyon. Also, I bet John Lennon would REALLY relish pretending to be an inner-city black man. He\u2019d be way too enthusiastic about it. Blake: How many albums a year could the top pop stars put out? Beyonce\u0301 could have the top 20 songwriters writing at all times, and the top producers and editors working year-round like Christmas elves. The masses never tire of pop music, so why not put out an album a month? Because that\u2019s too much product! Even the nuttiest white-girl Beyonce\u0301 fans would get sick of her if she put out 120 songs a year. You can\u2019t keep up with that kind of catalog. Those songs can\u2019t all be great. Even if they were, you\u2019d still grade them on a curve and have certain \"hits\" in your mind that would make your permanent rotation, with everything else falling by the wayside. That\u2019s easy to do now. Back in day, when I had to listen to tapes, I usually listened to all the songs on the album because I was too lazy to fast forward. I heard \"Back Off Bitch\" by GNR far more times than anyone should have to endure. Not their best work. I don\u2019t have to do that anymore. Technology has made me a supremely lazy music fan. It\u2019s just not possible to absorb that much music from one artist, no matter how hard you try. Ever have your favorite artist put out a double album? It\u2019s a complete pain in the ass. I need you to go away for a while so that I can grow to love you again. Whenever an artist says that they had 60 tracks to choose from or whatever for a single album, I can promise you that you NEVER want to hear the 50 tracks they threw away. Half of those tracks are just the guy freestyling on the bongos while high on acid. Kevin: So I\u2019m getting married in a month, and my fiance\u0301 and I are closing on a house next week. Instead of some over-the-top bachelor party, I am asking that my friends just help me move. My friends feel that this is selfish, and I\u2019m taking advantage of them. We\u2019re moving from a 1,000-square-foot apartment into a three-bedroom house. It\u2019s not like we have a ton of stuff. The plan was that I rent the truck, and we move everything Saturday morning, and then grill steaks and get drunk Saturday night in the new house. I think that this is way better than asking everyone to kick in hundreds of dollars to go golfing for a weekend or whatever; it\u2019s my bachelor party, and I should be able to do what I want, right? But that\u2019s not a party. You\u2019re asking for free manual labor instead. That doesn\u2019t count as a celebration, you monster. If I threw a party, and everyone came, and then I was like, \"Hey guys, this is a LAUNDRY FOLDING party! Now fold my laundry and I\u2019ll get takeout!\" all my friends would have me killed. You can\u2019t do that. If you want to ask your friends to help you move, that\u2019s fine. But you can\u2019t apply that to your party credit. Do the move yourself, and then have the bachelor-party cookout afterward, without putting any work obligations on your friends. Steve: This actually happened close to six years ago, but it remains a contentious issue amongst our group of friends. Five of us were on a road trip from Montreal to Boston, rotating drivers evenly as one does on longish road trips. As we got close to Boston, the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding. Since we were in college at the time, the $200+ ticket was nothing to sneeze at. (Who are we kidding? It\u2019s still a lot of damn money.) The issue was \u2014 does the ticket get split amongst the group, or paid solely by the driver? The four of us who drove first say no, since we drove our portion without incident. The friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg was the toughest, and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time, and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and whites started flashing, that we should split the ticket. Who is right? The last leg was the toughest? Why? Were there dragons lining the highway? Your friend was driving, and thus he\u2019s responsible for his own driving behavior, even if he had shit luck. He pays the ticket. If another friend riding in the car wants to pitch in, fine. But that guy shouldn\u2019t EXPECT it. These kids today never want to take responsibility SMDH! I went to a basketball game last week, and I had an Uber take me home, only the Uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he was waiting for me. And I felt bad that he got the ticket, so when the ride ended, I gave him $20 in cash extra. And that, of course, made me feel all generous and kind. YES AMERICA, I helped pay a full one-tenth of that poor bastard\u2019s ticket while exploiting regulation loopholes that force working-class people to act as private chauffeurs to uppity white dipshits with smartphones. MEDAL OF HONOR FOR ME, PLEEEEEEEZ. But screw your friend. Tom: Where would the most opportune time/place for aliens to land to get the biggest initial audience, but not get shot out of the sky? The White House lawn would be a great spot, but they would have several fighter jets shooting at them before they land; a random field would have no one around. I feel the best bet is a major sporting event that doesn\u2019t have dedicated aerial security. What do you think? All major sporting events have (in theory) patrolled airspace. I would just vote for the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, dead center of Manhattan. News crews could get there quickly. Crowds would form. Roasted-nut vendors would make a KILLING. And New Yorkers would instantly try to take ownership of the First Contact experience. \"You guys don\u2019t get these aliens. IT\u2019S A NEW YORK THING.\" Actually, now that I think about it, let\u2019s choose any large park space in any other city. Because Central Park is a complete fucking pain in the ass. It\u2019s hot and overcrowded, and there\u2019s horseshit everywhere. If aliens landed there, four million people would converge on the spot, and then I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a good view, and the subways would be jammed, and I would just say FUCK IT and then go home and watch the aliens on TV instead. Mike: How does Robocop poop? He has that weird baby food he has to eat to keep his organic parts alive, so he must have to release it somehow. Actually, if you look at the original uniform design, the posterior covering is soft and potentially removable. It\u2019s not welded metal. Robocop could, in theory, remove a posterior assflap to do his business, even if no standard toilet could possibly bear the weight of a three-ton cyborg sitting down to shit in it. My guess is that instead of straight defecation, Robocop has an internal waste-management system that processes his urine and stool, and then either a) recycles it for some other practical use (poop gun), or b) can be discreetly disposed of, like through a leg dispenser. That\u2019s what I would do if I were designing the perfect 21st-century scumbag-killing machine. RoboCop has no time for poop. Aaron: What happened if it came out that President Obama had a Twitter account under a different name and was trolling conservatives and his critics completely anonymously? I\u2019m not saying one of his staffers was doing this\u2014this was how Barry O passed the time while on the shitter. Would there be calls for impeachment/resignation? How long would the media blow that up for? What would his Twitter handle be? Would he put a picture and bio, or just keep the egg there like a weirdo? There are calls for Obama\u2019s impeachment and resignation on a daily basis right now, so I assume a @Luther account would only amplify those daily complaints. \"More like Marco Boob-io, AMIRITE?!\" That tweet would probably help fill up a news cycle or two before everyone stopped giving a shit. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d actually resign, though. After all, plenty of politicians out there already use Twitter for trolling purposes. And we live in age where you can survive pretty much any scandal so long as you\u2019re willing to sit there and ride it out. You let 200 million people take a dump on your face for a week, nod politely, and then everything is back to normal. I do think he\u2019d have a picture and bio for his troll account, tho. The Obama machine knows too much about the internet to let that slide. Email of the week! Ape Chemist: Suppose during the first round of the NFL draft, the camera cuts to a player talking on his cell phone and smiling and celebrating with his family and friends. This all takes place while the team is on the clock, so Goodell has yet to announce the pick. While celebrating, the player\u2014like Lamarr Houston or Bill Gramatica\u2014tears his ACL. Assume the team hasn\u2019t officially announced the pick. Does the NFL let the team withdraw the pick? I remember when the Vikings had to pass on a pick because they didn\u2019t get their card in on time, so I could absolutely see some team arguing the pick wasn\u2019t official until the card is turned in and read. I hope this happens to some team like the Cowboys, and Jerry sends someone onstage to tackle Goodell before he reaches the podium. I might be wrong, but I think once you turn the card in, the pick is final. No backsies, even if it hasn\u2019t been formally announced. If you haven\u2019t turned the card in but GLORY BOY decided to tear his knee up anyway, then fuck him. Switch it and draft Todd Gurley instead. But once the Ginger Hammer has that card, you cannot bend his IRON WILL. Drew Magary writes for Deadspin. He\u2019s also a correspondent for GQ.

Apparently he\u2019s constantly seen at celebrity parties \u2013 that\u2019s definitely a step up from Target!", "Many years ago, I found myself standing in my boyfriend\u2019s home, listening patiently as he argued with his ex on the phone. It was one of those petty discussions about absolutely nothing, a mere excuse for connection between two individuals struggling to let go of each other. At the time, I was the New Girlfriend, and his ex had recently learned about me. Needless to say, she wasn\u2019t happy about the news of him moving on. She was screaming loud enough that I could hear her across the room. \"Does that woman have any idea what a horrible person you are?\" she asked. At that point, he opted to involve me in the conversation. \"Tara?\" He he turned to me. \"Do you know how horrible I am?\" I smiled and gave him a sarcastic, \"yeah.\" At that point, his ex decided to speak to me. Once we were connected, her angry tone dissipated as she embraced a more big-sister kind of role. \"When I met him, I never thought he would ever hurt me,\" she confessed. At the time, I thought she was crazy and tried to contain my laughter. \"Well then,\" I told her. \"I guess you must\u2019ve done something to deserve it.\" To this day, I have no idea what her intentions were. Did she honestly want to warn me about the dangers of getting involved with the man who had caused her so much pain? Or was she just trying to scare me away in hopes that they might reconcile? It doesn\u2019t matter. The point of my story is this: Don\u2019t bother trying to warn a new woman about your ex. You might have the best of intentions. Perhaps you really do want to save her the trouble and heartache that you\u2019ve come to know so well. However, chances are your advice will fall on deaf ears. Here\u2019s why: She doesn\u2019t want to hear it. Their relationship is new and exciting. When they\u2019re together, she feels exhilarated and happier than she\u2019s ever been in her life. Your ex is currently fulfilling the role of Man Of Her Dreams, and she can\u2019t imagine him as anything else. Your well-intentioned warning of his dark side would come as an unwelcome buzz kill. If she were to hear you at all, she\u2019d likely reject your advice because it conflicts with everything her heart tells her. She won\u2019t give you any credit. In their love story, she\u2019s Cinderella and he\u2019s Prince Charming. Who are you? You\u2019re the bitter ex and unfortunately, your experience doesn\u2019t count for much in her mind. He probably told her that you were a terrible partner and he suffered miserably for most of the time you were together. It\u2019s realistic to assume that she thinks you\u2019re jealous of her age, beauty and happiness. Why on Earth should she listen to you? She needs to make (and learn from) her own mistakes. Remember when you thought your parents were old fuddy-duddies who knew nothing? They probably warned you about a lot of things, yet you had to find out for yourself. Didn\u2019t you? She does too. You might be wrong. What if the New Woman is truly better suited to build a life with your ex? The possibility exists that she\u2019s a more compatible partner than you were. As time goes by, she might bring out the best in him, and that will likely make things better for you. The cold hard truth is this: Once you and your ex have separated, his relationships are none of your business. As a mother, you have every right to be concerned about your children\u2019s comfort and safety with the new woman. But as an (angry, wounded, bitter, smarter) ex, you have no right to counsel another adult about her choice in romantic partners. The good news is, while you\u2019re not busy worrying about your ex\u2019s new flame, you have more time to think about yourself. Keep learning from your own experiences, and you can look forward to greater happiness in your own life.", "There\u2019s something about seeing a little newborn preciously posed with clothing, keepsakes, or other familial props that really makes their announcement into the world a celebration. When photographer Kim Stone shot the recently born Aubrey in a series of darling setups, she posed her in soft pink sheets and beautiful blue headwear, like these photogenic triplets. But the most powerful photo in the series is one of little Aubrey wrapped in motorcycle gloves, next to a colorful, shiny motorcycle helmet. The hands gently curl around the child while she grins peacefully, safe under the guise of big, strong arms. This image is particularly touching because it is representative of her father, whose life was tragically cut short several weeks before her birth. Though her life began with a bit of strife, Aubrey\u2019s sweet smile emulates hope for her family.", "Britney Spears and Kevin Federline reunited over the weekend at their son's soccer game. Spears and Federline cheered on little Jayden at a field in Woodland Hills, Calif., on Saturday (Oct. 26), according to the photo agency that secured the snapshots. The 31-year-old songstress looked casual in a red turtleneck, skinny jeans, oversized sunglasses, and her hair pulled back in a messy bun. A bodyguard stood by her side, while her ex was joined by his daughter, Kori. The couple, who married in 2004 and split in 2006, appeared to be on friendly terms, notes E! News. They stood next to each other, watching the game from the sidelines. Earlier this month, the two made headlines when TMZ caught up with Federline and asked if he would be OK with their elder son, Sean Preston, joining Spears on stage during her Las Vegas residency. Federline said he would only be excited to see his son up there if he were 25 years old. Spears' rep later told TMZ she was \"joking\" about the possibility of the boy accompanying her on stage.", "Where will you settle down?

Many of its idiosyncrasies can turn into traps even for the most confident users. But some of the most binding rules in English are things that native speakers know but don\u2019t know they know, even though they use them every day. When someone points one out, it\u2019s like a magical little shock. This week, for example, the BBC\u2019s Matthew Anderson pointed out a \"rule\" about the order in which adjectives have to be put in front of a noun. Judging by the number of retweets\u2014over 47,000 at last count\u2014this came as a complete surprise to many people who thought they knew all about English: Things native English speakers know, but don't know we know: pic.twitter.com/Ex0Ui9oBSL \u2014 Matthew Anderson (@MattAndersonBBC) September 3, 2016 That quote comes from a book called The Elements of Eloquence: How to Turn the Perfect English Phrase. Adjectives, writes the author, professional stickler Mark Forsyth, \"absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that order in the slightest you\u2019ll sound like a maniac.\" Mixing up the above phrase does, as Forsyth writes, feel inexplicably wrong (a rectangular silver French old little lovely whittling green knife...), though nobody can say why. It\u2019s almost like secret knowledge we all share. Learn the language in a non-English-speaking country, however, and such \"secrets\" are taught in meticulous detail. Here\u2019s a page from a book, published by Cambridge University Press, used regularly to teach English to non-native speakers. An English teacher in Hungary sent it to us. From English Grammar in Use\u2014a self study reference and practise book for intermediate students by Raymond Murphy, published by Cambridge University Press in 1994. (Cambridge University Press) The book lays out the adjective order in the same way as Forsyth\u2019s surprising illumination. Hungarian students, and no doubt those in many other countries, slave over the rule, committing it to memory and thinking through the order when called upon to describe something using more than one adjective. The fact is, a lot of English grammar rules only come as a surprise to those who know them most intimately. Learning rules doesn\u2019t always work, however. Forsyth also takes issue with the rules we think we know, but which don\u2019t actually hold true. In a lecture about grammar, he dismantles the commonly held English spelling mantra \"I before E except after C.\" It\u2019s used to help people remember how to spell words like \"piece,\" but, Forsyth says, there are only 44 words that follow the rule, and 923 that don\u2019t. His prime examples? \"Their,\" \"being,\" and \"eight.\"", "When Scott Bringhurst went to the Gasconade County, Mo., sheriff\u2019s office last week to apply for a concealed-carry gun permit, he was shocked to see disparaging, doctored photos of President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton affixed to a wall. \"The courthouse should be a nonpartisan environment,\" said Bringhurst, a Hermann, Mo., business owner. \"That goes without saying. Especially if you\u2019re an employee who draws your paycheck from taxpayers.\" One fake image depicted Obama in a criminal booking mug shot and another purported to show an FBI agent taking Clinton away in handcuffs. A third photo shows Obama and Vice President Joe Biden with the caption: \"Joe, I am confused. Which bathroom do I use?\" So Bringhurst posted a complaint on the Facebook page of the local Hermann newspaper. The presiding county commissioner, Larry Miskel, happened to see it and sent an email to Sheriff Randy Esphorst asking the sheriff to take down the photos. Esphorst complied. \"It\u2019s a place of business,\" Miskel said in an interview Tuesday. \"I don\u2019t believe when you\u2019re conducting county business, your political views should be known, plain and simple.\" Miskel said he consulted with the two other county commissioners before sending the email. Esphorst, who like Miskel is a Republican, said the photos were examples of political humor that he was within his rights to put up. Moreover, he said the area of the office involved \u2014 where concealed-carry applicants and people arrested get fingerprinted \u2014 isn\u2019t accessible to the general public. \"Political humor has been around since George Washington\u2019s day,\" said Esphorst, who isn\u2019t seeking another term in this year\u2019s elections. \"Everybody has their little gripes and complaints. If I listened to and reacted to every one, it would be utter chaos.\" However, he said he complied with the commission\u2019s request because \"I\u2019m not going to argue with them. It\u2019s so minute and so ridiculous.\" Bringhurst, 47, who also complained last week to the Post-Dispatch about the photos, said Tuesday he\u2019s glad they\u2019ve been taken down. He said even if it was legal to post the photos, they were inappropriate and insulting. Bringhurst said he\u2019s a political independent who voted for Obama in 2008 and switched to Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson in 2012. This year, he says, he\u2019ll vote for a \"third party\" candidate but doesn\u2019t know which one.", "Talking to Tom Hiddleston for a piece in Not too long ago, Chris Hemsworth was spotted alongside Tom Hiddleston on the Australian set of Thor: Ragnarok (which was standing in for New York City) seemingly on the hunt for Doctor Strange. Whether that was confirmation of the Sorcerer Supreme making an appearance or just director Taika Waititi having some fun is hard to say, but Benedict Cumberbatch may have cleared things up.Talking to Tom Hiddleston for a piece in Interview Magazine , here's what the Sherlock star had to say about joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As you can see in the highlighted section, it seems as if Cumberbatch has confirmed that he'll also be part of the very impressive cast of Thor: Ragnarok. I felt it was all about the part rather than everything else. I've been to Comic-Con, and it's a very nice way to give back to the fans that drive these things. It was quite scary. I felt like Pink Floyd. It's just like, \"Hello, hi,\" after the fans are all screaming. That side of it is just phenomenal, and it makes me giggle, and I don't know whether I'll get used to that. I can't wait to see how it expands the universe. I'm also part of your crew! It's an amazing cast of actors. And it's the most fun hard work you'll ever do, I think, as an actor. They really know how to treat you right. And the material is challenging, witty, and a lot of fun to do. Doctor Strange is a complex, funny, but exciting character. It's hard to say for sure if Cumberbatch is referring to Thor: Ragnarok or the MCU in general, but him talking about Doctor Strange expanding this world and then saying he's part of Hiddleston's \"crew\" could point to the former.

Although KFC has since denied that this is the exact formula, we assume that it's close. The nephew, Joe Ledington, did have it in a handwritten note taken from the colonel's second wife's will, and he claims that his job as a boy was to mix the spice blend in a tub. The famous blend of 11 herbs and spices includes only one real surprise: a ton of white pepper. \"The main ingredient is white pepper,\" Ledington told the Chicago Tribune. \"I call that the secret ingredient. Nobody knew what white pepper was. Nobody knew how to use it\" in the 1950s. Food scientist Dr. Steven Witherly, author of \"Why Humans Like Junk Food,\" was taken aback when he saw the recipe. \"Wow, that much white pepper?\" he says was his first reaction. But he also thinks that it makes a lot of sense. \"I've had a lot of chefs tell me that the most underappreciated of all spices is white pepper because it has subtle but very strong effects on the sensory system,\" Witherly said. White pepper is the husked form of the more common black pepper. Cooks Illustrated says that it has a more floral, earthy flavor and greater complexity, while black pepper is more aromatic with more spicy heat. Interestingly, Google searches for white pepper have doubled over the past decade. White pepper also has some powerful physiological effects thanks to a compound called piperine. Piperine has been shown to do a wide variety of things, including activating taste receptors to make salt taste saltier and sugar taste sweeter, activating a special receptor in your brain that triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, increasing intestinal water flow and production of digestive enzymes, and possibly even helping to counteract the effects of high-fat diets. The upshot, according to Witherly, is that it could make KFC more addicting. \"One of the theories I've put forth is that if you eat something that does something to you and it's beneficial, your brain figures it out ... it wants you to do it again,\" Witherly says. KFC's alleged secret recipe is as follows: 2 cups white flour plus 2/3 tbsp. salt 1/2 tbsp. thyme 1/2 tbsp. basil 1/3 tbsp. oregano 1 tbsp. celery salt 1 tbsp. black pepper 1 tbsp. dried mustard 4 tbsp. paprika 2 tbsp. garlic salt 1 tbsp. ground ginger 3 tbsp. white pepper As great as white pepper may be, of course, other factors may be more important in making it delicious. Witherly concludes in \"Why Humans Like Junk Food\" that the key to KFC's deliciousness is the combination of flavor-active compounds flour, salt, pepper, and MSG with a pressure-cooking technique that retains the chicken's moistness and juiciness. And that's why 12 million people eat KFC every day.", "Living near the beach doesn\u2019t guarantee your happiness \u2014 but it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt. From Naples, Fla. to Honolulu, Hawaii, many of the U.S. cities that scored well on Gallup-Healthways\u2019 newly released Community Well-Being Index are located on the ocean. Researchers analyzed 350,000 interviews conducted in 2015 and 2016 to rank 189 communities by physical, emotional, financial, community and social health. Naples came in first for the second year in a row, followed closely by other metro areas near the ocean, like Barnstable, Mass. and Santa Cruz, Calif. So is beachside living the key to health and happiness? Lead researcher Dan Witters says it\u2019s not so simple: \"Clinical depression is less likely, and healthy eating is slightly improved, but after that the advantages run out.\" Holistic well-being is about more than good climate, Witters says. \"You don\u2019t need a beach to have someone who encourages you to be healthy; you don\u2019t need a beach to learn new and interesting things; you don\u2019t need a beach to get to the dentist.\" Highly ranked inland communities like Boulder, Colo. and El Paso, Texas had residents who reported feeling a strong sense of purpose \u2014 often rooted in a shared culture and a feeling of belonging. When people are invested in improving their community, they feel motivated to get out of bed each day, says Healthways president Karissa Price. \"It isn\u2019t just about physical health or income \u2014 there is a larger need to feel connected,\" she says.

If you're not already impressed by his age -- and that cool last name -- try this: Mr. Crosskill has been a member of the same golf club for 82 years. Eighty. Two. Years. Bunkered Magazine did a story on Geoffry after he broke the Guinness World Record for longest serving member of a golf club. And yes, we're also amazed that there is such a record. Crosskill recently broke the record when he reached 82 years and 18 days of continuously being a member at Eaton Golf Club in Norwich, England. \"I had nothing to do with it! My granddaughter did it all to surprise me,\" he told Bunkered. Perhaps, he had nothing to do with being recognized, but he put in all that time for the game -- and club -- that he loves. Crosskill said he became a member at 12 with a membership that cost the equivalent of about 1 pound today. Through the years, he's won a number of club competitions and made five holes-in-one. Even more impressively, Crosskill still plays nine holes three times a week and still maintains a 16-handicap. \"It\u2019s helped me a lot health-wise,\" he said. \"Without it I don\u2019t think I would be here, I think it has kept me very fit.\" Good for you, Geoffry.

(Photo by Astrid Riecken/Getty Images) With the calendar moving to February comes the opportunity to reflect on progression toward our goals for 2017. But how many people looked back in December and actually kept their 2016 New Year's resolutions? Very few.  But that doesn't mean it can't be done. It just means that people need to be mentally stronger and more resolute to hit those goals, especially their wealth goals.  Here are 6 financial habits of mentally strong people you can follow so that you can realize your money resolutions this year. They Maintain a Positive Outlook Toward Their Finances My attitude has always been, if you fall flat on your face, at least you're moving forward. All you have to do is get back up and try again. - Richard Branson Mentally strong people subscribe to Branson's notion that a positive attitude puts them in a position of control over their circumstances. They also apply this same principle toward their finances. In fact, research has shown that positivity is a hallmark of nearly all financially well-off individuals. You can follow in their footsteps too. Start by affirming out loud your financial goals for 2017. Remember, be specific and confident (for example, I will successfully save at least 10% of my income.). Voicing your goals with confidence is proven to help you better ingrain positivity into your brain and follow through on your plans. Once you have those positive vibes flowing, write down your goals, so that you can monitor your progress throughout the year.  They Surround Themselves with Others Sharing Their Vision for Financial Success Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher. - Oprah Winfrey As the saying goes, you are who you surround yourself with. This is especially true for the mentally strong. People associating themselves with others who are trustworthy, motivated and share their vision for financial success, naturally develop mental toughness. Why? Because they expand their financial horizons by collaborating with like-minded people and end up being that much more confident with their money. Still not convinced? Read Thomas Corley's Rich Habits: The Daily Success Habits of Wealthy Individuals. You might be surprised to find that over 85% of the rich in his study made a habit of associating themselves with other goal-oriented, success-hungry people.  They Dedicate Themselves to Lifelong Financial Learning I really had a lot of dreams when I was a kid, and I think a great deal of that grew out of the fact that I had a chance to read a lot. - Bill Gates Mentally strong people are voracious learners. That's because they're constantly hungry for knowledge and self-improvement. They actively strive to be better than the person that they were yesterday, and this translates into self-confidence and mental toughness. The same goes without saying for bettering themselves financially. Mentally tough people are always seeking ways to have their money work for them, not the other way around. Whether that takes shape in creating multiple streams of income or diversifying their portfolios, the mentally strong are relentless in honing their financial savvy. According to Corley's research, 88% of the rich devote at least 30 minutes per day to self-education or self-improvement reading. You can join them too. Start flexing those mental muscles and get ready to learn! They Keep Their Emotions Separate from Their Financial Decisions If you cannot control your emotions, you cannot control your money. - Warren Buffett We're all human. Which means that it's only natural that our emotions influence our decision-making process. Even though it's impossible to completely separate our emotions from the decisions that we make, the mentally strong take to heart Buffett's advice. One of the ways they're able to do that is by summoning the counsel of trusted financial and investment experts, with whom they have established strong relationships (which refers back to my second point!). They understand that their financial mentors can help them limit risk, leverage turnkey solutions to realize their financial goals faster and help them prevent their emotions from getting a hold of themselves before making important financial decisions.  They Live Below Their Means Living below your means has always been a go-to strategy of mentally strong people. They know they have money to splurge with but aren't spendthrifts in their daily lives, they still want value for their money. - Marsha Collier, best-selling author of 48 books, freelance author at John Wiley and Sons Mentally strong people have the financial discipline to hold off on buying the latest luxury vehicle and not going on compulsive shopping rampages. It also means that they're thinking long-term with their finances. By living below their means, mentally strong people are confident with what they have now and are able to envision the financial future that they are working towards on a daily basis.  They Pay Themselves First In order to be rich, you must have the self-discipline to pay yourself first. By this, I simply mean using your income to invest in cash-flowing assets before you pay your bills or buy anything fun. This, in turn, will create more income that you can use to invest in more, cash-flowing assets. Do that and you'll have more money than you know what to do with. - Robert Kiyosaki, Rich Dad author Paying yourself first is one of the most crucial pillars of personal finance. And mentally strong people abide by it. Before buying groceries, paying the electric bill or spending on anything else, they set aside money for their future. They do this because they know that an investment in themselves is a gateway to a secure financial future and are mentally tough enough to abstain from making unnecessary purchases that may feel good in the now. Some tangible ways that they pay themselves first are by funding their 401(k) accounts to the max and making it a habit to not only save a portion of their income but also invest that income into a well-researched portfolio that continues to grow as time passes.  Now that you know the financial habits of the mentally mighty, what will you make of 2017? And always remember that you're not alone on your financial journey - we're here to help. I wish you a peaceful and successful 2017!", "4. Basically, gum passes through your body just like any food \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t get completely digested.

It gives her an advantage in the pool over her female competitors since most do not have the strength to sustain it. (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) Katie Ledecky proved once again she is the best female Olympic swimmer of our time on Tuesday night when she won gold in the women\u2019s 200-meter freestyle at the Summer Olympics in Rio. She finished the race in 1:53.73, edging out Sweden\u2019s Sarah Sjostrom, who won silver with a time of 1:54.08. \"I did come pretty close to throwing up during that last 50,\" Ledecky said after the race. \"I knew I just needed to get my hand on the wall and be done. Everything was hurting. ... I just had to dig deep and do my own thing. I had no idea whether I touched first. ... I was done when I touched the wall. I knew I\u2019d given it everything I had to.\" [Michael Phelps extends his legacy with two more gold medals at Rio Olympics] Up next for Ledecky is the 800-meter freestyle. If she wins gold, Ledecky will join Debbie Meyer (1968) as just the second female in Olympics history to win three individual freestyle gold medals in the same Games. But Ledecky could do something even more extraordinary: break the eight-minute mark, a feat that, up until this point, has been seen only in the men\u2019s competition. It\u2019s not as crazy as it sounds. Ledecky has lowered the world record in the 800-meter freestyle by more than seven seconds in 29 months to its current 8:06.68. Before that, it took 26 years to lower the record by the same amount. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Benjamin Morris, Ledecky \"is pretty much the Secretariat of swimming\" whose \"performance in the 800 freestyle is the most any swimmer has dominated any distance.\" Ledecky already set a world record in the 400 freestyle earlier in the Games with a sizzling time of 3:56.46, making her the second woman (Italy\u2019s Federica Pellegrini was the first in 2009) to swim the 400 freestyle in less than four minutes. It\u2019s also the the 12th world record Ledecky has set since the 2012 London Olympics. Extrapolating her 400 freestyle gold-medal winning time in Rio, Ledecky would swim the 800 freestyle in 7:52.92. And while it is unreasonable to think Ledecky can maintain her 400-meter pace for twice the distance, that seven-second cushion could be enough to get her under eight minutes. Since 1968, there have been 10 women to compete in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyle events. The average finalist swam at a pace 14 seconds slower than their 400-meter time, and two \u2014 Irina Aksyonova (1980) and Keena Rothhammer (1972) \u2014 were within 10 seconds of their projected 800-meter time based on their actual 400-meter finishes. Rothhammer lost just 5.24 seconds off her pace when she made the distance switch in Munich, so there is precedent. But based on everything Ledecky has done so far, who would bet her against her?", "Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York. Photo via Wikimedia Commons Now that the nightmare search for escaped murderers Richard Matt and David Sweat has come to an end, New York's inspector general, state police, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are all looking closely at the prison they busted out of. On Tuesday, state officials announced that nine security officers and three members of Clinton Correctional Facility's executive team\u2014including Prison Superintendent Steven Racette\u2014have been placed on paid administrative leave, according to the Albany Times Union. That's not exactly a stunner given the sexually charged cooperation the escapees allegedly received from staff. But federal law enforcement sources told CNN Monday that the FBI is looking into the possibility that some kind of drug-trafficking ring was operating at the terrifying facility in Dannemora, New York. If any of the probes produce evidence of large-scale corruption at the prison, it would go a long way toward explaining just how Matt and Sweat made their daring escape on June 6. We already know that Joyce Mitchell, a 51-year-old civilian tailor at the prison, has been charged with putting tools into hamburger meat and smuggling them into the prison. Along the way, she seems to have involved a possibly unwitting corrections officer named Gene Palmer, who's charged with sneaking the meat around a metal detector in return for paintings by Matt, who was a talented portraitisted before he was killed in a shoot-out on Friday. Both Mitchell and Palmer have pleaded not guilty, and Sweat has reportedly told investigators the latter was not in on the plot. But Sweat and Matt were were part of the prison's so-called honor block, which afforded them greater freedoms than most. They were allowed to wear regular clothes and keep conveniences like refrigerators and hotplates, for instance, and a former maintenance supervisor at the prison told CNN that some prisoners have historically been allowed to perform electrical and plumbing work in the catwalk area that later served as part of Sweat and Matt's escape route. If the escapees were colluding with prison employees in some kind of drug-trafficking ring, they would likely have enjoyed still more freedom. Workers at Clinton have already admitted to knowing some prisoners were using heroin and have suggested employees were involved, CNN reported. Adding to the intrigue is that since David Sweat was captured alive on Sunday, he reportedly told investigators that he and Matt conducted a dry run of their escape the night before they pulled it off. Of course, once the two got out of jail, the police had their share of fuck-ups. Although Governor Andrew Cuomo has said state police \"did a better job than they've ever done,\" investigators initially weren't even sure Sweat and Matt had made it out of the prison, believing they might be holed up in its tunnels. State law enforcement also reportedly kept local police in the dark, and despite some 1,300 personnel, it took well over three weeks for New York's Finest to track the fugitives down. No one was killed by the dangerous murderers as the state police got their shit together, so this wasn't a total disaster. But the prolonged search must have cost taxpayers a pretty penny, and putting 12 prison workers on administrative leave until the corruption investigation gets sorted out will likely only add to that tab.", "Between hot cars, bike accidents, and hammock concerns, it can seem like summer is the prime time for parents to go into over-protection mode.

The 59-year-old star of travel food shows, like No Reservations and Parts Unknown, is famous for telling it like it is and being firm in his beliefs. So when we heard he thinks we're all wasting money on something in our kitchens, we needed to know more. According to Bourdain, we should all stop buying knife sets. In his 2000 memoir, Kitchen Confidential, he says medium-size utility knives advertised on TV are \"hard to sharpen\" and \"ineptly designed.\" We'll also add that they tend to be quite expensive. His solution? \"Please believe me, here's all you will ever need in the knife department: One good chefs knife, as large as is comfortable for your hand.\" But which one should you buy? Instead of investing in an expensive Henkel or Wusthof knife that requires maintenance that's not realistic for an amateur chef, he recommends opting for a lightweight and inexpensive vanadium steel Global design. Then, to use this tool for all of your slicing needs, he says to use the tip for small stuff and the area near the heel for larger stuff. The only downside: Purging your knife collection means you won't be able to enlist as many sous chefs to help you tackle chopping for your vegetable tray the next time you entertain.

[h/t Business Insider]", "The birth of feminism in the late 1960s and early 1970s featured young women burning bras as a counterpoint to young men burning their draft cards. They were considered statements of feminine independence. Now there\u2019s discussion regarding the medical merits of those demonstrations. The birth of feminism in the late 1960s and early 1970s featured young women burning bras as a counterpoint to young men burning their draft cards. They were considered statements of feminine independence. Now there\u2019s discussion regarding the medical merits of those demonstrations. Controversial findings have been made that at least associate excessive bra wear to non-malignant breast fibrocystic disease as well as malignant breast cancer. Some assert there is a definite link. Ironically, it was an American woman who invented the bra around the turn of the 20th Century. Up until the beginning of the 20th Century, corsets are what made women exhibit that desired hourglass figure and inadvertently pushed up the bust line for fashionable clothing of that time. Problem was, corsets messed with internal organs while shaping those hourglass figures, and their tightness resulted in women fainting easily and often. The Birth of the Bra In 1893, Marie Tucek made a \"breast supporter\" that looked like a modern brassiere. But a little later Mary Phelps Jacobs designed a better version and called it a brassiere. She patented it and sold the patent to a company named Warner Brothers Corset Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut for $1,500. It caught on. By the 1950s, teenage girls were urged to buy and use training bras to hold their breasts firmly in a desirable way and prevent sagging. But even the brassier industry admits that the only time bras prevent sagging is while wearing them. It\u2019s been observed that using artificial breast support long enough will cause the breasts\u2019 cup shaped suspensory Cooper\u2019s ligaments to atrophy, allowing the breasts to sag over time anyway. Exercises that strengthen pectoral muscles can be helpful. It\u2019s recommended to use a one piece sport bra for exercising. Some women use one piece sports bras as a healthier alternative for regular bras when not exercising. Bras and Breast Health Consequences The connection between wearing bras and painful and bothersome non-malignant breast fibrocystic disease as well as malignant breast cancer was hardly mentioned until the book Dressed to Kill by researchers Sydney Ross Singer and Soma Grismaijer came out in 1995. They surveyed 5,000 women and discovered that women who wore bras for 12 hours or more greatly increased breast cancer risk than women who wore bras less. Dr. Gregory Heigh of Florida has discovered that over 90% of women with fibrocystic breast disease find improvement when they stop wearing their brassieres. There are case testimonies (source below) from breast fibrocystic disorders who realized this when they stopped or at less lessened brassiere use. The connection between breast tumors, non-malignant or malignant and bras has merit when considering the lymph drainage issues from wearing bras too often. The lymph system, which includes lymph nodes in the breasts, requires body movement to pump out the lymph nodes accumulation of toxic waste materials. That\u2019s what bouncing on a rebounder is about. Not only are breasts\u2019 movements inhibited by bras to not allowing proper lymph nodes draining, but the actually tight enclosures of bras constricts the breasts and restricts lymph material flow. There was a study that attempted to debunk the link of excess bra wearing to breast fibrocystic disease and breast cancer, but that study itself was debunked in an There was a study that attempted to debunk the link of excess bra wearing to breast fibrocystic disease and breast cancer, but that study itself was debunked in an earlier RealFarmacy article. If a Florida doctor has observed 90 percent healing from fibrocystic breast disorders upon not wearing bras or wearing them less, and many other women have written in with positive results on their bra abstinence, it follows that wearing bras less or not at all helps prevent breast cancer.

This may seem like an effect of humankind\u2019s senseless, widespread idea that \"everyone is out to get me.\" But no, it\u2019s not. This villainy is real. This wickedness exists. This Instagram atrocity is overwhelming virtual reality and, likewise, all the alkaline snitches (talking pH 14). You might not believe me, so take a look at this evidence: All three?! That\u2019s no accident. Reddit user bemyfuse published a photo of sticker-covered Starbucks drinks and said: \"My petty joy is putting stickers on the siren logo when annoying teenagers order millions of fraps at once, so their Instagram posts are ruined  \u0304\\_(\u30c4)_/ \u0304 it\u2019s the little things.\" As said by the great Friedrich Nietzsche: \"Man is the cruelest animal.\"", "When was the last time you read the label, and how closely?  The ingredients list may reveal unexpected, and often unwanted, extra ingredients lurking in your favourite supermarket foods.    From pork fat in roast chicken bites to sugar containing traces of bones, these are the most alarming examples of when innocuous-soundings products contain very surprising additions.  BEEF OR PORK IN YOGHURT Many yoghurts, especially low-fat yoghurts such as Muller Light, contain gelatine.  Gelatine is of course made from skin, tendons, ligaments and bones of pigs and cows which are boiled in water, according to PETA. It is rich in collagen and commonly used as a gelling agent in desserts, dips, yogurts, sweets and marshmallows.  If you're Jewish, Muslim or vegetarian, you may want to read the label much more closely next time you go to pick up a yoghurt.  On its website, Muller says: 'We indicate if our products are suitable for vegetarians on the packaging. The following ranges include a good selection of vegetarian products: Mu\u0308ller Fruit Corner, Mu\u0308ller Crunch Corner, Mu\u0308ller Breakfast Corner, Mu\u0308ller Greek Style Yogurt Corner, Mu\u0308ller Rice, Little Stars fromage frais, Mu\u0308llerlight Chocolate Fix desserts and Amore\u0301.' BONES IN SUGAR As sugar isn't naturally white, some manufacturers use bone char to make it that colour - often referred to as 'natural carbon'. It is quite literally the charred bones of an animal. According to PETA, supermarket brands obtain their sugar from several different refineries, making it impossible to know whether it has been filtered with bone char.  SEAFOOD IN BANANAS Non-organic bananas are sprayed with a pesticide which may contain animal parts. According to Science Daily, the pesticide Chitosan, which fights bacteria and prevents bananas from over-ripening, is made from shrimp and crab shells.  PORK FAT IN CHICKEN BITES You would not expect to find pork fat in a packet of Asda roast chicken bites but it's there on the label - and if you're Jewish or Muslim, this could present a big problem. The pork flat is clearly listed on the ingredients list, however - which was not the case for a beef lasgane served up at restaurants owned by Whitbread. Just last week, the company was forced to apologise for using pork in its beef lasagne recipe without telling its customers. BEETLES IN RED SWEETS Red sweets or any other foods which are coloured with a natural red dye will more often than not contain animal products. Carmine, which is made from dead crushed up beetles, comes about when the insects are boiled with sodium carbonate or ammonia, which then produces the attractive, bright red dye.  ANCHOVIES IN WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE  It's often added to stews and a Bloody Mary to enliven them, but some Worcestershire sauces such as Lea & Perrins actually contain anchovies. The fish in the sauce gives it an umami flavour, which is what gives food a moreish savoury taste.  BEAVER IN ICE CREAM Some ice creams contain the ingredient 'castoreum' - which comes from a beaver's anal glands. It's most often found in natural vanilla ice creams and the ingredient is allowed to be called a 'natural flavouring'.  It's enough to put you off your raspberry ripple.  BEEF IN SAUSAGE CASSEROLE Some supermarket sausages, including cocktail sausages, are contained within beef casing and this is also the case with Tesco's sausage casserole. The pork-based dish contains beef as well, so steer clear if that puts you off. A spokesperson for Tesco said: 'We take great care to clearly label all our products to provide honest and helpful information so that customers can make an informed decision on what they wish to buy.'  HUMAN HAIR IN BREAD Some breads and pastries contain L-cysteine, an amino acid used in the baking industry as a dough conditioner and it's used to prolong the shelf life of many bread-based products. L-cysteine can be derived from human hair because it is the cheapest source of the acid.  WASPS IN FIGS There's a good chance that when you buy a fig, the fruit contains a dead wasp.  This happens when a wasp pollinates a fig and gets stuck inside the fruit and dies there. However, when you do bite into the fig, you won't be able to see the dead wasp contained within as an enzyme in the fruit converts the wasp into protein.  CHICKEN IN BEEF PASTE If you're buying beef paste, you'd probably expect the only meat to be found in the jar to be beef. But actually, the ingredients list of the Asda spread reveals that it is made up of 33 per cent minced chicken.  An Asda spokesman said: 'The ingredients in our products are carefully chosen to maximise quality, appearance and flavour, but everything is clearly labelled for our customers to make an informed choice.' ", "Tom Hanks has the scene in \"Captain Phillips,\" a moment that will play during the Academy Awards when Jennifer Lawrence announces Hanks as a Best Actor nominee on March 2, 2014. That Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in Paul Greengrass' new film should provide Oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor's awards chances. \"Captain Phillips\" is set to open the 2013 New York Film Festival, but Sony and producer Scott Rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on Toronto. Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment's own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\" The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. Like the best acting, Hanks' performance actually feels real. By the end of the film, it's hard to tell where Hanks ends and Phillips begins. This is the time of year when a new Oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (\"Gravity\" and \"12 Years A Slave\" reached the top of the line after raves last week). Yet \"Captain Phillips\" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for Hanks and Greengrass (a previous nominee for \"United 93,\" a film that bears similarities to \"Captain Phillips\" in structure and form), but for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Cinematography (Barry Ackroyd), Best Adapted Screenplay (Billy Ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps Best Supporting Actor for Barkhad Abdi. The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing Phillips' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that Greengrass deftly avoids. The problem is that Abdi doesn't have an easy road to Supporting Actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like Daniel Bruhl (for \"Rush\"), Michael Fassbender (for \"12 Years A Slave\"), Josh Brolin (for \"Labor Day\"), Steve Coogan (for \"Philomena\"), Bradley Cooper (for \"American Hustle\") and even Hanks (for \"Saving Mr. Banks\") potentially standing in his way. That, however, is back-room chatter for another day. For now, just know that \"Captain Phillips\" is one of those truly terrific movies that everyone hopes to see in the fall. It's riveting filmmaking. \"Captain Phillips\" opens on Oct. 11.", "Recreational marijuana will be legal for adults to buy on Jan. 1, 2014, but those adults will not be able to fly out of the state from Denver's main airport with their newly legal weed. In an effort to combat illegal interstate drug trafficking, Denver International Airport has announced that it intends to ban marijuana possession on all airport property beginning in early January, The Denver Post reported. DIA is the first city facility to prohibit marijuana possession. Flying with marijuana, even medical marijuana, is prohibited by the Transportation Security Administration, DIA spokeswoman Stacey Stegman told the newspaper. Although Colorado voters approved recreational pot in 2012, the substance remains prohibited under federal law. Adults in Colorado can possess up to an ounce of marijuana legally, residents can purchase up to 1 ounce of retail marijuana, while tourists can purchase up to a quarter-ounce at a time. And all of that marijuana will have to be consumed or remain in the state. On New Years Day, dispensaries in Colorado will begin to sell recreational marijuana to adults 21-and-over for the first time in U.S. history. As the marijuana laws in Denver and the rest of the state continue to evolve, the Denver city government has launched a website which aims to educate pot consumers on the do's and don'ts of legal weed. The website offers additional rules and information for residents, visitors, marijuana dispensaries, parents, business owners and home marijuana growers, featuring answers to the commonly asked questions about the groundbreaking new marijuana laws in the state.", "Bethesda has confirmed Elder Scrolls VI is in development but there\u2019s bad news There were a lot of big announcements and reveals in Bethesda\u2019s E3 2016 press conference. It also announced a brand new Quake game during the press conference. Despite all this, one thing that the fans missed during the press conference was the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6.

However, even though the game was not announced during the event, Bethesda boss Todd Howard confirmed that the game is in works in his own special way. Speaking to Geoff Keighley during a \"Youtube Live at E3\" interview, Howard let the cat out of the bag: It\u2019s good in these moments to tell our fans, \u2018Yes, of course we are [making The Elder Scrolls 6]. It\u2019s something we love.\u2019 But it is\u2013you know, I have to be careful what I say\u2013it\u2019s a very long way off.\" He added, \"I could sit here and explain the game to you, and you would say, \u2018That sounds like you don\u2019t even have the technology\u2013how long is that going to take?\" Howard also said they are working on two more projects which will be revealed before The Elder Scrolls 6, which means the latter won\u2019t be coming anytime soon. Vice President of PR and Marketing at Bethesda, Pete Hines, tweeted that he jokes with Todd Howard The Elder Scrolls 6 will release on 22/22/22. He also added that \"our robot overlords will change our calendar system by the time it comes out.\" I often kid Todd that release date for TES 6 will be 22/22/22.

It started with two sets of three parallel lines that were joined diagonally left to right, then capped off at the top and bottom with pointy bits. It was a fierce, beautiful \"S,\" and drawing it was addictive. Soon all my schoolbooks were covered in the \"S.\" I never questioned what it meant or where it came from. I just knew I loved it. But it turns out I wasn't the only one. I recently googled the \"S\" and discovered that although everyone loves it, no one knows its origins. Various Reddits and notice boards are full of really nostalgic people without a clue. It seems the \"S\" has appeared throughout all of North America, South America, Europe, Russia, Asia, and Australia. Some people think it's a 90s thing; others report seeing it as early as the 1960s. There were theories that it was the symbol of some 80s hair-metal band. Other people thought it was the original emblem for the clothing brand Stussy. Others thought it was an incarnation of the Superman logo. No one was sure. I thought I'd ask the office. \"That's the Superman 'S,'\" mused Ben, our in-house graphics guy. I asked him if that meant it was actually from Superman, but he said it wasn't. \"No, I think it's just what kids think when they're drawing it. They really just draw it because it's cool.\" I got on the phone to DC Comics to find out if they knew anything. According to Benjamin LeClear, who manages the comics library at their studio in Burbank, California, the \"S\" has nothing to do with Superman. \"It doesn't look like any of the emblems from the old Superman Shield logos,\" he said after rummaging through their collection. \"His 'S' has a lot of open space and almost never connects to itself.\" LeClear told me he'd become intrigued and, like me, launched his own mini investigation on the web only to turn up nothing. \"I didn't realize what a crazy urban myth and mystery this pointy 'S' thing is,\" he said. \"I would love for this to be Superman-related, but I don't think it is. Though Superman has the most famous 'S' symbol of all time.\" \"It's the Stussy 'S,'\" exclaimed Ramona, one of our producers. Like Ben's guess, she didn't think it was actually an emblem associated with Stussy, but refused to believe it had any other name. \"It's definitely called the Stussy 'S,'\" she said, then drew her own version that wasn't as good as mine. Pretty much every forum on the web mentions Stussy\u2014the Californian surf/street-wear company founded in the 80s. A lot of people seem convinced the symbol was originally a Stussy logo, so I called Stussy. \"No, this is not an original Stussy Logo,\" stated Emmy Coates, who has worked alongside Shawn Stussy since 1985. \"I personally get asked this a lot, but people have been drawing this 'S' long before Stussy was established. People have just assumed it was Stussy, and it's sort of spread from there. It's actually quite amusing.\" I finally asked Coates what she thought the symbol looked like. \"It looks like Suzuki logo,\" she replied. I was tempted to call Suzuki but didn't. I needed to zoom out and take in the bigger picture, so I got in touch with an expert in symbols and semiotics: Paul Cobley. Cobley is a professor in language and media at Middlesex University in London. According to him, the theory that it was a hair-metal symbol was also ridiculous\u2014\"It's certainly not the Saxon logo,\" he said. \"Theirs was far more sharp and had a staff.\" Then he offered the most likely yet bland explanation of all. That is, it's fun to draw. \"The reason kids go through this is probably because it's a Moebius strip ,\" he said, referring to the sort of looped one-surface shapes M. C. Escher was fond of drawing. \"It can't be drawn continuously, but it does have a perpetual flow.\" Moebius strip. I think he was onto something. Most nine-year-olds can't draw, so when someone hands them a magical recipe to create something fairly cool on demand, that'll go viral. Especially when the shape has the sophisticated, mathematical lineage of a Moebius strip. Yes I'd learned the term ten minutes earlier, but whatever. The \"S\" isn't a Stussy logo or a Superman emblem or a gift from aliens. I think it's just the most fun ever.", "The Philadelphia Eagles added another to their collection of statistically-struggling quarterbacks with the addition of Tim Tebow on Sunday. If signed, Tebow would join Mark Sanchez and Sam Bradford among the team\u2019s signal-callers. The three each rank in the bottom five in Total QBR among those who started at least 30 games over the last five seasons. Tebow ranks lowest with a 33.4 Total QBR. Sanchez is fourth-worst (40.4) and Bradford ranks fifth from the bottom (40.7). Tebow\u2019s completion percentage (48 percent) ranks the lowest in the NFL over the last 10 seasons. All three quarterbacks tend to overthrow or underthrow their passes quite a bit. Lowest Total QBR Since 2010 Tim Tebow 33.4 Geno Smith 35.7 Chad Henne 36.9 Mark Sanchez 40.4 Sam Bradford 40.7 * Minimum 30 games as QB Sanchez was off-target (over or underthrown) on a higher percentage of passes than any other qualified quarterback in the NFL over the last five seasons (22 percent), but that's only because Tim Tebow (30 percent overthrow rate) didn't rank in the top 30 in the NFL in pass attempts over that span. The one notable thing that Tebow has going for him is that his last playoff win came in 2011. That\u2019s more recent than any quarterback on the Eagles roster and three years after the Eagles\u2019 most recent playoff win. So why did the Eagles sign him? Tebow could become a zone-read specialist. The Eagles have utilized the zone-read option a league-high 514 times the last two seasons, 235 times more than the next closest team (Seahawks). In his NFL career, Tim Tebow has kept on 41 zone-read options for 256 yards. The only Eagles quarterback currently on the roster with any experience keeping on a zone read is Mark Sanchez, who did so six times for 38 yards last season. Overall, Tebow has rushed for 989 yards in his career. Sanchez, Bradford and Matt Barkley have combined to rush for 671 yards in their careers. Something else worth keeping in mind: The NFL is still considering adjusting the extra point conversion at this May's owners meetings. Among the suggested proposals, the league could eliminate extra points altogether (forcing teams to go for a two-point conversion). During his career, Tebow rushed the ball four times with his team at the one or two yard line. He scored on all four carries.", "Meet the Carolina Reaper pepper. It's literal hellfire.

What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten?  I\u2019m Nigerian so I feel like a lot of my meals are spicy and if the meal\u2019s not spicy, I feel like it makes me feel a bit sick. We have a Nigerian dish, it\u2019s called ayamase, it\u2019s basically a lot of Scotch bonnets and loads of peppers mixed together to make a stew and you have it with rice. VERDICT: Not the worst thing that's ever happened or that's gone in my mouth, haha. But yeah, it's spicy. Then Ryan.  What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten? My mom's side of the family is from Oklahoma, which is kind of like the Canada of Texas, and they all love barbecue and trying different hot sauces. The spiciest thing I've ever eaten was a chili made with Ghost chili peppers \u2014 the second-hottest pepper in the world. It made me feel stoned and my face went numb. VERDICT: I wanted to eat the whole thing, but that was dumb. Very, very dumb. Honestly, though, I'd put a little bit of this on pizza or something. Now it's Aisha's turn. What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten? I used to have chili competitions with my friend. We would try to make the spiciest chutney and we used to even put Naga Morich in it, which is a Bengali spice \u2014 and a close cousin of the Ghost chili pepper. VERDICT: I underestimated it. It was really hot and I thought I was going to cry. Laura's up next.  What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten? Growing up in a typical American, semi-Jewish household, there was not much spice going on. My brother did like spicy foods, but that was, like, Sriracha sauce. The spiciest thing I\u2019ve ever eaten would probably be, like, a curry. What\u2019s the spicy one? Vindaloo? VERDICT: I thought I was going to throw up. Also, this happened... And finally, Luke.  What's the spiciest thing you've ever eaten? I don\u2019t like spicy food. It just doesn\u2019t interest me. The spiciest thing I\u2019ve ever eaten was probably, like, this pasta I ate once that had a load of chilis in it. I don\u2019t know what the fuck they were, but they were chilis. VERDICT: It was really hot but, like, I could use it in cooking. My tongue hurt. Hurt quite a lot, but it's also not, like, intolerable.", "Whether we like wearing yoga pants and a t-shirt or dresses every day, sometimes our style doesn't always line up with what our significant other likes to see us in. I set out on a mission to see what my boyfriend of two years really likes me wearing and this is what I found out about his preferences, style and our relationship. The only two rules were I couldn't change the outfit he picked and I couldn't let him know what I thought about it. I set out on a very eye-opening mission. As a girl who rarely dresses up, except for work or a special occasion, my boyfriend has come to learn that it's a miracle if I'm caught wearing a dress with booties and my hair down. I Let My Boyfriend Pick Out My Outfits For An Entire Week. But he learned from very early on that loving me meant loving my minimal makeup, hair in a bun, yoga pants and t-shirt look. Despite my signature look, I decided I wanted to learn what he actually liked me wearing. Day One: We Started This Journey On Super Bowl Sunday. Luckily, since he had no preference in either team this year, my wardrobe was not decked out in Bronco orange or Panther blue. He picked out yoga pants, a jersey shirt (which he bought me in Minnesota) and Nike high tops, which I hadn't dug out of my closet in years. I Learned He Matches Clothes Better Than I Do. Needless to say he sure doesn't mind the yoga pants that I'm always wearing and he seems to like me wearing things he buys. And, for a guy, he has great matching skills. Day Two: The Journey Continued Through The Work Week. Again for my Monday attire, he picked leggings and shoes I haven't worn in years. Is he trying to tell me something here? Maybe we're getting at something. Day Three: He Even Got Inspiration For My Looks. The inspiration for this look came from \"Grease\" (maybe because we had watched it earlier that weekend.) Again a piece of clothing I haven't worn in years, my leather jacket, yoga pants and black wedge booties. I'm seeing a theme now. Day Four: Another Day, Another Sweater. I guess it is sweater weather, but I'm pretty sure I used up all of mine during this experimental week. So he likes the bundled up and comfy look? Sounds good to me! But Sometimes, He Was Just Cruel. A bunch of snow on the ground? Sure, let's make her wear wedged boots. Sounds like a fabulous idea. Ugh, guys just don't understand the struggle some shoes cause, especially in the snow! Day Five: Another Inspirational Look Came On Thursday. This look he called \"Tabby Thursday\" or in other words, \"How To Dress Like A Cat Lady: 101.\" He switched it up and chose jeans and paired them with my cat shirt and cat Vans. He's definitely not ashamed of my love for cats. The Cat Lady Wardrobe. I dodged a bullet on this day though, because he almost put me in jeans and a denim shirt. There's no way I could pull that off. The fashion gods were sure looking out for me. Day Six: His Methods Were Even Better Than Mine. When it came to picking out my outfit, he would lay everything out on the bed to see if it look good together. He would even stick the pants in the shoes to make sure the outfit matched. Now that's dedication. It's Sweater Weather. If I learn nothing else from this experience besides one thing, it would be that he likes me in sweaters, yoga pants and boots (in the winter, that is.) And I'm definitely not complaining. Day Seven: Our Journey Came To An Early End. Day seven rolled around and he gave up. I mean he threw in the towel, waved his white flag and forfeited. Despite being better at matching and picking out clothes than I am, he said he hated choosing my outfits since I had nothing cute to wear. Shopping spree? A Few Lessons Learned. At least I learned a few things from this journey, despite its abrupt end. The most important lesson? He'd rather be eating, playing video games, working out or doing absolutely anything else besides worrying about what I am wearing. "]
